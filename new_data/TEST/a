In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, certain Bible Students who were excellent public speakers felt that they could best carry out the commission to preach by delivering well - prepared talks to appreciative audiences.
They enjoyed public speaking, and some of them fairly basked in the warm adulation of their listeners.
However, it later became evident that Jehovah desires his people to get busy in a variety of forms of preaching, including the house - to - house work.
Some accomplished public speakers flatly refused to try anything new.
Outwardly, they appeared to be spiritual men, fully devoted to the Lord.
However, when faced with clear evidence of God’s purpose regarding the preaching work, their real thoughts, intentions, and motives became manifest.
How did Jehovah feel about them?
He did not bless them. They left the organization. ​ — Matt. 10: 1 - 6; Acts 5: 42; 20: 20.
But they were obedient. In time, they overcame their anxiety, and Jehovah richly blessed them.
How do you react when you are invited to share in some form of the preaching work that is presently out of your comfort zone?
Are you willing to try something new?
When Someone We Love Leaves Jehovah
12, 13. (a) What is Jehovah’s purpose in having unrepentant wrongdoers disfellowshipped?
(b) What test do some Christian parents face, and what makes the test so difficult?
No doubt we all agree with the principle that we must be physically, morally, and spiritually clean in order to please God. (Read Titus 2: 14.)
There may be occasions, though, when our loyalty to this aspect of God’s purpose is sorely tested.
Suppose, for example, that the only son of an exemplary Christian couple leaves the truth.
Preferring “the temporary enjoyment of sin ” to a personal relationship with Jehovah and with his godly parents, the young man is disfellowshipped. ​ — Heb.
11: 25. The parents are devastated!
On the subject of disfellowshipping, they know, of course, that the Bible says “to quit mixing in company with anyone called a brother that is a fornicator or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man. ”
They also realize that the word “anyone ” in this verse includes family members not living under their roof.
But they love their son so much! Strong emotions might cause them to reason: ‘ How can we help our boy return to Jehovah if we severely limit our association with him?
Would we not accomplish more by maintaining regular contact with him? ’
14, 15.
What is the real decision that parents of disfellowshipped children must make?
Our hearts go out to those parents.
After all, their son had a choice, and he chose to pursue his unchristian lifestyle rather than to continue to enjoy close association with his parents and other fellow believers.
The parents, on the other hand, had no say in the matter.
No wonder they feel helpless! But what will those dear parents do?
Will they obey Jehovah’s clear direction?
Or will they rationalize that they can have regular association with their disfellowshipped son and call it “necessary family business ”?
In making their decision, they must not fail to consider how Jehovah feels about what they are doing.
His purpose is to keep the organization clean and, if possible, to incite wrongdoers to come to their senses.
How can Christian parents support that purpose?
16, 17.
What can we learn by meditating on Aaron’s example?
Moses ’ brother, Aaron, faced a difficult situation with regard to two of his sons.
Think of how he must have felt when his sons Nadab and Abihu offered illegitimate fire to Jehovah and He struck them dead.
Of course, that ended any association those men could have had with their parents. But there is more.
Jehovah instructed Aaron and his faithful sons: “Do not let your heads go ungroomed, and you must not tear your garments [in mourning], that you may not die and that [Jehovah] may not become indignant against all the assembly. ”
The message is clear.
Our love for Jehovah must be stronger than our love for unfaithful family members.
Today, Jehovah does not immediately execute those who violate his laws.
He lovingly gives them an opportunity to repent from their unrighteous works.
How would Jehovah feel, though, if the parents of an unrepentant wrongdoer kept putting Him to the test by having unnecessary association with their disfellowshipped son or daughter?
18, 19.
What blessings can come to family members who work along with Jehovah’s instructions regarding disfellowshipped ones?
Many who were once disfellowshipped now freely admit that the firm stand taken by their friends and family members helped them come to their senses.
In recommending the reinstatement of one young woman, the elders wrote that she had cleaned up her life “partly because of her fleshly brother’s respect for the disfellowshipping arrangement. ”
She said that “his faithful adherence to Scriptural guidelines helped her to want to return. ” What conclusion should we draw?
That we need to fight against the tendency of our imperfect hearts to rebel against Scriptural counsel.
We must be absolutely convinced that God’s way of dealing with our problems is always best.
“The Word of God Is Alive ”
In what two ways can Hebrews 4: 12 be applied?
(See footnote.)
When Paul wrote that “the word of God is alive, ” he was not referring specifically to God’s written Word, the Bible.
* The context shows that he was referring to God’s word of promise.
Paul’s point was that God does not make a promise and then forget about it.
Jehovah established this through the prophet Isaiah: “My word... will not return to me without results, but it will... have certain success in that for which I have sent it. ”
Thus, there is no need for us to become impatient when things do not move ahead as quickly as we might wish.
Jehovah ‘ keeps working ’ with a view to bringing his purpose to a successful conclusion. ​ — John 5: 17.
How can Hebrews 4: 12 be an encouragement to faithful older members of the “great crowd ”?
Faithful older members of the “great crowd ” have served Jehovah for decades.
Many never expected to grow old in this system of things.
Still, they have not given in to discouragement.
They realize that God’s word of promise is not a dead issue ​ — it is alive, and Jehovah is working toward its fulfillment.
Since God’s purpose is dear to his heart, we bring joy to him when we keep it uppermost in our minds.
During this seventh day, Jehovah has been resting, secure in the knowledge that his purpose will be fulfilled and that, as a group, his people will support it.
What about you? Have you personally entered into God’s rest?
Many leaders among the Jews scrupulously observed the Mosaic Law, but when the Messiah arrived, they failed to recognize him.
They did not keep up with God’s advancing purpose.
See “Keep Yourselves in God’s Love, ” pages 207 - 209.
Today, God speaks to us through his written Word, which has power to affect our lives.
Thus, by extension, Paul’s words recorded at Hebrews 4: 12 can properly be applied to the Bible.
Do Not Miss the Purpose
• What is needed in order for us to enter into God’s rest today?
• What connection is there between God’s purpose and our willingness to accept Scriptural counsel?
• In what areas might obedience to Scriptural direction become difficult, but why is it essential that we obey?
• In what two ways can Hebrews 4: 12 be applied?

I Feared Death ​ — Now I Await ‘ Life in Abundance ’
As told by Piero Gatti
A LOW rumbling noise gradually became louder and louder.
It was followed by the wail of sirens warning people to take cover.
Then came the howl of bombs and destruction and a roar that burst the eardrums of the terror - struck.
That was Milan, Italy, in 1943 / 1944.
As a young soldier stationed there, I was often ordered to collect human remains buried in bombed - out air - raid shelters where people had been trapped, their bodies torn to pieces and unrecognizable.
Sometimes I myself narrowly escaped death.
On those occasions I prayed, promising God that if I survived the massacres, I would do his will.
Dispelling My Fear of Death
I grew up in a village about six miles (10 km) from Como, Italy, near the Swiss border.
At an early age, I came face - to - face with grief and the fear of death.
The Spanish flu took two of my sisters. Then in 1930, when I was only six years old, my mother, Luigia, died.
Growing up as a Catholic, I observed religious rules and attended weekly Mass.
But it was years later in a barbershop, not in a church, that my fear was dispelled.
In 1944, World War II was reaping a deadly harvest.
I was one of tens of thousands of Italian soldiers who had fled the war zone to neutral Switzerland.
Upon arrival we were taken to a number of refugee camps.
I was sent to one near Steinach, in the northeast of the country. There we were granted a certain amount of freedom.
The barber in Steinach needed temporary help in his shop.
I lived and worked with him for just a month, but that was enough for me to make an acquaintance that changed my life.
One of the barber’s customers was Adolfo Tellini, an Italian living in Switzerland.
He was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
I had never heard of this group, which was hardly surprising considering that at the time there were no more than 150 Witnesses in all of Italy.
Adolfo told me about wonderful Bible truths, promises of peace and of ‘ life in abundance. ’
I was enthralled by the message of a future without war and death.
Back at the refugee camp, I shared this hope with another young Italian, Giuseppe Tubini, and he too was impressed.
Adolfo and other Witnesses would visit us in the camp every now and again.
Adolfo took me to Arbon, about six miles (10 km) from Steinach, where a small group of Witnesses held meetings in Italian.
I was so enthusiastic about what I heard that the next week I walked there.
Later, I attended an assembly of the Witnesses at a convention hall in Zurich.
I was particularly struck by a slide presentation of extermination camps, showing piles of bodies.
I learned that many German Witnesses had been martyred for their faith. At that assembly, I met Maria Pizzato.
Because of her activities as a Witness, she had been given an 11 - year sentence by the Italian Fascist authorities.
When the war was over, I returned to Italy and joined the small congregation in Como.
I had not had a systematic Bible study, but I had the fundamental truths clearly in mind.
Maria Pizzato also belonged to that congregation. She spoke to me about the need for Christian baptism and invited me to visit Marcello Martinelli, who lived in Castione Andevenno, in the province of Sondrio.
Marcello was a faithful anointed brother who had been sentenced to 11 years by the dictatorial regime.
I had to cycle 50 miles (80 km) to visit him.
Marcello used the Bible to explain the requirements for baptism, after which we prayed and went to the river Adda, where I was baptized. It was September 1946.
That was such a special day!
I was so excited about my decision to serve Jehovah and now to have a solid hope for the future that when evening came, I hardly realized I had pedaled 100 miles (160 km) that day!
In May 1947, the first postwar assembly in Italy was held in Milan.
About 700 attended, including many of those who had lived through the Fascist persecution.
Giuseppe Tubini, to whom I had witnessed in the refugee camp, gave the baptism talk ​ — after which he himself got baptized!
At that assembly, I had the privilege of meeting Brother Nathan Knorr, from Brooklyn Bethel.
He encouraged Giuseppe and me to use our lives in service to God. I decided that I would begin full - time service within a month.
On arriving home, I told my family of my decision, and they all tried to dissuade me.
Yet, I was determined. So a month later, I started my service at Bethel in Milan.
Four missionaries served there: Giuseppe (Joseph) Romano and his wife, Angelina; Carlo Benanti and his wife, Costanza.
The fifth member of the family was Giuseppe Tubini, who had just joined them, and I was the sixth.
After one month at Bethel, I was appointed a circuit overseer ​ — the first Italian - born in the country.
Brother George Fredianelli, the first missionary to come to Italy from the United States in 1946, was already in the traveling work.
He trained me for a few weeks, and then I set off for this adventure on my own.
I particularly remember the first congregation I visited ​ — Faenza. Just think!
Up until then I had never even given a talk to a congregation!
Even so, I encouraged those in attendance, including many young ones, to think about taking up the full - time ministry.
It was a life of surprises, adjustments, challenges, and joys, and one in which I received great affection from dear brothers and sisters.
The Religious Scene in Postwar Italy Let me tell you something about the religious situation in Italy back then.
The Catholic Church reigned unchallenged.
Although a new constitution became operative in 1948, it was not until 1956 that the Fascist laws preventing Witnesses from preaching freely were repealed.
As a result of pressure from the clergy, circuit assemblies were often interrupted.
But sometimes the clergy’s efforts failed miserably, which is what happened in 1948 at Sulmona, a small town in central Italy.
The assembly was being held in a theater. On Sunday morning, I was the chairman, and Giuseppe Romano gave the public talk.
The audience was immense for those days. At a time when there were not even 500 publishers in the whole country, 2,000 people packed the theater.
At the end of the discourse, a young man, coached by two priests who were in the audience, jumped onto the stage. Intent on creating confusion, he started yelling at the top of his voice.
I immediately told him, “If you have something to say, rent a hall, and you can say whatever you like. ”
The audience was not impressed with him and drowned out his voice with expressions of disapproval.
At this, the young man jumped off the stage and disappeared.
I sometimes walked from one congregation to the next, rode my bicycle, traveled on battered, overcrowded buses, or took the train. On occasion, my accommodations were a stable or a toolshed.
The war had only recently ended, and most Italians were poor.
There were few brothers, and they were of little means.
Life in Jehovah’s service was wonderful just the same.
Training at Gilead
In 1950, Giuseppe Tubini and I were invited to attend the 16th class of the missionary school of Gilead.
Right from the start, I realized that it would be difficult for me to learn English.
I tried my very best, but it was a real challenge.
We had to read the whole Bible in English. To accomplish this, I sometimes skipped lunch to practice reading out loud.
Eventually, my turn came to give a talk.
I remember the instructor’s comment as if it were yesterday, “Your gestures and your enthusiasm are excellent, but your English is totally incomprehensible! ”
Despite this, I managed to complete the course successfully.
Thereafter, Giuseppe and I were reassigned to Italy.
With the extra training, we were both better equipped to serve the brothers.
In 1955, I married Lidia, whose baptism talk I had given seven years earlier.
Her father, Domenico, was a dear brother who had managed to help all seven of his children to embrace the truth, despite his being persecuted by the Fascist regime and being sentenced to exile for three years. Lidia too was a real fighter for the truth.
She faced three court cases before our legal right to preach from house to house was eventually recognized.
When we had been married for six years, Beniamino, our first son, was born.
In 1972 we had another son, Marco.
I am delighted that both of them as well as their families are serving Jehovah zealously.
During my happy life serving others, I have had many memorable experiences. For example, in the early 1980 ’ s, my father - in - law wrote to the then president of Italy, Sandro Pertini.
During the Fascist dictatorship, both of them had been exiled to the island of Ventotene, where perceived enemies of the regime were held.
My father - in - law requested an interview with the intention of giving the president a witness.
When his request was granted, I accompanied him, and we were cordially received ​ — something we were not at all used to. The president warmly greeted my father - in - law with a hug.
Then we talked about our faith and gave him some literature.
In 1991, after 44 years as a traveling overseer, I left the circuit work, having visited congregations throughout Italy.
For the next four years, I served as an Assembly Hall overseer until I had to lighten my activity because of a serious illness.
However, thanks to Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, I am still in full - time service.
I try to do my best to preach and teach the good news, and I am presently conducting some Bible studies.
The brothers still say that when I give talks, I have an “explosive ” enthusiasm.
I thank Jehovah that my vigor has not diminished with age.
As a youth, I was completely dominated by the fear of death, but gaining accurate Bible knowledge has given me a sure hope of everlasting life ​ — life “in abundance, ” as Jesus called it.
That is what I am now looking forward to ​ — a full life in peace, security, and happiness, with copious blessings from Jehovah.
May all honor go to our loving Creator, whose name we have the privilege of bearing. ​ — Ps.
83: 18.

Should Children Learn About God?
“We have just enough religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another. ” ​ — JONATHAN SWIFT, ENGLISH AUTHOR.
SWIFT expressed that thought in the 18th century, but many today would agree with him.
In fact, some believe that parents should not have the right to teach their children about God.
They feel that children raised in a religious household are somehow disadvantaged.
What do you think?
● Parents should not be allowed to teach their children about God.
● While the children are young, parents should pass on their own beliefs about God.
But as their young ones mature, parents should encourage them to reason on the matter for themselves.
● Children must adopt their parents ’ beliefs about God without question.
Does Religion Harm Children?
But do the facts support the claims of those who would prevent children from learning about God?
For decades now, researchers have intensely studied the effect that a parent’s religious beliefs have on children.
With what conclusion?
Researchers have found that rather than being a harmful influence, religion can have a positive effect on a child’s development.
In 2008 a report published in the journal Social Science Research * stated: “Religion has been shown to enhance the parent - child bond for both mothers and fathers. ”
This report also said: “Religion and spirituality appear to be an important part of many children’s lives and are vital to family relationships. ”
Notice how similar that finding is to what Jesus Christ said: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need. ” ​ — Matthew 5: 3.
What about the idea that children should grow up before learning about God and religion?
That view ignores this fact: A child’s mind is like an empty bucket waiting to be filled.
Really, parents face a choice; either fill that “bucket ” at home with the moral principles and beliefs that they feel are appropriate or allow the rainstorm of ideas outside the home to fill the child’s mind and heart.
What Is the Secret?
History proves that religion has the potential to fuel bigotry and hatred.
So how can parents avoid the outcome described by Jonathan Swift?
How can they teach their children beliefs that help them to love others?
The secret lies in finding the answer to three questions: (1) What should children learn?
(2) Who should teach them?
(3) What methods of teaching work best?
This study was based on information gathered from over 21,000 children living in the United States, as well as from their parents and teachers.
What Should Children Learn?
“All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness. ” ​ — 2 TIMOTHY 3: 16.
CHILDREN need to be taught the truth about God.
Where can they learn that truth?
In that letter, God reveals his personality and provides moral guidance for all of his children, both young and old.
Notice just some of the teachings contained in the Bible and the lessons that even young children can learn from them.
What does God want us to know about him?
▪ What the Bible teaches: “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth. ” ​ — Psalm 83: 18.
Lesson: God is not an impersonal force, but he is a real Person who has a distinctive personal name.
▪ What the Bible teaches: “All hearts Jehovah is searching, and every inclination of the thoughts he is discerning.
If you search for him, he will let himself be found by you. ” ​ — 1 Chronicles 28: 9.
Lesson: Jehovah God cares about all of us, including small children.
He wants us to learn about him.
▪ What the Bible teaches: “You people must not afflict any... fatherless boy.
If you should afflict him at all, then if he cries out to me at all, I shall unfailingly hear his outcry. ” ​ — Exodus 22: 22 - 24.
Lesson: Jehovah listens to the prayers of even small children.
We can talk to God regularly and express our innermost thoughts and feelings to him.
▪ What the Bible teaches: “Again and again they would put God to the test, and they pained even the Holy One of Israel. ” ​ — Psalm 78: 41.
Lesson: Our speech and actions affect Jehovah’s feelings, so we should think before we speak and act.
How should we treat those who are different from us?
▪ What the Bible teaches: “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. ” ​ — Acts 10: 34, 35.
Lesson: If God accepts people from all backgrounds, we should not discriminate against others just because their skin color or their facial features differ from ours.
▪ What the Bible teaches: “Always [be] ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect. ” ​ — 1 Peter 3: 15.
Lesson: When discussing religion, we should express our views with conviction but without aggression.
We should also show respect to those whose religious beliefs differ from ours.
How should we treat family members?
▪ What the Bible teaches: “Children, be obedient to your parents in everything, for this is well - pleasing in the Lord. ” ​ — Colossians 3: 20.
Lesson: Obedient children prove not only that they love their parents but also that they want to please God.
▪ What the Bible teaches: “Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a cause for complaint against another.
Even as Jehovah freely forgave you, so do you also. ” ​ — Colossians 3: 13.
Lesson: Other people, including our family members, will disappoint us at times.
But if we want God to forgive us, we must learn to forgive others. ​ — Matthew 6: 14, 15.
Why be honest and kind?
▪ What the Bible teaches: “Put away falsehood, [and] speak truth each one of you with his neighbor. ” ​ — Ephesians 4: 25.
Lesson: When we tell the truth, we imitate God and make him happy.
If we develop the habit of telling lies, we become like God’s enemy, the Devil, who is “the father of the lie. ” ​ — John 8: 44; Titus 1: 2.
▪ What the Bible teaches: “Treat others as you want them to treat you. ” ​ — Matthew 7: 12,“ Contemporary English Version. ”
Lesson: We should be considerate of the feelings, thoughts, and needs of our family members and others in our community.
When we show “fellow feeling, ” others are more likely to treat us in a kind way. ​ — 1 Peter 3: 8; Luke 6: 38.
As these examples show, the lessons contained in the Bible can help children to become appreciative, respectful, empathetic adults.
But who should teach these lessons to children?
Who Should Teach Children About God?
“A pupil is not above his teacher, but everyone that is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher. ” ​ — LUKE 6: 40.
SOME parents feel unqualified to teach their children about God.
They may think that they do not have enough education or do not know enough about religion to be good teachers.
As a result, they may be inclined to leave this vital task to a relative or to a religious leader.
Who, though, is really in the best position to teach children religious truths and moral principles?
Consider what the Bible says on this subject, and compare those statements with what researchers have discovered.
What Is a Father’s Role?
What the Bible teaches: “Fathers, don’t stir up anger in your children, but bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. ” ​ — Ephesians 6: 4,“ Holman Christian Standard Bible. ”
What researchers have discovered: How do fathers benefit if they develop strong religious convictions?
The article Fathers ’ Religious Involvement and Early Childhood Behavior, published in 2009, stated: “Involvement in a religious community may help men become better fathers.
Religion provides individuals with social support and control as well as a set of teachings and guidelines for how to live one’s life. ”
The Bible places great emphasis on the importance of a father’s role in raising and training children.
But is that counsel relevant today?
In 2009 the University of Florida published an article that discussed the impact that fathers had on their children.
The researchers found that children with fathers who were actively involved in their upbringing were more likely to be empathetic and to have a better sense of self - worth.
Boys were less likely to misbehave, and girls were more likely to have better mental health.
Certainly, the Bible’s advice is still relevant.
How Important Is a Mother’s Role?
What the Bible teaches: “Do not forsake the law of your mother. ” ​ — Proverbs 1: 8.
What researchers have discovered: In 2006 the Handbook of Child Psychology stated: “On average, mothers spend between 65% and 80% more time than fathers do in direct one - to - one interaction with their young children, and such ratios hold in many different lands. ”
With that amount of contact, a mother’s speech, actions, and attitudes have a profound effect on a child’s development.
When a mother and father work together to teach their children the truth about God, they give them at least two precious gifts.
First, the children gain the opportunity to form a friendship with their heavenly Father, a friendship that can benefit them throughout life.
Second, the children learn by example how a husband and wife should cooperate to reach important goals.
While others may be able to assist a father and mother, it is the parents who have the responsibility to teach their children about God and about how God wants a family to function.
How, though, should parents teach their children?
What methods are likely to work best?
How to Teach Children About God ​ — What Methods Work Best?
“These words that I am commanding you today must prove to be on your heart; and you must inculcate them in your son and speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up. ” ​ — DEUTERONOMY 6: 6, 7.
PARENTS may at times feel overwhelmed by the responsibility of training their children.
When they seek advice, however, the sheer volume of counsel on the subject may swamp them further.
Relatives and friends are often keen to pass on their suggestions. And books, magazine articles, and Internet sites offer parents a constant stream of sometimes conflicting advice.
The Bible, on the other hand, provides parents not only reliable counsel on what to teach their children but also practical direction on how to teach them.
As the Bible verses quoted above indicate, parents need to find some way each day to talk about God to their children.
Discussed below are just four Bible - based suggestions that have helped thousands of parents to teach their children about God.
Draw lessons from creation.
The apostle Paul wrote: “[God’s] invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship. ”
Parents can do much to help their children see God as a real Person by drawing attention to God’s creative works and then helping their children discern what qualities of God those creations reveal.
Jesus used this technique when teaching his disciples.
For example, he said: “Observe intently the birds of heaven, because they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses; still your heavenly Father feeds them.
Are you not worth more than they are? ”
Jesus here highlighted Jehovah’s qualities of love and compassion.
He helped his disciples reason on how God expressed those qualities toward his children.
Wise King Solomon pointed to the instinctive wisdom God gave to ants, and he used these little creatures to emphasize a valuable lesson.
“Go to the ant, you lazy one, ” he wrote,“ see its ways and become wise.
Although it has no commander, officer or ruler, it prepares its food even in the summer; it has gathered its food supplies even in the harvest. ”
What a powerful way to teach the value of setting worthwhile goals and then using our God - given strength to achieve them!
Parents can imitate the effective teaching of Jesus and Solomon by doing the following: (1) Ask their children which plants and animals interest them.
(2) Learn more about those plants and animals.
(3) Draw lessons about God from such creations.
Imitate Jesus ’ attitude toward those whom he taught.
Of all the people who ever lived, Jesus had the most important things to say.
Yet, he spent much of his time asking questions. He was keenly interested in the thoughts and feelings of those whom he taught.
Similarly, parents have many important lessons to teach their children. To be effective, though, they need to imitate Jesus and encourage their children to state freely how they feel.
What if children display a bad attitude or are slow to learn some valuable lesson?
Consider the way Jesus dealt with the apostles.
They at times argued bitterly among themselves and were slow to learn the benefits of being humble.
Yet, Jesus remained patient and repeatedly spoke about the need for humility.
Parents who imitate Jesus will patiently correct their children and, if needed, will repeat the same lesson until the children fully grasp its importance.
* Teach by example.
Parents do well to listen to the counsel the apostle Paul gave to Christians living in Rome.
To them he wrote: “Do you, however, the one teaching someone else, not teach yourself?
You, the one preaching ‘ Do not steal, ’ do you steal? ” ​ — Romans 2: 21.
That advice is relevant because children are far more impressed by what parents do than by what they say.
In fact, parents who practice what they preach are more likely to have children who listen to what their parents teach.
Start while the child is young.
The apostle Paul’s missionary companion Timothy had an excellent reputation in his community.
One reason was that “from infancy ” he had been taught“ the holy writings. ”
Timothy’s mother and grandmother not only read the Scriptures to him but also helped him to reason on the truths those writings contain. ​ — 2 Timothy 1: 5; 3: 14, 15.
Where You Can Find Help
Jehovah’s Witnesses produce a number of publications specifically designed to help parents teach their children the truth about God.
Some are written with young children in mind. Others can help parents and their teenage children keep the lines of communication open.
Of course, before parents can teach their children about God, they need to know the answers to some of the difficult questions that children may raise.
For example, how would you answer such questions as the following: Why does God allow suffering?
What is God’s purpose for the earth? Where are the dead?
Jehovah’s Witnesses would be happy to help you learn the answers to those and other questions so that you and your family can draw close to God. ​ — James 4: 8.
The Hebrew word translated “inculcate ” at Deuteronomy 6: 7 carries the thought of repeating a point often.
For younger children, parents can use the book Learn From the Great Teacher, which highlights the teachings of Jesus Christ, or My Book of Bible Stories, which relates in simple language key lessons from the Bible.
For youths, parents can use the books Questions Young People Ask ​ — Answers That Work, Volumes 1 and 2.
Keys to Family Happiness
Will * says: “When Rachel is upset, she cries for a long time.
If we sit down to talk, she gets irritable or even gives me the silent treatment.
Nothing seems to work.
I feel like giving up. ”
Rachel says: “When Will came home, I was crying.
I tried to explain why I was upset, but he cut me off. He told me that it wasn’t that serious, and I should just get over it.
That made me even more upset. ”
CAN you relate to Will or Rachel?
Both of them want to communicate, but they often get frustrated.
Men and women communicate differently, and they have unique needs.
A woman may long to share her feelings openly and often.
Many men, on the other hand, try to preserve peace by solving problems quickly and avoiding thorny issues.
How, then, can you bridge these differences and communicate with your husband or wife?
By treating your mate with respect.
Since childhood, you may have learned to respect people who have more authority or experience than you have.
In marriage, however, the challenge is to show respect for someone with whom you are on more of an equal footing ​ — your mate.
“I knew that Phil would listen with patience and understanding to anyone else who spoke to him, ” says Linda, who has been married for eight years.
“I wanted him to be just as empathetic with me. ”
Likely, you listen patiently and speak respectfully to friends and even strangers.
Yet, are you just as considerate to your mate?
Disrespect creates tension in the home and leads to bitter conflict.
A wise ruler stated: “A dry crust of bread eaten in peace and quiet is better than a feast eaten where everyone argues. ”
The Bible tells a husband to treat his wife with honor, or respect.
“The wife ” too“ should have deep respect for her husband. ” ​ — Ephesians 5: 33.
How can you communicate respectfully?
Consider some practical advice found in the Bible.
Many people like to talk more than they like to listen.
Are you one of them?
The Bible describes as foolish anyone who is “replying to a matter before he hears it. ”
So before you talk, listen. Why?
“I prefer it when my husband doesn’t try to fix my problems right away, ” says Kara, who has been married for 26 years.
“He doesn’t even have to agree or figure out why the problem arose.
I just want him to listen to me and validate my feelings. ”
On the other hand, some men and women hesitate to express themselves and feel uncomfortable if their mate pressures them to talk about their feelings.
Lorrie, who was recently married, discovered that her husband takes a long time to share his feelings.
“I have to be patient, ” she says,“ and wait for him to open up. ”
If you and your mate need to talk about something potentially divisive, raise the matter when both of you are calm and relaxed.
What if your spouse is reluctant to speak up?
Recognize that “a person’s thoughts are like water in a deep well, but someone with insight can draw them out. ”
If you draw a bucket out of a well too quickly, you will lose a lot of water.
Similarly, if you confront your mate too forcefully, your mate may become defensive and the opportunity to draw him or her out may be lost.
Instead, ask questions gently and respectfully, and be patient if your mate does not articulate feelings as quickly as you would like.
When your spouse does speak, “be swift about hearing, slow about speaking, slow about wrath. ”
A good listener listens not only with the ears but also with the heart.
When your mate speaks, try to understand his or her feelings.
Your mate will sense your level of respect ​ — or disrespect — ​ by the way you listen.
Jesus taught us how to listen.
For example, when a sick man approached him for help, Jesus did not immediately solve the problem.
First, he listened to the man’s entreaty.
Then he allowed what he heard to move him deeply.
Finally, he healed the man. When your mate speaks, follow the same pattern.
Remember, he or she is likely seeking heartfelt empathy, not a quick solution. So listen closely.
Allow your emotions to be touched.
Then, and only then, respond to your mate’s needs.
By doing so, you will show that you respect your mate.
TRY THIS: The next time your mate begins speaking to you, resist the urge to respond immediately.
Wait until your spouse has finished talking and you understand what was expressed.
Later, approach your mate and ask, “Did you feel that I was really listening to you? ”
“Sitcoms make it appear normal to speak badly about one’s mate and to be insulting and sarcastic, ” observes Linda, quoted earlier.
Some grow up in homes where disrespectful speech is typical.
Later, when they marry, they find it difficult to avoid this pattern in their own family.
Ivy, who lives in Canada, relates: “I grew up in an environment where sarcasm, screaming, and name - calling were the norm. ”
When you talk to others about your mate, share “whatever saying is good for building up as the need may be, that it may impart what is favorable to the hearers. ”
Impart a favorable impression of your spouse by the way you speak about him or her.
Even when you are alone with your mate, resist the urge to use sarcasm and name - calling.
In ancient Israel, Michal got angry with her husband, King David. She spoke sarcastically and said that he acted “just as one of the empty - headed men. ”
Her words offended David, but they also displeased God. The lesson?
When you speak with your mate, choose your words carefully.
Phil, married for eight years, admits that he and his wife still have disagreements. He has noticed that, at times, what he says makes the situation worse.
“I have come to realize that ‘ winning ’ an argument is actually a loss. I find that it is much more satisfying and beneficial to build up our relationship. ”
An elderly widow in ancient times encouraged her daughters - in - law to “find a resting - place each one in the house of her husband. ”
When both husband and wife dignify each other, they make their home “a resting - place. ”
TRY THIS: With your mate, set aside time to discuss the suggestions under this subheading.
Ask your spouse: “When I talk about you in public, do you feel honored or put down?
What adjustments can I make to improve? ”
Really listen as your spouse shares his or her feelings.
Try to apply the suggestions you hear.
Some newlyweds have mistakenly concluded that what the Bible calls being “one flesh ” means that the couple must have one opinion or personality.
However, they quickly discover that such thinking is idealistic.
Once they are married, their differences often lead to arguments.
Linda says: “One major difference between us is that Phil worries less than I do.
Sometimes he is able to relax when I’m worried, so I end up feeling angry because it appears that he doesn’t care about something as much as I do. ”
Accept each other as you are, and respect what is different about your mate.
To illustrate: Your eyes work differently than your ears; yet they cooperate so you can cross the road safely.
Adrienne, who has been married for nearly three decades, says: “As long as our viewpoints don’t violate God’s Word, my husband and I allow each other to have differing opinions. After all, we are married, not cloned. ”
When your mate has a different opinion or reaction than you do, focus not just on your own interests.
Consider your mate’s feelings.
Adrienne’s husband, Kyle, admits: “I don’t always understand or agree with my wife’s opinions on matters.
But I remind myself that I love her much more than I love my opinion.
When she is happy, I really am too. ”
TRY THIS: Make a list of ways that your mate’s viewpoint or way of handling things is superior to yours. ​ — Philippians 2: 3.
Respect is one of the keys to a happy and lasting marriage.
“Respect brings contentment and security to a marriage, ” says Linda.
“It is definitely worth cultivating. ”
Names have been changed.
How have my mate’s differences enriched our family?
Why is it good to yield to my mate’s preference whenever Bible principles are not at issue?

How Can You Recognize True Worship?
This article raises questions you may have asked and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible.
Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.
Is there only one true religion?
Jesus taught his followers only one religion, the true religion.
It is like a road leading to life.
Regarding that road, Jesus said: “Few are the ones finding it. ”
God accepts only worship based on his Word of truth.
All true worshippers are united in one faith. ​ — Read John 4: 23, 24; 14: 6; Ephesians 4: 4, 5.
Why do so many different religions claim to be Christian?
False prophets have corrupted Christianity and have used it to further their own interests.
As Jesus foretold, they present themselves as his “sheep ” but act like hungry wolves.
False Christianity developed especially after Jesus ’ apostles died. ​ — Read Acts 20: 29, 30.
What are some features that distinguish true worship?
True worshippers respect the Bible as God’s Word.
They strive to live by its principles.
So true religion differs from religion based on men’s ideas.
True worshippers do not preach one thing and practice another. ​ — Read John 17: 17; 2 Timothy 3: 16, 17.
The true religion honors God’s name, Jehovah.
Jesus made God’s name known.
He helped people to know God and taught them to pray that God’s name be sanctified.
Where you live, which religion promotes the use of God’s name? ​ — Read John 17: 26; Romans 10: 13, 14.
How can you recognize true worshippers?
True Christians preach about God’s Kingdom.
God sent Jesus to preach about the Kingdom.
God’s Kingdom is the only hope for mankind.
Jesus continued speaking about it until his dying day.
He told his followers to preach about God’s Kingdom.
If someone approaches you to speak about God’s Kingdom, to which religion does he likely belong? ​ — Read Matthew 10: 7; 24: 14.
Jesus ’ followers are no part of this wicked world.
They take no part in political affairs or social conflicts.
Also, they do not imitate the world’s harmful practices and attitudes. ​ — Read James 1: 27; 4: 4.
What is the primary mark of true Christianity?
True Christians have outstanding love for one another.
From God’s Word, they learn to respect members of all ethnic groups.
Although false religion has often strongly supported the wars of the nations, true worshippers refuse to do so.
Rather, members of the true religion unselfishly use their time and resources to help and encourage others. ​ — Read John 13: 34, 35; 1 John 4: 20, 21.
Which group bases all its teachings on God’s Word, honors God’s name, and proclaims God’s Kingdom as mankind’s only hope?
Which group practices love and does not support war?
The facts point to Jehovah’s Witnesses. ​ — 1 John 3: 10 - 12.
For more information, see chapter 15 of this book, What Does the Bible Really Teach?, published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.
[Picture on page 16]
“They publicly declare they know God, but they disown him by their works. ” ​ — Titus 1: 16
Is the Pope “Saint Peter’s Successor ”?
IN 2002, Pope John Paul II wrote a letter to the bishop of Limburg, Germany, overruling a decision by the bishop in connection with abortion.
The pope introduced his directive by stating that he was responsible for “the well - being and unity of all individual churches according to the will of Jesus Christ. ”
He claimed authority to overrule the bishop’s decision because as pope, he is said to be “Saint Peter’s successor. ”
According to a Roman Catholic definition, “Christ constituted St. Peter chief of all the apostles. ”
The Catholic Church further asserts that “Christ established that Peter should have perpetual successors in this primacy; and that the Roman bishops are these successors. ” ​ — New Catholic Encyclopedia (2003), Volume 11, pages 495 - 496.
Those are important claims.
Have you examined their validity for yourself?
Consider the answers to three questions: (1) Does the Bible support the claim that Peter was the first pope?
(2) What does history teach about the origin of the succession of popes?
(3) Do the conduct and teachings of the popes support their claim to be Peter’s successor?
Was Peter the First Pope?
To prove that the church is founded on Peter, Catholics have long pointed to Jesus ’ words recorded at Matthew 16: 18: “You are Peter, and on this rock - mass I will build my congregation. ”
In fact, those words are inscribed in Latin under the dome of St.
Peter’s Basilica in Rome.
Augustine, a revered Church Father, at one time held that the congregation was built on Peter.
However, toward the end of his life, he changed his view of what Jesus ’ words meant.
In a work known as Retractations, Augustine argued that it was Jesus on whom the church, that is the Christian congregation, was built, not Peter.
True, the apostle Peter features prominently in the Gospels.
Jesus singled out three of his apostles ​ — John, James, and Peter — ​ to be present with him on a few special occasions.
Jesus entrusted Peter with “the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, ” which Peter used to open up the way to the Kingdom ​ — first to the Jews and proselytes, then to the Samaritans, and finally to the Gentiles.
In accord with his outgoing personality, Peter at times served as spokesman for the apostles as a whole.
But do these facts make Peter head of the early congregation?
The apostle Paul did write that Peter was entrusted with an “apostleship to those who are circumcised. ”
However, the context of Paul’s words shows that he was not saying that Peter directed the congregation.
Although Peter was given great responsibility, nowhere in the Bible do we find him claiming to be the head of the congregation and, as such, making decisions for the disciples as a group.
In his letter, he called himself “an apostle ” and“ an older man ” ​ — nothing more. ​ — 1 Peter 1: 1; 5: 1.
What Does History Teach About the Origin of the Papacy?
When and how, then, did the concept of a papacy come about?
The idea that it was acceptable for one man to seek prominence over his fellow believers began to take root while the apostles were still alive.
How did the apostles view such thinking?
The apostle Peter himself told the men who were taking the lead in the congregation not to be “lording it over those who are God’s inheritance ”; they were to gird themselves with lowliness of mind toward one another.
The apostle Paul warned that from within the congregation, men would rise who would “speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves. ”
Toward the end of the first century C.E., the apostle John wrote a letter in which he strongly denounced a disciple by the name of Diotrephes. Why the reprimand?
One reason was that this man ‘ liked to have the first place ’ in the congregation.
Such counsel from the apostles acted as a restraint, thwarting for a time the ambitions of those who were seeking prominence. ​ — 2 Thessalonians 2: 3 - 8.
Shortly after the last of the apostles died, individuals began to gain more prominence.
The Cambridge History of Christianity says: “Probably there was no single ‘ monarchical ’ bishop in Rome before the middle of the second century. ”
By the third century, the bishop of Rome established himself as the highest authority, at least for parts of the church.
* To add weight to the claim that the bishop of Rome has superior authority, some have compiled a list of Peter’s successors.
However, this list provides little support for the claim.
First, some names on the list cannot be verified.
More important, the foundation of the list is flawed.
How so?
Even if Peter did preach in Rome, as some secular literature from the first and second centuries implies, there is no proof that he was head of the congregation there.
One evidence that Peter was not head of the congregation in Rome is that when the apostle Paul wrote his letter to the Romans, he included an extensive list of Christians there.
Yet, he did not mention Peter at all. If Peter were head of the congregation, could we imagine that Paul overlooked Peter or snubbed him?
Note, too, that about the time that Peter wrote his first inspired letter, Paul wrote a second letter to Timothy.
In that letter, Paul did not hesitate to mention Rome.
Actually, Paul wrote six letters from Rome, all without any mention of Peter.
Some 30 years after Paul wrote his letters, the apostle John wrote three letters and the book of Revelation.
Nowhere in these writings did John mention that the congregation in Rome was the most prominent one, nor did he refer to a leader of the church who held the supreme office of an alleged successor of Peter.
Neither the Bible nor the evidence from history supports the claim that Peter established himself as the first bishop of the congregation in Rome.
Do the Conduct and Teachings of the Popes Support Their Claim?
We would rightly expect someone who claims to be “Saint Peter’s successor ” and“ the Vicar of Christ ” to follow the conduct and teachings of both Peter and Christ.
For example, did Peter accept special treatment from his fellow believers? No.
He refused to allow any special expressions of reverence to be bestowed on him.
What about Jesus?
He said that he came to serve others, not to be served.
By contrast, what record do the popes have?
Do they shun prominence, refuse grand titles, and avoid ostentatious displays of wealth and power?
Both Peter and Christ were morally upright men who promoted peace.
Compare their record with what the Catholic encyclopedia Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche (Lexicon for Theology and Church) says about Pope Leo X: “Involved in political and often nepotistic transactions and devoted to lavish worldly pleasures, Leo X neglected the urgent tasks of a spiritual nature. ”
Karl Amon, Catholic priest and professor of church history, says that verified reports regarding Pope Alexander VI betray “a terrific amount of unscrupulousness, abuse of authority, simony, and immorality. ”
What about the teachings of the popes? How do they compare with the teachings of Peter and Christ?
With reference to good King David, he plainly said: “David did not ascend to the heavens. ”
Nor did Peter teach that infants should be baptized.
Rather, he taught that baptism is a step that a believer takes conscientiously. ​ — 1 Peter 3: 21.
Jesus taught that none of his disciples should try to be more prominent than any other. “If anyone wants to be first, ” Jesus said,“ he must be last of all and minister of all. ”
Shortly before his death, Jesus gave this clear directive to his followers: “Do not you be called Rabbi, for one is your teacher, whereas all you are brothers.
Moreover, do not call anyone your father on earth, for one is your Father, the heavenly One.
Neither be called ‘ leaders, ’ for your Leader is one, the Christ. ”
Do you feel that the popes have upheld the teachings of Peter and Christ?
Some say that the succession of popes is maintained even if the officeholder does not lead a Christian life.
Do you think that argument is reasonable?
Jesus said: “Every good tree produces fine fruit, but every rotten tree produces worthless fruit; a good tree cannot bear worthless fruit, neither can a rotten tree produce fine fruit. ”
Based on the evidence, do you think that Peter or Christ would want to be associated with the fruits that the popes have produced? ​ — Matthew 7: 17, 18, 21 - 23.
Jesus ’ discussion with Peter centered on identifying the Christ and his role, not on the role that Peter would play.
Peter himself later stated that Jesus was the rock upon which the congregation was built.
The apostle Paul confirmed that Jesus, not Peter, was “the foundation cornerstone ” of the Christian congregation. ​ — Ephesians 2: 20.
Both Jesus and the apostles warned that the Christian congregation would be overrun by men who taught apostate doctrine.
Those statements came true when the church, or congregation, of the second century began adopting pagan customs and blending Biblical doctrine with Greek philosophy.

Does the evidence indicate that the popes have followed Peter’s example?

6 Ideas for Family Worship and Personal Study

32 Do You Remember?
The Internet ​ — Making Wise Use of a Global Tool
THE invention of printing, centuries ago, changed the way in which people communicate with one another. The invention of the Internet in modern times has been compared to that.
This practical tool has been called a global tool of communication, and rightly so.
The ability to communicate is a wonderful gift from our Creator.
It enables us to exchange ideas and share information with others.
Jehovah was the first to communicate with his human family, providing clear, unambiguous information on how to lead a meaningful life.
As made evident by what happened early in human history, however, the gift of communication can be misused.
Satan gave utterly false information to Eve.
She accepted what he said and passed it on to Adam, who led humankind into a course of calamity. ​ — Gen.
3: 1 - 6; Rom.
5: 12.
What can be said about using the Internet?
While the Internet can provide valuable information, save us time, and serve a useful function, it can also misinform us, consume an inordinate amount of our time, and corrupt us morally.
Let us consider how we can use this global tool to our benefit.
Information ​ — Reliable or False?
Never assume that all information found on the Internet is good and beneficial.
Internet search engines might be compared to a legion of mushroom pickers who tirelessly collect all types of mushrooms ​ — edible as well as poisonous — ​ throwing them into a single container and dishing them out for us to eat.
Would you start eating these mushrooms without carefully examining each one?
Internet search engines use a huge number of computers to harvest or select from billions of Web pages containing everything from the very best to the very worst.
We need discernment to separate the wheat from the chaff, as it were, lest we poison our minds with misinformation.
In 1993 a well - known magazine had a cartoon showing two dogs in front of a computer.
One dog explains to the other: “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog. ”
Long ago, Satan hid behind a serpent to start a “chat ” with Eve and told her that she could be like God.
Today, anyone with an Internet connection can become a desktop professor, pretending to be in the know, without even revealing his name.
And there are no rules on who can publish ideas, information, images, and suggestions.
Do not become an “Internet Eve. ”
Be critical and suspicious of the information. Before trusting it, ask: (1) Who published this material?
What are the author’s credentials? (2) Why was this published?
Is there any bias? (3) Where did the author get the information?
(4) Is the information current?
In the first century, the apostle Paul gave Timothy advice that applies with equal force today.
Paul wrote: “Guard what is laid up in trust with you, turning away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from the contradictions of the falsely called ‘ knowledge. ’ ” ​ — 1 Tim. 6: 20.
Saves Time or Takes Time?
If used wisely, the Internet can undoubtedly save us time, energy, and funds.
We can conveniently buy something without leaving home.
Comparing prices may help us save money.
Online banking has made the life of many people easier; financial matters can be handled at any time in the comfort of our home.
The Internet provides essential tools to work out a convenient and economical itinerary for a trip we may be planning and helps us make the necessary bookings.
With a little effort, we can look up phone numbers, addresses, and various ways to get to our intended destination.
Worldwide, branch offices of Jehovah’s Witnesses use many of these services to save time, personnel, and funds.
There is, however, a dark side to be considered.
It concerns the amount of time that using the Internet may consume. For some, the Internet has become a fascinating toy instead of a helpful tool. They spend excessive amounts of time playing, shopping, chatting, e - mailing, searching, and surfing.
Eventually, they may start to neglect the more important things involving family, friends, and congregation. The Internet can even become addictive. For example, an estimate published in 2010 indicated that 18.4 percent of Korean adolescents were affected by Internet addiction.
German researchers stated that “more and more women are complaining about the addiction [of] their partners. ”
One woman complained that dependence on the Internet has changed her husband dramatically to the point that it has destroyed their marriage.
A branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses received a letter from an individual who called himself an Internet junkie.
He sometimes spent up to ten hours a day on the Internet.
After remarking that “at first, it all seemed so innocent, ” he added:“ In time, my meeting attendance dwindled and I stopped praying. ”
When he went to the meetings, he was unprepared and his mind was at home longing to “be able to log on again. ”
Happily, he realized the seriousness of the problem and took measures to correct it.
May we never get to the point that using the Internet has become an addiction for us.
At 1 Thessalonians 5: 21, 22, we read: “Make sure of all things; hold fast to what is fine.
Abstain from every form of wickedness. ”
We need to determine whether the information we find on the Internet is worthy of God’s approval, meeting his high standards.
It should be morally unobjectionable and appropriate for a Christian.
Internet pornography has become especially pervasive, and if we are not careful, it can easily lure us into its trap.
We are wise to ask ourselves, ‘ Is what I see on the screen something I would quickly hide from my mate, my parents, or my Christian brothers if they entered the room? ’
If the answer is yes, we would do well to use the Internet only when others are present.
The Internet has indeed changed the way we communicate and shop. In addition, it has opened up a completely new way to ‘ commit adultery in our heart. ’ ​ — Matt. 5: 27, 28.
To Forward or Not to Forward?
Using the Internet includes getting information as well as distributing it.
Though we have the freedom to obtain and pass on information, we also have the responsibility to ascertain its truthfulness and morality.
Can we vouch for the accuracy of what we write or forward to others?
Do we have permission to pass the information on?
* Is it worthwhile and upbuilding?
What are our motives in making it available?
Do we want to do so simply to impress others?
It can also flood us with information.
Are we overloading others by broadcasting the latest news or trivia to long lists of acquaintances, perhaps consuming their valuable time?
Should we not examine our motives before we hit the send button?
What do we really want to accomplish?
People used to write letters to share their own experiences with family and friends, keeping them up - to - date with what was going on in their life.
Should this not be the focus of our e - mail?
Why pass on to others something we cannot verify?
So, then, what should we do with regard to the Internet?
Shun it altogether? That may be necessary in some cases.
The Internet junkie mentioned earlier did that in order to overcome years of addiction.
On the other hand, using the Internet can benefit us, provided we let ‘ thinking ability keep guard over us and discernment safeguard us. ’ ​ — Prov.
2: 10, 11.
The same applies to photos.
Though we may take pictures for our own use, we may not be at liberty to distribute them, much less supply the names of the people represented in the photos and indicate where they live.

How can you avoid becoming a victim of misinformation?

What should you consider before hitting the send button?
Ideas for Family Worship and Personal Study
AT THE beginning of 2009, congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide adjusted their meeting schedule.
The two midweek meetings were combined, and all were encouraged to use the free evening for family worship or personal study. Have you been taking advantage of the new arrangement?
Are you benefiting fully from it?
Some have wondered what material they should select for consideration during family worship.
It is not the intention of the Governing Body to establish one format for all families.
Since circumstances vary, it is appropriate for each family head or individual to evaluate how this weekly occasion can be used in the best way.
Some have been preparing for congregation meetings, but family worship need not be limited to that.
Others have been reading, discussing, and even dramatizing Scriptural information, especially for the benefit of younger children.
It may not always be necessary or even desirable to use a question - and - answer method, as is done at formal meetings.
A relaxed atmosphere is often more conducive to a stimulating discussion and the exchange of ideas.
Such an atmosphere promotes creative thinking, which can make the occasion memorable and enjoyable for all.
One father of three children writes: “What we have been doing is mostly based on the Bible reading.
We each read the chapters ahead of time, the children pick some aspect for research, and then they present their findings.
Michael [age seven] will often draw a picture or write a paragraph.
David and Kaitlyn [ages 13 and 15] might write about a Bible account from the point of view of an observer.
For example, when we were reading about Joseph’s interpretation of the dreams of Pharaoh’s baker and his cupbearer, Kaitlyn wrote a composition from the standpoint of a prisoner watching the scene unfold. ” ​ — Gen., chap.
40. Naturally, situations differ. What works for one individual or family may not work for another.
The accompanying box presents a number of ideas that may be used during your periods of family worship or personal study.
Very likely, you can think of many others.
[Box / ​ Picture on pages 6, 7]
For families with teens:
• Read and discuss Questions Young People Ask ​ — Answers That Work.
• Practice “What if...? ” situations.
(See The Watchtower of May 15, 1996, page 14, paragraphs 17 - 18.)
• Talk about long - term and short - term goals.
• From time to time, watch and discuss a Bible - based video.
• Consider the Watchtower feature “For Young People. ”
For couples with no children:
• Discuss chapters 1, 3, 11 - 16 of the book The Secret of Family Happiness.
• Share the results of research on points from Bible reading.
• Prepare for the Congregation Bible Study or the Watchtower Study.
• Discuss ways to expand your ministry as a couple.
For single brothers and sisters or for those in religiously divided households:
• Study new publications received at district conventions.
• Read current and past Yearbooks.
• Do research on questions common in your local territory.
• Prepare presentations for the field ministry.
For families with young children:
• Dramatize Bible scenes.
• Play memory games, such as those on pages 30 and 31 of Awake!
• Occasionally, do something imaginative. (See “Studying the Bible ​ — In the Zoo! ” in Awake!
of March 8, 1996, pages 16 - 19.)
• Consider the Watchtower feature “Teach Your Children. ”
They Waited for the Messiah
“The people were waiting, and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John, whether he were not the Messiah. ” ​ — LUKE 3: 15, THE EMPHATIC DIAGLOTT.
NIGHT has fallen.
Shepherds are out - of - doors, keeping watch over their flocks.
How startled they are when Jehovah’s angel stands nearby and God’s glory gleams around them!
Listen! The angel makes this dramatic proclamation: “Have no fear, for, look!
I am declaring to you good news of a great joy that all the people will have, because there was born to you today a Savior, who is Christ the Lord, ” the one who would prove to be the Messiah.
The shepherds can find this infant lying in a manger in a nearby town.
Suddenly, “a multitude of the heavenly army ” begin praising Jehovah, saying:“ Glory in the heights above to God, and upon earth peace among men of goodwill. ” ​ — Luke 2: 8 - 14.
What does “Messiah ” mean, and how can he be identified?
Of course, the Jewish shepherds know that “Messiah, ” or“ Christ, ” refers to God’s “Anointed One. ”
But how can they learn more and convince others that the baby mentioned by the angel will be Jehovah’s appointed Messiah?
By examining prophecies found in the Hebrew Scriptures and comparing these with the activities and life course of this child.
Why Were People in Expectation?
3, 4.
How do we understand Daniel 9: 24, 25?
When John the Baptizer came on the scene years later, his words and deeds led some to wonder if the Messiah had arrived.
(Read Luke 3: 15.)
It is possible that some correctly understood a Messianic prophecy involving “seventy weeks. ”
If so, they could have determined when the Messiah would appear.
In part, the prophecy stated: “From the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Leader, there will be seven weeks, also sixty - two weeks. ”
Various scholars agree that these are weeks of years.
For instance, the Revised Standard Version says: “Seventy weeks of years are decreed. ”
Today, Jehovah’s servants are aware that the 69 weeks, or 483 years, of Daniel 9: 25 began in 455 B.C.E. when Persian King Artaxerxes authorized Nehemiah to restore and rebuild Jerusalem. Those weeks ended 483 years later, in 29 C.E., when Jesus of Nazareth was baptized and anointed with holy spirit, thus becoming the Messiah. ​ — Matt.
3: 13 - 17.
What prophecies will we now consider?
Let us now consider a few of many other prophecies regarding the Messiah that found fulfillment in Jesus ’ birth, early life, and ministry.
This will undoubtedly strengthen our faith in God’s prophetic word.
It will also provide clear evidence that Jesus was indeed the long - awaited Messiah.
His Early Life Foretold
Explain how Genesis 49: 10 was fulfilled.
The Messiah was to be born of Israel’s tribe of Judah.
In his deathbed blessing of his sons, the patriarch Jacob foretold: “The scepter will not turn aside from Judah, neither the commander’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to him the obedience of the peoples will belong. ”
Many Jewish scholars of the past associated those words with the Messiah.
Starting with the rule of Judean King David, the scepter (royal sovereignty) and the commander’s staff (power to command) resided with the tribe of Judah.
“Shiloh ” signifies“ He Whose It Is; He to Whom It Belongs. ”
The regal line of Judah would end in “Shiloh ” as the permanent kingly Heir, for God told Zedekiah, the last Judean king, that rulership would be given to one having the legal right to it.
After Zedekiah, Jesus was the only descendant of David to whom kingship was promised.
Before Jesus ’ birth, the angel Gabriel told Mary: “Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule as king over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end of his kingdom. ”
Shiloh must be Jesus Christ, who was a descendant of Judah and David. ​ — Matt.
1: 1 - 3, 6; Luke 3: 23, 31 - 34.
Where was the Messiah born, and why is this significant?
The Messiah’s birth would take place in Bethlehem.
“You, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, the one too little to get to be among the thousands of Judah, ” wrote the prophet Micah,“ from you there will come out to me the one who is to become ruler in Israel, whose origin is from early times, from the days of time indefinite. ”
The Messiah was to be born in the Judean town of Bethlehem, evidently once named Ephrathah.
Although Jesus ’ mother, Mary, and his adoptive father, Joseph, lived in Nazareth, a Roman registration decree had taken them to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born in 2 B.C.E.
What a remarkable fulfillment of prophecy!
8, 9.
What was foretold about the Messiah’s birth and the events that followed it?
The Messiah would be born of a virgin.
(Read Isaiah 7: 14.)
The Hebrew word bethu·lahʹ means “virgin, ” but another term (ʽal·mahʹ) appears at Isaiah 7: 14. There it was prophesied that“ the maiden [ha·ʽal·mahʹ] ” would give birth to a son.
The word ʽal·mahʹ is applied to the maiden Rebekah before her marriage.
Under inspiration, Matthew used the Greek word for “virgin ” (par·theʹnos) when showing that Isaiah 7: 14 was fulfilled in connection with the birth of Jesus.
The Gospel writers Matthew and Luke state that Mary was a virgin who became pregnant through the operation of God’s spirit. ​ — Matt. 1: 18 - 25; Luke 1: 26 - 35.
Young children would be killed after the Messiah’s birth.
Something similar happened centuries earlier when Egypt’s Pharaoh decreed that Hebrew male babies be cast into the Nile River.
But especially noteworthy is Jeremiah 31: 15, 16, where Rachel is depicted as weeping over her sons who were taken to “the land of the enemy. ”
Her lamentation was heard in distant Ramah, in the territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem.
Matthew shows that Jeremiah’s words were fulfilled when King Herod ordered the slaughter of young male children in Bethlehem and its surrounding territory.
(Read Matthew 2: 16 - 18.)
Imagine the grief in that area!
Explain how Hosea 11: 1 was fulfilled in Jesus.
Like the Israelites, the Messiah would be called out of Egypt.
Before Herod’s death - dealing decree, an angel directed that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus go to Egypt.
There they remained “until the decease of Herod, for that to be fulfilled which was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet [Hosea], saying: ‘ Out of Egypt I called my son. ’ ”
Of course, Jesus himself could not have orchestrated any of the foretold events associated with his birth and early life.
The Messiah Goes Into Action!
How was the way prepared before Jehovah’s Anointed One?
The way was to be prepared before God’s Anointed One.
Malachi foretold that “Elijah the prophet ” would do this work, preparing the hearts of the people for the coming of the Messiah. (Read Malachi 4: 5, 6.)
Jesus himself identified this “Elijah ” as John the Baptizer.
And Mark pointed out that the ministry of John fulfilled the prophetic words of Isaiah.
Jesus did not arrange for John to do an Elijahlike work as His forerunner.
The activity of this foretold “Elijah ” was done in harmony with God’s will as a means of identifying the Messiah.
What commission helps to identify the Messiah?
A God - given commission helps to identify the Messiah.
In the synagogue at Nazareth, the town where he had been reared, Jesus read from the scroll of Isaiah and applied to himself the words: “Jehovah’s spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor, he sent me forth to preach a release to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away with a release, to preach Jehovah’s acceptable year. ”
Because he truly was the Messiah, Jesus could rightly say: “Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled. ” ​ — Luke 4: 16 - 21.
How was Jesus ’ public ministry in Galilee foretold?
The Messiah’s public ministry in Galilee was foretold.
Concerning “the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali...
Galilee of the nations, ” Isaiah wrote: “The people that were walking in the darkness have seen a great light.
As for those dwelling in the land of deep shadow, light itself has shone upon them. ”
Jesus began his public ministry in Galilee, residing at Capernaum, where many residents of Zebulun and Naphtali enjoyed the benefits of the spiritual light he brought them.
In Galilee, Jesus gave his thought - provoking Sermon on the Mount, chose his apostles, performed his first miracle, and likely appeared to some 500 disciples after his resurrection.
He thus fulfilled Isaiah’s prophecy by preaching in “the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali. ”
Of course, Jesus went on to preach the Kingdom message elsewhere in Israel.
The Messiah’s Other Activities Foretold
In what way was Psalm 78: 2 fulfilled by Jesus?
The Messiah would speak in parables, or illustrations.
The psalmist Asaph sang: “In a proverbial saying I will open my mouth. ”
How do we know that this prophetically applied to Jesus?
Matthew tells us so. After relating illustrations in which Jesus likened the Kingdom to a developing mustard grain and to leaven, Matthew states: “Without an illustration [Jesus] would not speak to them; that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet who said: ‘ I will open my mouth with illustrations, I will publish things hidden since the founding. ’ ”
Proverbial sayings, or parables, were among Jesus ’ effective means of teaching.
Point out how Isaiah 53: 4 found fulfillment.
Our infirmities were to be borne by the Messiah.
Isaiah foretold: “Truly our sicknesses were what he himself carried; and as for our pains, he bore them. ”
Matthew pointed out that after curing Peter’s mother - in - law, Jesus healed others so that “there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: ‘ He himself took our sicknesses and carried our diseases. ’ ”
And this is but one of many recorded instances when Jesus cured the ailing.
How did the apostle John show that Jesus fulfilled Isaiah 53: 1?
Despite all the good done by the Messiah, many people would not believe in him. (Read Isaiah 53: 1.)
Showing that this prophecy was fulfilled, the apostle John wrote: “Although [Jesus] had performed so many signs before them, they were not putting faith in him, so that the word of Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled which he said: ‘ Jehovah, who has put faith in the thing heard by us?
And as for the arm of Jehovah, to whom has it been revealed? ’ ”
Also, few put faith in the good news about Jesus, the Messiah, during the ministry of the apostle Paul. ​ — Rom.
10: 16, 17.
John made what application of Psalm 69: 4?
The Messiah would be hated without cause. The apostle John quotes Jesus as saying: “If I had not done among [the people] the works that no one else did, they would have no sin; but now they have both seen and hated me as well as my Father.
But it is that the word written in their Law may be fulfilled, ‘ They hated me without cause. ’ ”
Often the “Law ” means the whole body of Scripture.
The Gospel accounts prove that Jesus was hated, especially by the Jewish religious leaders.
Moreover, Christ said: “The world has no reason to hate you, but it hates me, because I bear witness concerning it that its works are wicked. ” ​ — John 7: 7.
What further examination should strengthen our conviction that Jesus is the Messiah?
Jesus ’ first - century followers were certain that Jesus was the Messiah, for he did indeed fulfill the Messianic prophecies found in the Hebrew Scriptures.
As we have seen, some of these underwent fulfillment during the early life and ministry of Jesus of Nazareth.
Additional Messianic prophecies will be examined in the next article.
Our prayerful reflection on them will surely strengthen our conviction that Jesus Christ truly is the Messiah who was appointed by our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
For a detailed discussion of the “seventy weeks, ” see chapter 11 of the book Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy!
How Would You Answer?
• What prophecies were fulfilled in connection with Jesus ’ birth?
• How was the way prepared before the Messiah?
• What prophetic words of Isaiah chapter 53 found fulfillment in Jesus?
They Found the Messiah!
“We have found the Messiah. ” ​ — JOHN 1: 41.
What led up to the statement: “We have found the Messiah ”?
JOHN THE BAPTIZER is standing with two of his disciples.
As Jesus approaches, John exclaims: “See, the Lamb of God! ”
Andrew and the other disciple promptly follow Jesus and spend the day with him.
Later, Andrew finds his brother, Simon Peter, and leads him to Jesus after making the dramatic announcement: “We have found the Messiah. ” ​ — John 1: 35 - 41.
How will we benefit from further examination of Messianic prophecies?
As time passes, Andrew, Peter, and others will have ample opportunity to delve into the Scriptures and will unreservedly declare that Jesus of Nazareth is the promised Messiah.
Our own faith in God’s Word and his Anointed One will be bolstered as we now continue our examination of Messianic prophecies.
“Look! Your King Is Coming ”
What prophecies were fulfilled by Jesus ’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem?
The Messiah would make a triumphal entry into Jerusalem.
Zechariah’s prophecy stated: “Be very joyful, O daughter of Zion.
Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem.
Your king himself comes to you. He is righteous, yes, saved; humble, and riding upon an ass, even upon a full - grown animal the son of a she - ass. ”
The psalmist wrote: “Blessed be the One coming in the name of Jehovah. ”
Jesus could not have manipulated the crowd’s actions.
However, in fulfillment of prophecy, that throng spontaneously cried out with boundless joy.
As you read the account, visualize the scene and hear the happy voices. ​ — Read Matthew 21: 4 - 9.
Explain what happened in fulfillment of Psalm 118: 22, 23.
Although many would reject Jesus despite his Messianic credentials, he is precious to God.
As foretold, Jesus ‘ was despised and considered to be of no account ’ by those who refused to believe the evidence.
However, God had inspired the psalmist to say: “The stone that the builders rejected has become the head of the corner.
This has come to be from Jehovah himself. ”
Jesus drew this passage to the attention of his religious opposers, and Peter said that it was fulfilled in Christ.
Jesus did become the “foundation cornerstone ” of the Christian congregation.
Rejected by godless men, he is “chosen, precious, with God. ” ​ — 1 Pet.
2: 4 - 6. Betrayed and Abandoned!
5, 6.
What was foretold and fulfilled regarding the Messiah’s betrayal?
It was foretold that the Messiah would be betrayed by a treacherous associate.
David prophesied: “The man at peace with me, in whom I trusted, who was eating my bread, has magnified his heel against me. ”
A person who ate bread with someone was thought to be his friend.
So the betrayal of Jesus by Judas Iscariot was treachery of the worst sort.
Jesus called attention to the fulfillment of David’s prophetic words when He referred to his betrayer and told his apostles: “I am not talking about all of you; I know the ones I have chosen.
But it is in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, ‘ He that used to feed on my bread has lifted up his heel against me. ’ ” ​ — John 13: 18.
The Messiah’s betrayer would receive 30 pieces of silver ​ — the price of a slave!
Drawing on Zechariah 11: 12, 13, Matthew showed that Jesus was betrayed for such a paltry sum.
In Matthew’s day, Jeremiah may have been placed first in a group of Bible books that included Zechariah. (Compare Luke 24: 44.)
Judas never spent his ill - gotten sum, for he threw the money into the temple and went off and committed suicide. ​ — Matt.
26: 14 - 16; 27: 3 - 10. How did Zechariah 13: 7 undergo fulfillment?
Even the Messiah’s disciples would scatter.
“Strike the shepherd, ” wrote Zechariah,“ and let those of the flock be scattered. ”
On Nisan 14, 33 C.E., Jesus told his disciples: “All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night, for it is written, ‘ I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about. ’ ”
And that is exactly what happened, for Matthew reported that “all the disciples abandoned [Jesus] and fled. ” ​ — Matt.
26: 31, 56. Accused and Smitten Under what circumstances was Isaiah 53: 8 fulfilled?
The Messiah would be tried and condemned.
(Read Isaiah 53: 8.)
At dawn on Nisan 14, the entire Sanhedrin met, had Jesus bound, and handed him over to Roman Governor Pontius Pilate.
He questioned Jesus and found him guilty of nothing at all.
When Pilate offered to release Jesus, however, the crowd shouted: “Impale him! ”
and called for the freeing of the criminal Barabbas.
Wishing to satisfy the throng, Pilate released Barabbas, had Jesus whipped, and handed him over to be impaled. ​ — Mark 15: 1 - 15.
What happened in Jesus ’ time as was foretold at Psalm 35: 11?
False witnesses would testify against the Messiah.
“Violent witnesses rise up, ” said the psalmist David.
“What I have not known they ask me. ”
True to prophecy, “the chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus in order to put him to death. ”
In fact, “many, indeed, were giving false witness against him, but their testimonies were not in agreement. ”
Lying testimony mattered little to Jesus ’ rabid enemies, who sought his death.
Explain how Isaiah 53: 7 was fulfilled.
He was being brought just like a sheep to the slaughtering; and like a ewe that before her shearers has become mute, he also would not open his mouth. ”
While Jesus “was being accused by the chief priests and older men, he made no answer. ”
Pilate asked: “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you? ”
Nevertheless, Jesus “did not answer him, no, not a word, so that the governor wondered very much. ”
2: 23. What took place in fulfillment of Isaiah 50: 6 and Micah 5: 1?
Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah would be smitten.
“My back I gave to the strikers, and my cheeks to those plucking off the hair, ” wrote the prophet.“ My face I did not conceal from humiliating things and spit. ”
Micah foretold: “With the rod they will strike upon the cheek the judge of Israel. ”
Confirming the fulfillment of these prophecies, the Gospel writer Mark said: “Some started to spit on [Jesus] and to cover his whole face and hit him with their fists and say to him: ‘ Prophesy! ’
And, slapping him in the face, the court attendants took him. ”
Mark states that soldiers “would hit him on the head with a reed and spit upon him and, bending their knees [in mockery], they would do obeisance to him. ”
Of course, Jesus did nothing to provoke such abuse.
Faithful to Death
How did Psalm 22: 16 and Isaiah 53: 12 apply to Jesus?
Aspects of the Messiah’s impalement were foretold.
“The assembly of evildoers themselves have enclosed me, ” said the psalmist David.
“Like a lion they are at my hands and my feet. ”
Reporting an event well - known to Bible readers, the Gospel writer Mark states: “It was now the third hour [about nine o’clock in the morning], and they impaled him. ”
It had also been foretold that the Messiah would be numbered with sinners.
“He poured out his soul to the very death, ” wrote Isaiah,“ and it was with the transgressors that he was counted in. ”
So it was that “two robbers were impaled with [Jesus], one on his right and one on his left. ” ​ — Matt.
27: 38. In what way was Psalm 22: 7, 8 fulfilled in Jesus?
David prophesied that the Messiah would be reviled. (Read Psalm 22: 7, 8.)
Jesus was reviled while suffering on the torture stake, for Matthew reports: “The passersby began speaking abusively of him, wagging their heads and saying: ‘ O you would - be thrower - down of the temple and builder of it in three days, save yourself!
If you are a son of God, come down off the torture stake! ’ ”
Similarly, the chief priests, scribes, and older men made fun of him and said: “Others he saved; himself he cannot save!
He is King of Israel; let him now come down off the torture stake and we will believe on him.
He has put his trust in God; let Him now rescue him if He wants him, for he said, ‘ I am God’s Son. ’ ”
Yet, Jesus bore all of this with dignity.
What a fine example for us!
14, 15.
Show how specific prophecies were fulfilled regarding the Messiah’s clothing and his being given vinegar.
Lots were to be cast for the Messiah’s clothing.
“They apportion my garments among themselves, ” wrote the psalmist,“ and upon my clothing they cast lots. ”
That is what occurred, for “when [the Roman soldiers] had impaled [Jesus] they distributed his outer garments by casting lots. ” ​ — Matt. 27: 35; read John 19: 23, 24.
The Messiah would be given vinegar and gall.
“For food they gave me a poisonous plant, ” said the psalmist,“ and for my thirst they tried to make me drink vinegar. ”
Matthew tells us: “They gave [Jesus] wine mixed with gall to drink; but, after tasting it, he refused to drink. ”
Later, “one of them ran and took a sponge and soaked it with sour wine and put it on a reed and went giving him a drink. ” ​ — Matt. 27: 34, 48.
Explain how the prophetic words of Psalm 22: 1 were fulfilled.
The Messiah would seem forsaken by God. (Read Psalm 22: 1.)
In accord with prophecy, “at the ninth hour [about three o’clock in the afternoon] Jesus called out with a loud voice: ‘ Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? ’
which means, when translated: ‘ My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? ’ ”
Jesus had not lost faith in his heavenly Father.
God abandoned Jesus to his enemies by taking away His protection so that Christ’s integrity might be fully tested.
And by crying out as he did, Jesus fulfilled Psalm 22: 1.
How were Zechariah 12: 10 and Psalm 34: 20 fulfilled?
The Messiah would be pierced, but his bones would not be broken.
Inhabitants of Jerusalem would “look to the One whom they pierced through. ”
And Psalm 34: 20 states: “[God] is guarding all the bones of that one; not one of them has been broken. ”
Confirming these points, the apostle John wrote: “One of the soldiers jabbed his [Jesus ’] side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
And he that has seen it [John] has borne witness, and his witness is true...
These things took place in order for the scripture to be fulfilled: ‘ Not a bone of his will be crushed. ’
And, again, a different scripture says: ‘ They will look to the One whom they pierced. ’ ” ​ — John 19: 33 - 37.
How did Jesus come to be buried with the rich? The Messiah would be buried with the rich.
(Read Isaiah 53: 5, 8, 9.)
Late in the afternoon of Nisan 14, “a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, ” asked Pilate for Jesus ’ body, and the request was granted.
Matthew’s account adds: “Joseph took the body, wrapped it up in clean fine linen, and laid it in his new memorial tomb, which he had quarried in the rock - mass.
And, after rolling a big stone to the door of the memorial tomb, he left. ” ​ — Matt. 27: 57 - 60.
Hail the Messianic King!
What happened in keeping with the prophetic words of Psalm 16: 10?
The Messiah would be resurrected.
David wrote: “You [Jehovah] will not leave my soul in Sheol. ” Imagine the surprise of the women who came to the tomb where Jesus ’ body had been laid.
There they encountered a materialized angel, who told them: “Stop being stunned.
You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was impaled.
He was raised up, he is not here. See!
The place where they laid him. ”
To the crowd present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E., the apostle Peter declared: “[David] saw beforehand and spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he forsaken in Hades nor did his flesh see corruption. ”
God did not allow the physical body of his beloved Son to decay.
Moreover, Jesus was miraculously raised to life in the spirit! ​ — 1 Pet.
3: 18.
How was the foretold rulership of the Messiah fulfilled?
As foretold, God declared that Jesus is his Son.
(Read Psalm 2: 7; Matthew 3: 17.)
Christ will soon destroy his foes as he ‘ rides in the cause of truth, humility, and righteousness. ’
His kingship will then bring about earth - wide peace and prosperity.
How privileged we are to proclaim these truths as Witnesses of Jehovah, whose beloved Son already reigns in heaven as the Messianic King!

Questions From Readers
Is it possible to say exactly how many Messianic prophecies are contained in the Hebrew Scriptures?
A careful study of the Hebrew Scriptures enables us to identify dozens of prophecies that were fulfilled in Jesus Christ.
These prophecies foretold details of the Messiah’s background, time of appearance, actions, treatment, and place in Jehovah God’s arrangement.
They combine to form one grand picture that helps us to identify Jesus as the Messiah.
However, caution is needed if we try to determine exactly how many Messianic prophecies are found in the Hebrew Scriptures.
Not everyone agrees on what is or is not a Messianic prophecy.
In his book The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, Alfred Edersheim stated that the ancient rabbinic writings classified 456 passages from the Hebrew Scriptures as Messianic, although many of them do not specifically mention the Messiah.
A close look at these 456 passages raises questions as to whether some of them are prophetic of Jesus Christ.
For example, Edersheim said that the Jews regarded Genesis 8: 11 as Messianic.
They held that “the olive - leaf, brought by the dove, was taken from the Mount of the Messiah. ”
The author also mentioned Exodus 12: 42. Explaining how the Jews incorrectly understood this text, he wrote: “As Moses came out of the desert, so would the Messiah come out of Rome. ”
Many scholars and others would undoubtedly find it hard to relate these two texts and erroneous explanations to Jesus Christ.
Take, for example, Isaiah chapter 53, which contains several prophetic features regarding the Messiah.
Isaiah 53: 2 - 7 prophesies: “No stately form does he have...
He was despised and was avoided by men...
Our sicknesses were what he himself carried...
He was being pierced for our transgression...
He was being brought just like a sheep to the slaughtering. ”
Should this whole passage in Isaiah chapter 53 be counted as one Messianic prophecy, or should each of these characteristics of the Messiah be viewed as a separate prophecy in its own right?
Consider, too, Isaiah 11: 1, which reads: “There must go forth a twig out of the stump of Jesse; and out of his roots a sprout will be fruitful. ” In verse 10, this prophecy appears again, with similar wording.
Should we count these two verses as two separate prophecies or as one prophecy that is repeated?
The conclusions reached on Isaiah chapter 53 and Isaiah chapter 11 would clearly affect the total number of Messianic prophecies.
Hence, we do well to avoid being specific about the total number of Messianic prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures.
Jehovah’s organization has published lists showing dozens of prophecies concerning Jesus and their fulfillment.
* These lists can be of assistance and encouragement to us in our personal and family study and in our public ministry.
Moreover, the numerous Messianic prophecies, whatever their number, give us solid evidence that Jesus is the Christ, or Messiah.

A History - Making Meeting
“BY THE time this meeting is over, you will say, ‘ This was truly a theocratic history - making annual meeting! ’ ”
With those words, Stephen Lett of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses intensified the sense of keen anticipation in the large audience.
They were gathered for the 126th annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, held on October 2, 2010, at the Assembly Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Jersey City, New Jersey, U.S.A.
What were some of the highlights of this historic occasion?
Brother Lett’s opening talk was an enthusiastic discussion of Jehovah’s celestial chariot as described in the Bible book of Ezekiel.
This colossal, glorious vehicle pictures God’s organization, with Jehovah in complete control.
Its heavenly part, composed of spirit creatures, moves with lightning speed ​ — the speed of Jehovah’s own thoughts, Brother Lett said.
The earthly part of Jehovah God’s organization is likewise on the move.
Brother Lett noted a number of exciting developments in the visible part of God’s organization in recent years.
For instance, a number of branches are being merged and consolidated, which will allow many who were formerly serving in Bethel homes in those countries to focus on the preaching work.
Brother Lett urged the audience to keep praying that the Governing Body, as the representative of the slave class, continue to be not only faithful but also wise, or discreet. ​ — Matt.
24: 45 - 47.
Tab Honsberger, who serves on the Branch Committee in Haiti, gave a touching report on the aftermath of the January 12, 2010, earthquake, which took an estimated 300,000 lives in that land.
He noted that clergymen have been telling people that God punished those victims for being faithless while protecting the good.
Yet, thousands of convicted criminals went free when the walls of a prison collapsed in the quake.
Many honesthearted Haitians are thus finding comfort in learning the truth about why our times are so troubled.
Brother Honsberger quoted a faithful Haitian brother who lost his wife in the disaster as saying: “I shed tears to this day.
I don’t know how long I will continue to mourn, but I rejoice to feel the love of Jehovah’s organization.
I have hope, and I am determined to share it. ”
Mark Sanderson, now a member of the Brooklyn Bethel family, gave a report on the Philippines.
A former member of the Branch Committee there, he fairly beamed as he spoke of the country’s 32 consecutive peaks in the number of Kingdom publishers and of the way the Bible studies far outnumber the publishers.
He told of a brother named Miguel whose grandson was murdered.
Miguel worked hard to have the murderer prosecuted and jailed.
Later, when witnessing in the prison, Miguel met the murderer.
Though nervous, Miguel addressed him mildly and kindly.
He eventually studied with the man, who responded well and came to love Jehovah. He is now baptized.
Miguel is his close friend and is working to win his new brother an early release from prison.
The program next featured a get - acquainted interview conducted by Mark Noumair, an instructor in the Theocratic Schools Department. He interviewed three couples ​ — Alex and Sarah Reinmueller, David and Krista Schafer, and Robert and Ketra Ciranko.
Alex Reinmueller, a helper to the Publishing Committee, told of how he made the truth his own while pioneering in Canada when he was only 15 years old, often working by himself.
Asked who had the most impact on him at Bethel, Brother Reinmueller mentioned three faithful men, pointing out how each of them had helped him to grow spiritually.
His wife, Sarah, told of her friendship with a sister who endured decades in Chinese prisons for her faith.
Sarah said that she has learned to rely on Jehovah through personal prayer.
David Schafer, a helper to the Teaching Committee, praised his mother for her strong faith and told of brothers who worked as loggers and helped him to auxiliary pioneer as a youth.
His wife, Krista, spoke fondly of being influenced by older members of the Bethel family who proved to be “faithful in what is least, ” as Jesus recommended. ​ — Luke 16: 10.
Robert Ciranko, a helper to the Writing Committee, reminisced about his four grandparents, who were Hungarian immigrants and anointed Christians.
As a boy, he was impressed when he attended large conventions in the 1950 ’ s and learned that Jehovah’s organization was far bigger than his own congregation.
His wife, Ketra, told of how she learned about loyalty when serving as a pioneer in a congregation that was afflicted with apostasy and other problems.
She endured and was eventually assigned to serve as a special pioneer in a congregation where the unity touched her heart.
Manfred Tonak next gave a report, on Ethiopia. This land dates back to Bible times, and it is now blessed with over 9,000 publishers of the good news.
Most of them live in or near the capital, Addis Ababa.
Remote areas thus need more attention.
To address this need, Ethiopian Witnesses living in other countries were invited to visit in order to preach in some remote parts of the country.
Many came, encouraged the local Witnesses, and found receptive listeners.
A program highlight was a symposium about Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia and their legal struggles.
Aulis Bergdahl of the Branch Committee in Russia presented a history of the persecution of the Witnesses in Russia, particularly in Moscow.
Philip Brumley of the Legal Department at the United States branch told about the thrilling developments in recent months when the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) heard the nine charges that had been leveled against the Witnesses.
The Court unanimously found that none of the nine charges had any merit, in a number of cases even reasoning carefully to refute the arguments presented.
While the results remain to be seen, Brother Brumley spoke hopefully of the impact that the Court’s ruling may have on cases in other lands.
Following this exciting news, Brother Lett announced that the ECHR had deemed as admissible the long - running tax case involving the government of France and Jehovah’s Witnesses.
This highly respected Court admits very few of the cases presented to it.
So far, the ECHR has considered a total of 39 cases involving Jehovah’s Witnesses, and it has ruled in our favor in 37 of them.
Brother Lett encouraged all of God’s people to keep the current matter before Jehovah God in prayer.
The final report came from Richard Morlan, a field instructor of the School for Congregation Elders.
He spoke enthusiastically about the school and the appreciative response from the elders who have attended.
Guy Pierce of the Governing Body gave a heartfelt talk that focused on the yeartext for 2011, “Take refuge in the name of Jehovah. ”
He noted that while this is a happy time in many ways for Jehovah’s people, it is also a serious, sobering time.
Jehovah’s great day is near; yet, people continue to seek refuge in false religion, political institutions, material wealth, escapism, and the like.
To find a genuine refuge, we need to call upon Jehovah’s name, which involves knowing, deeply respecting, and trusting the Person represented by that name, loving him with everything we have.
David Splane of the Governing Body next delivered an earnest, thought - provoking discussion on the theme “Have You Entered Into God’s Rest? ”
He noted that God’s rest does not mean inactivity, since Jehovah and his Son have “kept working ” throughout that figurative day of rest in order to bring God’s purpose for the things created regarding the earth to a successful conclusion.
How, then, may we enter into God’s rest?
Desisting from sin and from works of self - justification are just part of the answer.
We need to exercise faith and live with God’s purpose in mind, making whatever contribution we can to that purpose.
At times, that may be a special challenge, but we need to accept the counsel and cooperate with the direction from Jehovah’s organization.
Brother Splane entreated the audience to do everything possible to enter into God’s rest.
The final talk, delivered by Anthony Morris of the Governing Body, was entitled “What Are We Waiting For? ”
With urgency and fatherly warmth, Brother Morris reminded the audience of prophetic developments yet ahead of us, events that all faithful ones eagerly await. These include the cry of “Peace and security! ” and the destruction of false religion.
Brother Morris warned against saying, “This must be Armageddon, ” in response to events in the news that do not fulfill such prophecies.
He recommended the joyful, patient, waiting attitude described at Micah 7: 7.
At the same time, though, he urged all to “close ranks ” with the Governing Body, to draw close together as would soldiers entering the thick of the battle.
“May your heart be strong, ” he said,“ all you who are waiting for Jehovah. ” ​ — Ps.
31: 24.
In conclusion, there were some thrilling, history - making announcements.
Geoffrey Jackson of the Governing Body announced plans for the trial of a simplified study edition of The Watchtower for those with limited English - reading abilities.
Then Stephen Lett announced that the Governing Body will arrange for shepherding visits to be provided for district overseers and their wives in the United States.
He next revealed that the Ministerial Training School would henceforth be known as the Bible School for Single Brothers.
It would soon be complemented by the Bible School for Christian Couples.
This school would give couples further training so that they can be more useful to Jehovah’s organization.
A touching conclusion to the program came when 97 - year - old John E.
Barr, longtime member of the Governing Body, offered a humble and sincere prayer.
* Everyone left with the impression that this had indeed been a historic day.
See the 2011 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses, pages 62 - 63.
Brother Barr finished his earthly course on December 4, 2010.

Questions From Readers
How are we to understand the figures in the annual service report?
Each year, we look forward to the service report published in the Yearbook.
It is thrilling to see what Jehovah’s people as a group have accomplished in the worldwide Kingdom preaching and teaching work.
But to derive the greatest benefit from the report, we need a correct understanding of the entries as well as a balanced view of the figures.
Consider a few examples.
Service year.
This extends from September of one year through August of the next.
The Yearbook contains the report for the preceding service year.
Thus, the 2011 Yearbook contains the report for the 2010 service year, which ran from September 1, 2009, to August 31, 2010.
“Publishers ” includes baptized Witnesses of Jehovah as well as unbaptized ones who qualify to be Kingdom preachers.
“Peak publishers ” is the highest number reporting for any one month of the service year and may include late reports that were not added to the preceding month’s report.
In this way some publishers may be counted twice.
However, the peak figure does not include the number of publishers who actually shared in the ministry but forgot to report.
This emphasizes the importance of each publisher reporting promptly each month.
“Average publishers ” is the typical number of different ones reporting time in the ministry each month.
Total hours.
According to the 2011 Yearbook, Jehovah’s Witnesses spent over 1.6 billion hours in the field ministry.
This total, however, does not represent all the hours we spend in our worship, for it does not include time we regularly devote to such activities as shepherding, attending meetings, and engaging in personal Bible study and meditation.
During the 2010 service year, Jehovah’s Witnesses spent over $155 million in caring for special pioneers, missionaries, and traveling overseers in their field service assignments.
This figure does not, however, include the cost of printing the Bible - based publications we produce; nor does it include the money spent in caring for the more than 20,000 Bethel volunteers staffing the branch facilities around the world.
Memorial partakers.
This is the number of baptized individuals who partake of the emblems at the Memorial worldwide.
Does this total represent the number of anointed ones on earth?
A number of factors ​ — including past religious beliefs or even mental or emotional imbalance — ​ might cause some to assume mistakenly that they have the heavenly calling.
We thus have no way of knowing the exact number of anointed ones on earth; nor do we need to know.
The Governing Body does not keep a list of all partakers, for it does not maintain a global network of anointed ones.
What we do know is that there will be some of the anointed “slaves of our God ” on earth when the destructive winds of the great tribulation are released.
Until then, the anointed will take the lead in something that is well - documented by our annual service report ​ — the greatest preaching and teaching work in human history.
See the article “The Faithful Steward and Its Governing Body, ” in the June 15, 2009, issue of The Watchtower, page 24.
Jehovah ​ — “The God Who Gives Peace ”
“May the God who gives peace be with all of you. ” ​ — ROM. 15: 33.
1, 2.
What tense situation is described in Genesis chapters 32 and 33, and what was the outcome?
Esau has heard that his twin brother, Jacob, is returning home.
Even though 20 years have passed since Esau sold his right as firstborn to his brother, Jacob fears that his brother may still harbor a murderous grudge against him.
Accompanied by 400 men, Esau marches toward his estranged brother.
Anticipating a hostile reception, Jacob sends Esau wave upon wave of gifts amounting to over 550 domestic animals.
With each group of animals, Jacob’s servants tell Esau that they are a gift from his brother.
As Jacob courageously walks toward Esau, he bows down ​ — not once but seven times.
Jacob has already taken the most important measure he can take to soften the heart of his brother.
Jacob has prayed to Jehovah for deliverance from Esau’s hand. Does Jehovah answer this prayer?
Yes. “Esau went running to meet him, ” the Bible tells us,“ and he began to embrace him and fall upon his neck and kiss him. ” ​ — Gen.
32: 11 - 20; 33: 1 - 4.
What do we learn from the account of Jacob and Esau?
The account of Jacob and Esau shows that we should make earnest and practical efforts to settle matters when problems arise that may threaten the peace we enjoy within the Christian congregation.
Jacob sought to make peace with Esau, but not because Jacob had erred against his brother and owed him an apology.
No, Esau had despised his birthright and had sold it to Jacob for a bowl of stew.
However, the way Jacob approached Esau illustrates the extent to which we should be willing to go to preserve the peace with our Christian brothers.
It also shows that the true God blesses our prayerful efforts to make peace.
The Bible contains numerous other examples that instruct us to be peacemakers.
A Superlative Example to Exhort Us
What is God’s provision for saving mankind from sin and death?
The most outstanding example of a peacemaker is Jehovah ​ — “the God who gives peace. ”
Think of the extent to which Jehovah went to enable us to have a peaceful relationship with him.
As sinful descendants of Adam and Eve, we deserve “the wages [that] sin pays. ”
Still, out of his great love, Jehovah arranged for our salvation by sending his beloved Son from heaven to be born as a perfect human.
And the Son willingly complied.
He allowed himself to be put to death by God’s enemies.
The true God resurrected his beloved Son, who afterward presented to the Father the value of his shed blood, which would be a ransom to save repentant sinners from eternal death. ​ — Read Hebrews 9: 14, 24.
5, 6.
How does Jesus ’ shed blood affect the damaged relationship between God and sinful mankind?
How does the provision of the ransom sacrifice of God’s Son affect the damaged relationship between God and sinful mankind? “The chastisement meant for our peace was upon him, ” states Isaiah 53: 5,“ and because of his wounds there has been a healing for us. ”
Instead of being viewed as God’s enemies, obedient humans can now enjoy a peaceful relationship with him. “By means of [Jesus] we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one, yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses. ” ​ — Eph.
1: 7. The Bible states: “God saw good for all fullness to dwell in [Christ]. ”
This is because Christ is the key figure in the fulfilling of God’s purpose.
And what is Jehovah’s purpose?
It is “to reconcile again to himself all other things by making peace through the [shed] blood ” of Jesus Christ.
“All other things ” that God thus brings into a peaceful relationship with him are“ the things in the heavens ” and “the things upon the earth. ”
What are they? ​ — Read Colossians 1: 19, 20.
What are “the things in the heavens ” and“ the things upon the earth ” that are brought into a peaceful relationship with God?
The provision of the ransom makes it possible for anointed Christians, who “have been declared righteous ” as sons of God, to“ enjoy peace with God. ”
(Read Romans 5: 1.)
They are referred to as “the things in the heavens ” because they have a heavenly hope and“ are to rule as kings over the earth ” and serve as priests to God.
On the other hand, “the things upon the earth ” refer to repentant humans, who will eventually attain to everlasting life on earth. ​ — Ps.
37: 29.
How are you affected by reflecting on the extent to which Jehovah went to enable mankind to be at peace with him?
Expressing his heartfelt gratitude for Jehovah’s provision, Paul wrote to the anointed Christians in Ephesus: “God, who is rich in mercy,... made us alive together with the Christ, even when we were dead in trespasses ​ — by undeserved kindness you have been saved. ”
Whether we have a heavenly hope or an earthly hope, we are deeply indebted to God for his mercy and undeserved kindness.
Our hearts are filled with gratitude as we consider the extent to which Jehovah went to make it possible for mankind to enjoy peace with him.
When we are confronted with situations that threaten the peaceful unity of the congregation, should not our appreciatively reflecting on God’s example move us to be peacemakers?
Learning From the Ways of Abraham and Isaac
9, 10.
How did Abraham prove himself to be a peacemaker in dealing with Lot when tension arose among their herdsmen?
Concerning the patriarch Abraham, the Bible states: “‘ Abraham put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness, ’ and he came to be called ‘ Jehovah’s friend. ’ ”
Abraham’s faith was made evident by his peace - loving ways.
For example, as Abraham’s flocks and herds increased, tension developed between his herdsmen and those of his nephew Lot.
The obvious solution was that Abraham and Lot separate.
How would Abraham deal with this delicate situation?
Instead of using his age and status with God to tell his nephew what to do, Abraham proved himself to be a true peacemaker.
“Please, do not let any quarreling continue between me and you and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, ” Abraham told his nephew,“ for we men are brothers. ”
The patriarch continued: “Is not the whole land available to you?
Please, separate from me.
If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; but if you go to the right, then I will go to the left. ”
Lot chose the most fertile part of the land, but Abraham held no grudge against him.
Later on when Lot was taken captive by invading armies, Abraham did not hesitate to rescue his nephew. ​ — Gen.
14: 14 - 16.
How did Abraham pursue peace with his Philistine neighbors?
Think also of how Abraham pursued peace with his Philistine neighbors in the land of Canaan.
The Philistines had “seized by violence ” a well of water dug by Abraham’s servants at Beer - sheba.
How would a man who had rescued his nephew by overcoming the four kings who had captured him respond to this act?
Rather than fight back and repossess his well, Abraham chose to remain silent about the matter.
In time, the Philistine king visited Abraham to make a covenant of peace.
Only after he got Abraham to swear to him to be kind to the Philistine king’s offspring did Abraham bring up the matter of his stolen well.
Shocked to hear about this, the king restored the well to Abraham.
As for Abraham, he continued to live peacefully as an alien resident in the land. ​ — Gen.
21: 22 - 31, 34.
12, 13. (a) How did Isaac follow the example of his father?
(b) How did Jehovah bless Isaac’s peace - loving ways?
Abraham’s son Isaac followed the peace - loving ways of his father.
This is evident from the manner in which Isaac dealt with the Philistines.
Because of a famine in the land, Isaac moved his household north, from Beer - lahai - roi in the arid region of the Negeb into the more fertile territory of the Philistines at Gerar.
There Jehovah blessed Isaac with bumper crops and increased his livestock.
The Philistines began to envy him.
Not wanting Isaac to prosper as his father had prospered, the Philistines stopped up the wells that Abraham’s servants had dug in the region.
Finally, the Philistine king told Isaac to ‘ move from their neighborhood. ’
The peaceful man Isaac complied. ​ — Gen.
24: 62; 26: 1, 12 - 17.
After Isaac moved his encampment farther away, his shepherds dug another well.
Philistine shepherds claimed that the water was theirs. Like his father, Abraham, Isaac did not fight over a well.
Instead, Isaac again had his men dig a well. The Philistines also claimed this one for themselves.
For the sake of peace, Isaac moved his large encampment away to yet another location.
There his servants dug a well that Isaac named Rehoboth.
In time, he moved to the more fertile region of Beer - sheba, where Jehovah blessed him and told him: “Do not be afraid, because I am with you, and I will bless you and multiply your seed on account of Abraham my servant. ” ​ — Gen.
26: 17 - 25.
How did Isaac prove himself to be a peacemaker when the Philistine king sought to make a covenant of peace with him?
Isaac surely had the ability to fight for his right to use all the wells that his servants had dug.
After all, the Philistine king and his officials came to visit him in Beer - sheba and sought to make a covenant of peace with him, saying: “We have unmistakably seen that Jehovah has proved to be with you. ”
Still, for the sake of peace, Isaac had more than once opted to move rather than fight.
This time too Isaac proved himself to be a peacemaker.
The historical record states: “He made a feast for [his visitors] and they ate and drank.
Next morning they were early in rising and they made sworn statements one to the other. After that Isaac sent them away... in peace. ” ​ — Gen.
26: 26 - 31.
Learning From the Son Whom Jacob Loved the Most
Isaac’s son Jacob grew up to be “a blameless man. ”
As discussed at the outset, Jacob sought to make peace with his brother, Esau.
Undoubtedly, Jacob had benefited from the peaceable example of his father, Isaac.
What can be said about Jacob’s sons?
Of his 12 sons, Joseph was the one whom Jacob loved the most.
Joseph was an obedient, respectful son who cared deeply for his father’s interests.
However, Joseph’s older brothers became so jealous of him that they were unable to speak peacefully to him.
Cruelly, they sold Joseph into slavery and tricked their father into believing that Joseph had been killed by a wild beast. ​ — Gen.
37: 4, 28, 31 - 33.
16, 17.
How did Joseph prove himself to be a peace - loving brother to his siblings?
Jehovah proved to be with Joseph.
In time, Joseph became Egypt’s prime minister ​ — second in power only to Pharaoh.
When a severe famine brought Joseph’s brothers to Egypt, they did not even recognize him in his official Egyptian attire.
How easy it would have been for Joseph to repay his brothers for their cruelty to him and to their father!
Rather than seek revenge, however, Joseph tried to make peace with them.
When it became clear that his brothers had repented, he made himself known to them, saying: “Do not feel hurt and do not be angry with yourselves because you sold me here; because for the preservation of life God has sent me ahead of you. ”
Then he proceeded to kiss all his brothers and to weep over them. ​ — Gen.
45: 1, 5, 15.
After the death of their father, Jacob, Joseph’s brothers thought that Joseph might take vengeance on them.
As they expressed their fears to him, Joseph “burst into tears ” and replied:“ Do not be afraid.
I myself shall keep supplying you and your little children with food. ”
Peace - loving Joseph “comforted them and spoke reassuringly to them. ” ​ — Gen.
50: 15 - 21.
“Written for Our Instruction ”
18, 19. (a) How have you benefited from considering the examples of peacemakers discussed in this article?
(b) What will we consider in the next article?
“All the things that were written aforetime were written for our instruction, ” wrote Paul,“ that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope. ”
How have we benefited from considering not only the superlative example of Jehovah but also the Scriptural accounts of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph?
Does not appreciatively reflecting on what Jehovah has done to heal the damaged relationship between him and sinful mankind move us to do all we can to pursue peace with others?
The examples of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph show that parents can have a good influence on their children.
Moreover, these accounts also show that Jehovah blesses the efforts of those who try to make peace.
No wonder Paul refers to Jehovah as “the God who gives peace ”!
(Read Romans 15: 33; 16: 20.)
The following article will consider why Paul stressed the need for us to pursue peace and how we can be peacemakers.
What Did You Learn?
• In what way did Jacob seek peace when he was about to meet Esau?
• How have you been affected by what Jehovah did to enable mankind to be at peace with him?
• What have you learned from the examples of the peacemakers Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph?
[Pictures on page 23]
What was the most important step taken by Jacob in making peace with Esau?
Pursue Peace
“Let us pursue the things making for peace. ” ​ — ROM. 14: 19.
1, 2.
Why do Jehovah’s Witnesses enjoy peace among themselves?
TRUE peace is hard to find in today’s world.
Even people belonging to the same national group and speaking the same language are often divided religiously, politically, and socially.
By contrast, Jehovah’s people are united despite the fact that they have come out of “all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues. ” ​ — Rev. 7: 9.
The peaceful condition that generally exists among us is no accident.
It has come about primarily because we “enjoy peace with God ” through our faith in his Son, whose shed blood covers our sins.
Moreover, the true God gives holy spirit to his loyal servants, and the fruitage of that spirit includes peace.
Another reason for our peaceful unity is that we are “no part of the world. ”
Rather than taking sides in political issues, we remain neutral.
Having ‘ beaten our swords into plowshares, ’ we do not get involved in civil or international wars. ​ — Isa.
2: 4.
What does the peace we can enjoy make possible, and what will be discussed in this article?
The peace we can enjoy with one another goes deeper than merely refraining from doing harm to our brothers.
Although the congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses that we belong to may be made up of individuals from many different ethnic groups and cultures, we “love one another. ”
Our peace allows us to “work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith. ”
Our peaceful spiritual paradise is something to be treasured and safeguarded.
Let us, therefore, examine how we may pursue peace within the congregation.
When We Stumble
What can we do to pursue peace when we have offended someone?
“We all stumble many times, ” wrote the disciple James.
“If anyone does not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man. ”
Hence, differences and misunderstandings between fellow believers are bound to arise.
However, problems between individuals can be solved without disturbing the peace of the congregation.
For example, consider the counsel we should apply if we realize that we may have offended someone. ​ — Read Matthew 5: 23, 24.
How may we pursue peace when we have been wronged?
What if we have been wronged in some small way?
“[Love] does not keep account of the injury, ” states 1 Corinthians 13: 5.
When offended, we pursue peace by forgiving and forgetting, that is, by ‘ not keeping account of the injury. ’
(Read Colossians 3: 13.)
Minor transgressions in day - to - day life are best handled in this way, for this contributes to a peaceful relationship with fellow worshippers and gives us peace of mind.
A wise proverb states: “It is beauty... to pass over transgression. ” ​ — Prov.
19: 11.
What should we do if it is too difficult for us to overlook an offense committed against us?
What if we find that a certain offense is too difficult for us to overlook?
Spreading the matter to as many ears as are willing to hear is certainly not the course of wisdom.
What should be done to resolve the matter peacefully?
Matthew 18: 15 states: “If your brother commits a sin, go lay bare his fault between you and him alone.
If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. ”
While Matthew 18: 15 - 17 applies to sin of a serious nature, in the spirit of the principle stated in verse 15, we should kindly approach the offender privately and try to restore a peaceful relationship with him.
Why should we be quick to settle disputes?
The apostle Paul wrote: “Be wrathful, and yet do not sin; let the sun not set with you in a provoked state, neither allow place for the Devil. ”“ Be about settling matters quickly with the one complaining against you at law, ” said Jesus.
Pursuing peace, then, calls for settling difficulties quickly. Why?
Because doing so prevents differences from festering like an untreated, infected wound.
Let us not allow pride, envy, or the attaching of too much importance to material things prevent us from resolving disputes soon after they arise. ​ — Jas. 4: 1 - 6.
When a Controversy Involves Many
8, 9. (a) What differences of viewpoint existed in the first - century congregation in Rome?
(b) What counsel did Paul give Roman Christians regarding their dispute?
Sometimes differences in the congregation involve not just two people but many individuals.
That was the case with Christians in Rome to whom the apostle Paul wrote an inspired letter.
There was a dispute among Jewish and Gentile Christians. Certain ones in that congregation were evidently looking down on those whose consciences were weak, or overly restrictive.
What advice did Paul give the congregation? ​ — Rom.
14: 1 - 6. Paul counseled individuals on both sides of the dispute.
He told those who understood that they were not under the Mosaic Law not to look down on their brothers.
Such an attitude could stumble believers who still found it repulsive to eat things that were not permitted under the Law.
“Stop tearing down the work of God just for the sake of food, ” Paul admonished them.
“It is well not to eat flesh or to drink wine or do anything over which your brother stumbles. ”
On the other hand, Paul counseled Christians who had more restrictive consciences not to be judging as unfaithful those who held a broader viewpoint.
He told ‘ everyone there among them not to think more of himself than it was necessary to think. ’
Having counseled both sides in this dispute, Paul wrote: “So, then, let us pursue the things making for peace and the things that are upbuilding to one another. ” ​ — Rom. 14: 19.
As with the first - century congregation in Rome, what is needed to resolve differences today?
We can be sure that the congregation in Rome responded well to Paul’s counsel and made the necessary adjustments.
When differences among fellow Christians occur today, should we not likewise settle disputes graciously by humbly seeking and applying Scriptural counsel?
As was the case with the Romans, today those on both sides of the controversy may need to make adjustments in order to “keep peace between one another. ” ​ — Mark 9: 50.
When Called Upon to Help
What care should an elder exercise if a Christian wants to talk to him about a dispute with a fellow believer?
What if a Christian wants to talk to an elder about a problem he or she is having with a relative or with a fellow believer?
Proverbs 21: 13 states: “Anyone stopping up his ear from the complaining cry of the lowly one, he himself also will call and not be answered. ”
An elder would certainly not ‘ stop up his ear. ’
However, another proverb warns: “The first to state his case seems right, until his opponent begins to cross - examine him. ”
An elder should listen kindly, but he needs to be careful not to take sides with the one reporting the offense.
After listening to the matter, he would likely ask whether the offended party has spoken to the one who caused the upset.
The elder may also review Scriptural steps that the offended one can take to pursue peace.
Cite examples showing the danger of acting hastily after hearing a complaint.
Three Biblical examples underscore the danger of acting hastily after hearing only one side of a controversy.
Potiphar believed his wife’s story that Joseph had tried to rape her.
With unjustified anger, Potiphar had Joseph thrown into prison.
King David believed Ziba, who said that his master, Mephibosheth, had sided with David’s enemies.
Yours is everything that belongs to Mephibosheth ” was David’s hasty response.
King Artaxerxes was told that the Jews were rebuilding Jerusalem’s walls and were about to rebel against the Persian Empire.
The king believed the false report and ordered that all rebuilding in Jerusalem cease.
As a result, the Jews stopped work on God’s temple.
Christian elders wisely follow Paul’s counsel to Timothy to avoid making premature judgments. ​ — Read 1 Timothy 5: 21.
13, 14. (a) All of us have what limitations respecting the disputes of others?
(b) What help do elders have in making correct judgments respecting fellow believers?
Even when it seems that both sides of a dispute have come to light, it is important to realize that “if anyone thinks he has acquired knowledge of something, he does not yet know it just as he ought to know it. ”
Do we really know all the details that led up to the dispute?
Can we fully understand the backgrounds of the individuals involved?
When called upon to judge, how vital it is that elders not let themselves be deceived by falsehood, clever tactics, or rumors!
God’s appointed Judge, Jesus Christ, judges righteously.
He does not “judge by any mere appearance to his eyes, nor reprove simply according to the thing heard by his ears. ”
Rather, Jesus is guided by Jehovah’s spirit.
Christian elders likewise have the benefit of being guided by God’s holy spirit.
Before they make judgments respecting fellow believers, elders need to pray for the help of Jehovah’s spirit and depend on its guidance by consulting God’s Word and the publications of the faithful and discreet slave class. ​ — Matt.
24: 45. Peace at Any Price?
As Christians, we are exhorted to pursue peace.
However, the Bible also states: “The wisdom from above is first of all chaste, then peaceable. ”
If a Christian becomes aware of a serious sin on the part of a fellow believer, he should encourage that one to confess the sin to the elders.
If the wrongdoer does not do so, the Christian who has come to know about the sin should report it.
Failure to do this in a mistaken effort to maintain peace with the sinner makes one a party to the wrongdoing. ​ — Lev. 5: 1; read Proverbs 29: 24.
What can we learn from Jehu’s encounter with King Jehoram?
One account involving Jehu shows that God’s righteousness takes priority over peaceableness.
God sent Jehu to execute His judgment on the house of King Ahab.
Wicked King Jehoram, the son of Ahab and Jezebel, rode in his chariot to meet Jehu and said: “Is there peace, Jehu? ”
How did Jehu respond?
He replied: “What peace could there be as long as there are the fornications of Jezebel your mother and her many sorceries? ”
With that, Jehu drew his bow and shot Jehoram through the heart.
Just as Jehu took action, elders must not compromise with willful, unrepentant practicers of sin for the sake of keeping peace.
They expel unrepentant sinners so that the congregation can continue to enjoy peace with God. ​ — 1 Cor.
5: 1, 2, 11 - 13. All Christians play what part in pursuing peace?
Most disputes between brothers do not involve serious wrongdoing that requires judicial action.
How good it is, therefore, lovingly to cover over the mistakes of others.
“The one covering over transgression is seeking love, ” says God’s Word,“ and he that keeps talking about a matter is separating those familiar with one another. ”
Complying with those words will help all of us to preserve peace in the congregation and maintain a good relationship with Jehovah. ​ — Matt.
6: 14, 15. Pursuing Peace Brings Blessings
18, 19.
What benefits result from pursuing peace?
Our pursuing “the things making for peace ” brings us rich blessings.
We enjoy a close personal relationship with Jehovah as we imitate his ways, and we contribute to the peaceful unity of our spiritual paradise.
Pursuing peace inside the congregation also helps us to see ways in which we can pursue peace with those to whom we preach “the good news of peace. ”
We are better prepared ‘ to be gentle toward all, keeping ourselves restrained under evil. ’ ​ — 2 Tim.
2: 24. Remember, too, that there will be “a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. ”
When that hope becomes a reality here on earth, millions of people with varying backgrounds, temperaments, and personalities will be brought back to life ​ — and that from times stretching all the way back to “the founding of the world ”!
Teaching resurrected ones the ways of peace will indeed be a great privilege. What a tremendous help the training we now receive as peacemakers will be to us at that time!
For Scriptural guidance in dealing with such serious sins as slander and fraud, see The Watchtower, October 15, 1999, pages 17 - 22.

Jehovah loves those who freely forgive others
Have you carefully read the recent issues of The Watchtower?
Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
• What three keys can help us to resist any tendency toward dishonesty?
They are: (1) Develop a healthy fear of God. (2) Cultivate a Bible - trained conscience. (3) Work hard to promote a sense of contentment. ​ — 4 / 15, pages 6 - 7.
• How do we know that serving God with seriousness does not mean always having a stern appearance or avoiding relaxation?
He enjoyed relaxing meals with others. We know that he was not overly serious or stern. Others, even children, were drawn to and comfortable with him. ​ — 4 / 15, page 10.
• What can a couple do if their relationship seems to have weakened after they had children?
They need to reaffirm their love for each other.
A husband can strive to allay any feelings of insecurity his wife may have.
And both need to work at good communication about their feelings and physical needs. ​ — 5 / 1, pages 12 - 13.
• What was illustrated by the olive tree in Romans chapter 11?
The olive tree pertains to the secondary part of Abraham’s seed, spiritual Israel.
Jehovah is like the root and Jesus like the trunk of this symbolic olive tree.
When most of the natural Jews rejected Jesus, Gentiles who became believers could be grafted in, thus producing the full number of the secondary part of the seed of Abraham. ​ — 5 / 15, pages 22 - 25.
• What especially good news can we offer to the poor?
The good news is: God has appointed Jesus as King.
He is the ideal Ruler to end poverty.
Why? Because he is to rule all mankind and has the power to act; he has compassion for the poor; and he can end the cause of poverty, our inherited tendency to be selfish. ​ — 6 / 1, page 7.
• What did Jesus mean when he told Caiaphas: “You yourself said it ”? ​ — Matt.
High Priest Caiaphas had asked whether Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God. Jesus ’ response: “You yourself said it ” was an affirmative reply. ​ — 6 / 1, page 18.
Jesus ’ perfect life alone corresponded to Adam’s. ​ — 6 / 15, page 13.
• How can Christians show that they take to heart the warning about false teachers recorded at Acts 20: 29, 30?
They do not receive into their homes or greet false teachers.
Christians avoid the literature of apostates, TV programs featuring them, and Web sites containing their teachings. ​ — 7 / 15, pages 15 - 16. • Who should teach children about God?

Is There Someone Behind All Evil?
“I SHOOK hands with the devil. ”
So said the commander of the United Nations forces in Rwanda, reflecting on their failure to stop the genocide in that land during 1994.
Commenting on the unbelievable savagery at that time, another observer stated: “If someone still dares to deny Satan, meet me at a mass grave in Rwanda. ”
Are such atrocities really the work of the Devil?
Most people do not regard wanton violence and cruelty as the work of an invisible wicked spirit creature.
Many think that such things are a result of the evil inherent in human nature and that the main cause of evil is our own dark instincts.
Others theorize that a group of the wealthy and powerful, some sort of a shadowy global network, has been manipulating people for decades in order to rule the world.
Then, of course, there are those who blame the national governments and rulers for all the injustice and suffering they see.
What do you believe?
Why is it that evil, cruelty, atrocities, and suffering run rampant throughout the world today in spite of efforts to curb them?
Why is it that mankind seems to be dashing headlong into a self - destructive course, turning a deaf ear to repeated warnings?
Is there someone behind it all?
Who really rules the world?
The answer might surprise you.
Who Really Rules the World?
LIKELY you have never met any leaders of organized crime.
Does that mean they do not exist?
Criminal bosses are skilled at hiding their identity or even operating from behind prison bars.
Yet, newspaper headlines about drug wars, prostitution rings, and human trafficking, to name a few, remind us of the corrupting influence and dire consequences of the activities and of the existence of such crime figures.
By the mark they leave on human society, we know that criminal leaders exist.
God’s Word, the Bible, reveals that Satan is a real person who, like a powerful criminal kingpin, sees to it that his will is accomplished through “lying signs ” and“ unrighteous deception. ”
In fact, he “keeps transforming himself into an angel of light, ” says the Bible.
The Devil’s existence can likewise be ascertained by the marks left by him.
Yet, most people find it difficult to believe in an invisible, wicked spirit being.
Before we examine more closely what the Bible says about the Devil, let us look at some common obstacles and erroneous beliefs that prevent many from accepting the idea that the Devil is a real person.
▪ “How could a loving God create the Devil? ”
Since the Bible says that God is good and perfect, it seems contradictory to think that he would have created an evil, malicious, and wicked being.
The fact is that the Bible does not say that God created such a person.
On the contrary, it says about God: “The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice.
A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice; righteous and upright is he. ” ​ — Deuteronomy 32: 4; Psalm 5: 4.
The point to consider is whether a perfect person created by God could do anything other than what is right.
Far from making his creatures like robots, God granted them free will ​ — the ability to make their own choices.
Hence, a perfect, intelligent creature can choose to do good or to do evil.
In reality, only deeds performed by an intelligent creature, human or spirit, endowed with free will could have real moral significance.
It follows, therefore, that God would not have granted his creatures moral freedom and at the same time prevented them from doing evil should they choose to do so.
Jesus referred to a misuse of free will when he said of the Devil: “He did not stand fast in the truth. ”
That statement clearly indicates that the one who became the Devil was originally a perfect spirit person, who at one time did “stand fast in the truth. ”
* Jehovah God made his creatures free moral agents because he loves and trusts them. ​ — See the box “Could a Perfect Creature Lose Perfection? ”
on page 6.
▪ “The Devil is a servant of God ” For some, the Bible seems to suggest this idea in the book of Job.
According to one Bible commentary, the statement that the Devil was “roving about in the earth ” refers to the role of ancient Persian spies, who traveled and reported matters in the service of their king.
However, if the Devil were really God’s spy, why would he have to explain to God that he had come from “roving about in the earth ”?
Far from depicting him as an ally of God, the account in Job calls the Devil by the name Satan, meaning “Resister, ” thus indicating that he is actually God’s chief Adversary.
Where, then, does the idea that the Devil is in God’s service come from?
As early as the first century C.E., apocryphal books, such as the “Book of Jubilees ” and the“ Common Rule ” of the Qumran sect, depicted the Devil as bargaining with God and yet subject to His will.
In his book Mephistopheles, historian J.
Russell explains that Protestant Reformer Martin Luther regarded the Devil as God’s tool, “like a pruning hook or a hoe that he uses to cultivate his garden. ”
The idea is, adds Russell, that “the hoe takes pleasure in destroying the weeds, ” but it remains in God’s mighty hand, thus fulfilling God’s will.
Luther’s teaching ​ — later accepted by French theologian John Calvin — ​ offended many believers ’ sense of justice.
How could a loving God not only permit evil but even will it to happen?
This doctrine, along with the horrors of the 20th century, prevents many people from believing both in God and in the Devil.
▪ “The Devil is merely a principle of evil ” To consider the Devil a mere principle of evil would make some Bible passages almost impossible to understand.
For instance, as described at Job 2: 3 - 6, with whom was God having a conversation?
Was he possibly speaking to an abstract principle of evil in Job, or was he perhaps even talking to himself?
Furthermore, would God be praising the virtues of Job at one moment and allowing Job to be tested by a principle of evil the next?
Ascribing such motives to God would amount to making him a perverse Being, not the one “in whom there is no unrighteousness. ”
Quite the contrary, God refused to ‘ thrust out his hand ’ to harm Job.
Clearly, the Devil is not a principle of evil or a dark side of God’s personality but a spirit person who made himself God’s Adversary.
Who Really Is Ruling the World?
Today, many feel that it is old - fashioned to believe in the Devil.
However, no explanation for the harsh reality of evil, apart from the Devil, has proved satisfactory.
In fact, the attempt to do away with the idea of the Devil has led many people to reject God and any moral boundaries altogether.
“The devil’s deepest wile, ” wrote 19th - century poet Charles - Pierre Baudelaire,“ is to persuade us that he does not exist. ”
By concealing his identity, the Devil has actually raised doubts about the existence of God.
If the Devil did not exist, would that not make God responsible for all evil?
Is that not exactly what the Devil wants people to believe?
Like a criminal boss, the Devil conceals his identity in order to achieve his objective.
The Bible answers: “The god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through. ” ​ — 2 Corinthians 4: 4.
One important question remains.
What will God do with this secret mastermind who is behind all evil and suffering?
This we will consider in the following article.
To understand why God did not immediately put an end to the Devil’s rebellion, see chapter 11 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach?
published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.
[Blurb on page 5]
Is the Devil a servant of God or a resister of God?
[Box / ​ Picture on page 6]
Could a Perfect Creature Lose Perfection?
The perfection granted by God to his intelligent creatures is relative.
Although created perfect, Adam needed to respect the physical limits imposed upon him by his Creator.
For example, he could not eat dirt, gravel, or wood without suffering the consequences.
If he had ignored the law of gravity and jumped from a high cliff, he would have died or been severely injured.
Likewise, no perfect creature ​ — human or angelic — ​ can go beyond the moral boundaries set by God without exposing himself to ill effects.
Thus, when an intelligent creature misuses his free will, he easily falls into error and sin. ​ — Genesis 1: 29; Matthew 4: 4.
The World’s Secret Ruler Exposed
“THE ruler of this world will be cast out, ” said Jesus to the people on one occasion.
Later, he added that ‘ the ruler of the world had no hold on him ’ and that “the ruler of this world has been judged. ”
Of whom was Jesus speaking?
Considering what Jesus was saying about “the ruler of this world, ” it is obvious that he could not have been referring to his Father, Jehovah God.
Who, then, is “the ruler of this world ”?
How will he be “cast out, ” and how has he been“ judged ”?
“The Ruler of This World ” Reveals Himself
Just as a master criminal often takes pride in boasting about his power, so did the Devil when tempting Jesus, the Son of God.
After showing Jesus “all the kingdoms ” of the world, Satan made him this offer:“ I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me, and to whomever I wish I give it.
You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours. ” ​ — Luke 4: 5 - 7.
If the Devil were merely a principle of evil, as some have suggested, how could that temptation be explained?
Was Jesus being tempted by some evil thought or by some inner turmoil that possibly followed his baptism?
If so, how could it be said that “there is no sin in him ”?
Far from denying the Devil’s power over mankind, Jesus actually confirmed it by speaking of him as “the ruler of the world, ” describing him as“ a murderer ” and “a liar. ” ​ — John 14: 30; 8: 44; The New Jerusalem Bible.
Some 60 years after Christ’s encounter with the Devil, the apostle John reminded Christians of the Devil’s powerful influence, saying that “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one. ”
That one, John also said, “is misleading the entire inhabited earth. ”
Clearly, the Bible speaks of an invisible spirit as “the ruler of the world. ”
But what is the extent of his influence over mankind?
The World Ruler Delegates Power to Associates
Writing about the Christians ’ fight for the faith, the apostle Paul clearly identified their worst enemies.
“We have a wrestling, ” he candidly said,“ not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places. ”
Thus, this fight goes beyond the human sphere, since it is carried out, “not against blood and flesh, ” but against“ wicked spirit forces. ”
According to most modern Bible translations, “the wicked spirit forces ” here refer, not to an abstract principle of evil, but to powerful wicked spirit persons.
Thus, the Devil has been exercising his power through other rebel angels who forsook “their own proper dwelling place ” in heaven. ​ — Jude 6.
The prophetic Bible book of Daniel discloses how these “world rulers ” have been exerting control over the world since ancient times.
Deeply concerned about fellow Jews who in 537 B.C.E. had returned to Jerusalem from their Babylonian exile, the prophet Daniel prayed in their behalf for three weeks.
An angel, sent by God to reassure the prophet, told him why his arrival had been delayed.
He said: “The prince of the royal realm of Persia was standing in opposition to me for twenty - one days. ” ​ — Daniel 10: 2, 13.
Who was this ‘ prince of Persia ’?
The angel was obviously not referring to Persian King Cyrus, who at that time looked with favor upon Daniel and his people.
Moreover, how could a mere human king resist a spirit creature for three weeks when it took one angel only one night to destroy 185,000 mighty warriors?
This hostile ‘ prince of Persia ’ could only be an agent of the Devil, that is, a demon who was given control over the realm of the Persian Empire.
Later in the account, God’s angel stated that he would once again have to fight against “the prince of Persia ” and another demon prince,“ the prince of Greece. ” ​ — Daniel 10: 20.
What can we conclude from this?
Simply that there really are invisible “world rulers, ” demon princes who share control of the world under the authority of their chief, Satan the Devil.
But what has been their aim until now?
The World Ruler Shows His True Face
In the last book of the Bible, Revelation, the apostle John relates how Jesus, as Michael the archangel, defeats the Devil and his demons and tells of the disastrous consequences resulting from their expulsion from heaven.
We read: “Woe for the earth... because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time. ” ​ — Revelation 12: 9, 12.
How has the Devil shown great anger?
Just as many desperate criminals follow the policy of ‘ rule or ruin, ’ the Devil and his demons are determined to bring the earth and its inhabitants to ruin with them.
Knowing that his time is short, the Devil has been using one of the key elements of human society under his control ​ — big business — ​ to promote a frenzied spirit of consumerism, which leads to depletion of natural resources and destruction of the environment worldwide, thus threatening humanity’s survival. ​ — Revelation 11: 18; 18: 11 - 17.
Since the beginning of human history, the Devil’s thirst for power has also been reflected in politics and religion.
The book of Revelation depicts political powers as wild beasts to whom the Devil has given “great authority. ”
It also describes the shameless alliance between politics and religion as disgusting spiritual adultery.
Think of the oppression, enslavement, wars, and ethnic conflicts over the centuries that have resulted in the loss of millions of lives.
Can anyone honestly say that the shocking and horrifying events that have tainted the pages of human history were the normal activity of humans?
Or were they the result of manipulation by unseen wicked spirit forces?
The Bible unmistakably identifies and unmasks the one who has been maneuvering human leaders and world powers.
Whether consciously or not, human society reflects the personality of its ruler and his ‘ rule or ruin ’ policy.
But for how long will humankind suffer under the Devil’s rulership?
The Devil’s Last Gasp
Christ’s activity on earth in the first century sounded the death knell for the Devil and his demons.
When Jesus ’ disciples related how they had cast out unseen demons, he told them: “I began to behold Satan already fallen like lightning from heaven. ”
With those words, Jesus was rejoicing at his future victory over the ruler of the world, to take place once Jesus was back in heaven as Michael the archangel.
A thorough study of Bible prophecies indicates that this victory took place in heaven in or shortly after 1914.
Since that date, the Devil knows that the time remaining before his destruction is short.
Although ‘ the whole world is lying in his power, ’ millions of people today have not been misled by his desperate attempts to control them.
The Bible has opened their eyes to his true identity and his designs.
They draw hope from Paul’s words to fellow Christians: “The God who gives peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly. ”
* ​ — Romans 16: 20. Soon will come the Devil’s last gasp!
Under Christ’s loving rulership, righteous humans will turn God’s symbolic footstool, the earth, into a paradise.
Violence, hatred, and greed will be gone forever.
“The former things will not be called to mind, ” says the Bible.
What a relief it will be for all who break free from the secret ruler of this world and his authority!
For more details on this date, see the appendix to the book What Does the Bible Really Teach?
published by Jehovah’s Witnesses, pages 215 to 218.
Paul’s words here echo the first Bible prophecy, recorded at Genesis 3: 15, pointing to the Devil’s eventual destruction.
To describe the event, Paul used a Greek word that means “to shatter, shiver, break in pieces by crushing. ” ​ — Vine’s Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words.

3 Bible Reading ​ — My Lifelong Source of Strength
30 Can You Be Like Phinehas When You Face Challenges?
Bible Reading ​ — My Lifelong Source of Strength
As told by Marceau Leroy
“IN THE beginning God created the heavens and the earth, ” I began reading in the privacy of my room.
Why did I read in secret?
Surely my father, a confirmed atheist, would not approve of the book I had in my hands ​ — the Bible.
I had never read the Bible before, and those opening words of Genesis struck me like a bolt of lightning.
I thought, ‘ Here is the explanation for the harmony of the physical laws that has always amazed me! ’
Enthralled, I read from eight at night until four in the morning.
Thus began my lifelong habit of reading God’s Word.
Let me explain how Bible reading has been a source of strength to me throughout my life.
“You Will Have to Read It Every Day ”
I was born in 1926, in Vermelles, a coal - mining village in northern France.
During the second world war, coal was a commodity of national importance.
So as a miner, I was exempt from military service.
Still, to improve my lot, I began studying radio and electricity, which impressed on me the harmony of physical laws. When I was 21, a classmate handed me my first Bible, saying, “It is a book worth reading. ”
By the time I finished reading it, I was convinced that the Bible is God’s Word, a revelation to mankind.
Thinking that my neighbors too would be excited to read the Bible, I obtained eight copies.
To my surprise, I met with mockery and opposition.
Superstitious relatives warned, “Once you start reading this book, you will have to read it every day! ”
Read it I did, and I have never regretted doing so.
It became my lifelong custom.
Recognizing my interest in the Bible, some neighbors passed on to me publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses that they had received.
Booklets such as One World, One Government * (shown in French) explained why the Bible points to God’s Kingdom as the only hope for mankind.
I was more determined than ever to share this hope with others.
One of the first to accept a Bible from me was Noël, a childhood friend.
Being a practicing Catholic, he arranged for us to meet with a man who was studying to become a priest.
I felt intimidated, yet I knew from reading Psalm 115: 4 - 8 and Matthew 23: 9, 10 that God disapproves of using idols in worship and addressing clergymen with religious titles.
This gave me the courage to defend my newfound belief.
As a result, Noël accepted the truth, and to this day he remains a faithful Witness.
I also visited my sister. Her husband had books on spiritism and was being harassed by demons.
Although I felt rather powerless at first, such Bible verses as Hebrews 1: 14 convinced me that I had the support of Jehovah’s angels.
When my brother - in - law applied Bible principles and rid himself of everything connected with the occult, he was able to free himself from demon influence.
Both he and my sister became zealous Witnesses.
In 1947 an American Witness, Arthur Emiot, called at my home.
Excited, I asked him where the Witnesses met.
He told me that there was a group in Liévin, some six miles (10 km) away.
Even bicycles were hard to come by in those days, so for several months I walked to and from the meetings.
The work of Jehovah’s Witnesses in France had been under ban for eight years.
There were only 2,380 Witnesses in the whole country ​ — many being Polish immigrants. But on September 1, 1947, our work in France was legally recognized again.
Because there was not even one pioneer in France, the December 1947 issue of Informant (now Our Kingdom Ministry) launched an appeal for general pioneers, who would preach 150 hours a month.
(In 1949 that was reduced to 100 hours.) In full agreement with Jesus ’ words at John 17: 17, “[God’s] word is truth, ” I was baptized in 1948, and in December 1949, I became a pioneer.
From Prison Back to Dunkerque
My first assignment, Agen, in southern France, was short - lived.
Because I had left the mines, I was eligible for military service. I refused to join the army, so I was sent to prison.
Though I was not allowed to have a Bible, I was able to obtain a few pages of the book of Psalms.
Reading them encouraged me.
When I was released, I had a decision to make: Should I stop the full - time service in order to get settled?
Here again, what I read in the Bible helped me.
I meditated on Paul’s words at Philippians 4: 11 - 13: “For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me. ”
I made up my mind to continue pioneering. In 1950, I received a new assignment ​ — Dunkerque, a town where I had preached before.
When I arrived there, I had nothing.
The town had been severely damaged during World War II, and accommodations were hard to find.
I decided to visit a family I used to call on, and the lady of the house was overjoyed: “Oh, Mr.
Leroy, you’ve been released!
My husband says that if there were more men like you, there never would have been a war. ”
They had a guesthouse, so they offered me lodging until the tourist season started.
The same day, Arthur Emiot’s brother, Evans, offered me work.
* He was an interpreter in the port and was looking for a night watchman to guard a ship.
He introduced me to one of the ship’s first officers. After my time in prison, I was as thin as a rake.
When Evans explained why, the officer told me to help myself to the food in the refrigerator.
On that one day, I obtained lodging, work, and food!
My confidence in Jesus ’ words recorded at Matthew 6: 25 - 33 had indeed been strengthened.
When the tourist season started, my pioneer partner, Simon Apolinarski, and I had to find other lodging, but we were determined to stay in our assignment.
We were offered accommodations in an old horse stable, where we slept on straw mattresses.
We spent our days in the service.
We witnessed to the owner of the stable, and he became one of many who accepted the truth.
It was not long before an article appeared in the local press, warning the inhabitants of Dunkerque of the “outbreak of Jehovah’s Witness activity in the region. ” Yet, Simon and I and a handful of publishers were the only Witnesses there!
In the face of difficulties, we were encouraged by meditating on our Christian hope and considering the way Jehovah had taken care of us.
There were some 30 regular publishers in Dunkerque when my assignment was changed in 1952.
Strengthened for New Responsibilities
After a brief stay in the city of Amiens, I was appointed a special pioneer to serve in Boulogne - Billancourt, a suburb of Paris.
I had many Bible studies, and some of them later took up full - time service and missionary work.
One young man, Guy Mabilat, accepted the truth and went on to serve as a circuit overseer and then as a district overseer.
Later, he had oversight of the construction of the printery at the present - day Bethel in Louviers, some distance from Paris.
Frequent Bible discussions in the ministry further imprinted God’s Word on my mind, filling me with joy and enabling me to improve my teaching ability.
Then in 1953, out of the blue, I was appointed to be a circuit overseer in Alsace - Lorraine, a region that between 1871 and 1945 was twice annexed by Germany.
Hence, I had to learn some German.
When I started in the circuit work, there were few cars, televisions, or typewriters in that region and no transistor radios or personal computers.
But my life was neither sad nor austere.
In fact, it was a most joyful time.
Following the Bible’s advice to keep ‘ a simple eye ’ meant that there were fewer distractions from serving Jehovah than there are today. ​ — Matt.
6: 19 - 22. The 1955 “Triumphant Kingdom ” Assembly in Paris was a memorable occasion for me.
There I met my future wife, Irène Kolanski, who had started full - time service the year before I did. Her Polish parents were longtime, zealous Witnesses.
He had been Brother Russell’s gardener and had come to Europe to declare the good news.
Irène and I were married in 1956, and she joined me in the circuit work.
What a fine support she has been throughout the years!
Two years later, another surprise awaited me ​ — I was appointed a district overseer.
Still, to make up for the shortage of qualified brothers available, I continued to visit some congregations as a circuit overseer.
What a busy time that was!
In addition to preaching 100 hours a month, each week I had talks to give, three book studies to visit, records to check, and reports to prepare. How would it be possible to buy out time to read God’s Word?
I saw only one solution ​ — I cut pages out of an old Bible and kept some with me.
Whenever I had to wait for someone to arrive for an appointment, I took out the pages and read.
Those brief moments of spiritual refreshment strengthened my resolve to continue in my assignment.
In 1967, Irène and I were invited to become permanent members of the Bethel family in Boulogne - Billancourt.
I began working in the Service Department, and over 40 years later, I still have that privilege.
How I delight in digging into God’s Word and “defending... the good news ”!
I also take pleasure in conducting Bible discussions at morning worship before breakfast.
In 1976, I was appointed to be a member of the Branch Committee in France.
The Best Way of Life
Although I have experienced trialsome times, the most challenging time in my life is now, when old age and health problems limit what Irène and I can do.
Still, reading and studying God’s Word together keeps our hope alive.
We enjoy taking the bus to our congregation territory to share this hope with others. Our combined experience of more than 120 years in full - time service moves us to recommend wholeheartedly this course to all who wish to pursue an exciting, joyful, and useful life.
When King David wrote the words of Psalm 37: 25, he had “grown old, ” but like him, I too“ have not seen anyone righteous left entirely. ”
Throughout my life, Jehovah has strengthened me by means of his Word. My relatives predicted over 60 years ago that Bible reading would be a lifelong habit.
They were right. It has been ​ — a daily habit that I have never regretted!
Published in 1944, but now out of print.

Jehovah Is My Share
“I am your share and your inheritance in the midst of the sons of Israel. ” ​ — NUM.
18: 20.
1, 2. (a) What was the situation of the Levites as to a land inheritance?
(b) What assurance did Jehovah give the Levites?
AFTER the Israelites had conquered much of the Promised Land, Joshua turned his attention to apportioning the land by lot.
In doing this, he worked along with High Priest Eleazar and heads of the tribes.
As for the Levites, they were not to have a land inheritance such as the other tribes received.
Why did the Levites have no tribal territory, or share, of the Promised Land?
Were they being left out? We find the answer in what Jehovah told the Levites.
Underlining the fact that they were not being abandoned, Jehovah said to them: “I am your share and your inheritance in the midst of the sons of Israel. ”
What a profound assurance: “I am your share ”!
How would you feel if Jehovah said that to you?
Your first reaction might be, ‘ Am I worthy of such an assurance from the Almighty? ’
You might also wonder, ‘ Can Jehovah really be the share of any imperfect Christian today? ’
Those questions involve you and your loved ones. So let us determine what that divine statement means.
That will help us understand how Jehovah can be the share of Christians today.
More specifically, he can be your share, whether you hope to live in heaven or you look forward to life in an earthly paradise.
Jehovah Provides for the Levites
What led to God’s taking the Levites for his service?
Before Jehovah gave the Law to the Israelites, family heads served as priests among them.
When God provided the Law, he arranged for a full - time priesthood and for assistants from the tribe of Levi.
How did this come about?
When God destroyed Egypt’s firstborn, he sanctified Israel’s firstborn, setting them apart as his, as belonging to him.
Then God made this significant adjustment: “I do take the Levites... in place of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel. ”
Since a census showed that the firstborn sons of Israel exceeded the Levites in number, a ransom price was paid to make up the difference.
Thus the Levites could carry out their role in serving the God of Israel.
4, 5. (a) What did it mean for the Levites to have God as their share?
(b) How did God provide for the Levites?
Jehovah said that he was to be their share in the sense that rather than receiving a land inheritance, they were entrusted with a priceless privilege of service.
Being “the priesthood of Jehovah ” was their inheritance.
The context of Numbers 18: 20 shows that this did not leave them impoverished materially.
(Read Numbers 18: 19, 21, 24.)
The Levites were to be given “every tenth part in Israel as an inheritance in return for their service. ” They would receive 10 percent of Israel’s produce and of the increase of the domestic animals.
In turn, the Levites were to contribute a tenth part of what they received, “of the very best of it, ” for the support of the priesthood.
* The priests were also given “all the holy contributions ” that the sons of Israel brought to God at his place of worship.
Members of the priesthood thus had good reason for believing that Jehovah would provide for them.
It appears that the Mosaic Law provided for a second tithe, which was set aside for the household’s sustenance and enjoyment during the holy conventions each year.
However, at the end of every third and sixth year of the seven - year sabbatical cycle, this tithe was deposited at the gate for the benefit of the poor as well as the Levites.
Why were the Levites included as recipients?
Because they had “no share or inheritance ” in Israel. ​ — Deut.
14: 28, 29.
Though having no tribal share of land in Israel, where would the Levites reside?
You might wonder, ‘ If the Levites had no land assigned to them, where would they reside? ’
God provided for them. He gave them 48 cities along with the surrounding pasture grounds.
These included the six cities of refuge.
Thus, the Levites had a place to live when they were not serving at the sanctuary of God.
Jehovah provided abundantly for those who gave themselves to his service.
Clearly, the Levites were able to show that Jehovah was their share by putting their trust in his willingness and power to provide for them.
What was required of the Levites for them to have Jehovah as their share?
The Law did not include any penalty for an Israelite who failed to tithe.
When the people became negligent as to tithing, the priests and Levites were affected.
That happened in the days of Nehemiah.
As a result, the Levites had to work in their fields, neglecting their ministry. (Read Nehemiah 13: 10.)
Clearly, the sustenance of the Levitical tribe hinged on the spirituality of the nation.
Furthermore, the priests and Levites themselves needed faith in Jehovah and in his means of providing for them.
Individuals Had Jehovah as Their Share
The Levites as a tribe were to have Jehovah as their share.
It is noteworthy, though, that individual Levites used the phrase “Jehovah is my share ” to express devotion to God and reliance on him.
We will refer to him as Asaph, though he could have been a member of the house of Asaph, the Levite who led the singers in the days of King David.
In Psalm 73 we read that Asaph (or one of his descendants) became perplexed.
He envied the wicked who were leading a prosperous life and went to the point of saying: “Surely it is in vain that I have cleansed my heart and that I wash my hands in innocence itself. ”
He apparently lost sight of his privilege of service; he failed to appreciate that Jehovah was his share.
He was spiritually troubled “until [he] proceeded to come into the grand sanctuary of God. ” ​ — Ps.
73: 2, 3, 12, 13, 17.
9, 10.
Why could Asaph refer to God as his “share to time indefinite ”?
At the sanctuary, Asaph began to view things from God’s perspective.
You may have had a similar experience.
Perhaps at one point you lost sight of your spiritual privileges to some extent and began to focus on what you were lacking in a material way.
But by studying God’s Word and by going to Christian meetings, you came to see things Jehovah’s way.
Asaph perceived what would eventually happen to the wicked.
He thought about his lot and realized that Jehovah would take hold of his right hand and lead him.
Asaph could thus say to Jehovah: “Besides you I do have no other delight on the earth. ”
He then referred to God as his share.
(Read Psalm 73: 26.)
Although the psalmist’s ‘ organism and heart might fail, ’ God would be his “share to time indefinite. ” The psalmist was confident that Jehovah would remember him as a friend.
His faithful service would not be forgotten.
He sang: “As for me, the drawing near to God is good for me.
In the Sovereign Lord Jehovah I have placed my refuge. ” ​ — Ps.
73: 28.
Having Jehovah as his share meant more to Asaph than the material sustenance he received as a Levite.
To preserve that relationship, the psalmist had to maintain faith in Jehovah, trusting in him.
Asaph had to have confidence that the final outcome of his life would be a rewarding one if he lived according to the divine standard.
You can have the same confidence in the Almighty.
What question did Jeremiah have, and how was it answered?
The prophet Jeremiah was another Levite who recognized Jehovah as his share.
Let us consider what he meant when using that expression.
Jeremiah lived in Anathoth, a Levite city near Jerusalem.
At one point, Jeremiah became perplexed: Why were the wicked prospering while the righteous suffered?
After observing what was taking place in Jerusalem and Judah, he felt compelled to ‘ complain ’ about what he saw.
Jeremiah knew that Jehovah is righteous.
What Jehovah thereafter inspired Jeremiah to prophesy and how He fulfilled those prophetic words gave a solid answer to the prophet’s question.
In harmony with divine prophecies, those who obeyed Jehovah’s direction ‘ received their souls as spoil, ’ whereas the prosperous wicked ones ignored the warning and perished. ​ — Jer.
21: 9.
12, 13. (a) What moved Jeremiah to declare: “Jehovah is my share, ” and what attitude did he have?
(b) Why did all the tribes of Israel need to cultivate a waiting attitude?
It was as if Jehovah had made him “sit like men dead for a long time. ”
Jeremiah had told the wayward nation to return to their heavenly Father, but their badness had reached the point where God had to let Jerusalem and Judah be destroyed.
That caused Jeremiah pain, though he was not at fault.
Amid his afflictions, the prophet remembered God’s mercies.
“We have not come to our finish, ” he said. Indeed, Jehovah’s mercies are new each morning!
It was then that Jeremiah declared: “Jehovah is my share. ”
He continued having the privilege of serving Jehovah as a prophet. ​ — Read Lamentations 3: 22 - 24.
For 70 years, the Israelites would lack a homeland.
It would lie desolate.
Jehovah was their only hope. After 70 years, God’s people were restored to their homeland and had the privilege of serving him there. ​ — 2 Chron.
36: 20 - 23.
Others Could Have Jehovah as Their Share
14, 15.
Other than the Levites, who let Jehovah be his share, and why?
Both Asaph and Jeremiah were of the tribe of Levi, but was it only the Levites who could be privileged to serve Jehovah?
Young David, the future king of Israel, called God his “share in the land of the living ones. ” (Read Psalm 142: 1, 5.)
At the time that David composed this psalm, he was not in a palace or even in a house.
On at least two occasions, David took refuge in caves ​ — one near Adullam and the other in the wilderness of En - gedi.
He may well have composed Psalm 142 in one of those caves.
If that was the case, King Saul was the one hounding David, seeking to take his life.
David fled to a cave that was hard to approach.
In this remote region, it might have seemed to David that no friend was at his side to give him protective support.
That was when David called out to God.
16, 17. (a) What reasons did David have for feeling helpless?
(b) Whom could David turn to for help?
By the time David composed Psalm 142, he may have learned what had befallen High Priest Ahimelech, who had unwittingly given him assistance when he was fleeing from Saul.
Jealous King Saul had Ahimelech and his household killed.
David felt responsible for their deaths.
It was as if he had killed the priest who had helped him.
If you had been in David’s position, would you have felt responsible?
Adding to David’s stress was the fact that he had no rest because Saul kept on pursuing him.
Soon thereafter came the death of the prophet Samuel, who had anointed David to be the future king.
That could have added to David’s feelings of helplessness.
Yet, David knew whom he could turn to for help ​ — to Jehovah.
David did not have the same privilege of service as the Levites, but he had already been anointed to perform another type of service, eventually to be the king of God’s people.
Hence, David poured out his heart to Jehovah and continued to look to God for direction.
You too can and should have Him as your share and your refuge as you exert yourself in his service.
How did the ones we discussed in this article show that they had Jehovah as their share?
Those whom we have considered had Jehovah as their share in the sense that they received an assignment of work in his service.
They relied on God for sustenance as they served him. Both the Levites and those of Israel’s other tribes, such as David, could let God be their share.
How can you likewise let Jehovah be your share?
We will discuss that in our next article.
For details about how the priesthood was maintained, see Insight on the Scriptures, Volume 2, page 684.

How was Jehovah the share of the priests and Levites?
[Picture on page 9]
What helped Asaph to continue to have Jehovah as his share?
Are You Letting Jehovah Be Your Share?
“Keep on... seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you. ” ​ — MATT.
6: 33. 1, 2. (a) “The Israel of God ” mentioned at Galatians 6: 16 represents whom?
(b) At Matthew 19: 28, whom do “the twelve tribes of Israel ” represent?
WHEN you read the name Israel in the Bible, what comes to your mind?
Do you think of Isaac’s son Jacob, who was renamed Israel?
Or do you think of his descendants, the ancient nation of Israel? What of spiritual Israel?
When Israel is referred to in a figurative sense, it usually applies to “the Israel of God, ” the 144,000, who are anointed with holy spirit to become kings and priests in heaven.
But consider the special reference to Israel’s 12 tribes that is found at Matthew 19: 28.
Jesus said: “In the re - creation, when the Son of man sits down upon his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also yourselves sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ”
In this verse, “the twelve tribes of Israel ” are those who will be judged by Jesus ’ anointed disciples and who are in line to receive eternal life in Paradise on earth.
They will benefit from the priestly services of the 144,000.
3, 4.
What fine example have faithful anointed ones set?
Like the priests and Levites of old, anointed ones today view their service as a privilege.
The anointed do not expect to be given some territory or location on earth as a possession.
Instead, they look forward to being kings and priests in heaven with Jesus Christ.
They will continue to serve Jehovah in that assignment, as indicated by what we read at Revelation 4: 10, 11 concerning the anointed in their heavenly position. ​ — Ezek.
44: 28.
While on earth, anointed ones live in a way that gives evidence that Jehovah is their share.
Their privilege of serving God is of primary importance to them.
They exercise faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice and follow him continually, thus ‘ making their calling and choosing sure. ’
Their individual circumstances and abilities differ. Yet, they do not use any limitations as an excuse to do only a small amount in God’s service.
On the contrary, they give high priority to God’s service, doing all they can.
And they set a good example for those who hope to live on a paradise earth.
How can all Christians have Jehovah as their share, and why might that be challenging?
Whether we have the heavenly hope or an earthly one, we must ‘ disown ourselves and pick up our torture stake and continually follow Christ. ’
Millions who look forward to life in Paradise on earth are worshipping God and following Christ in that way.
They are not content to do just a little when they sense that they can do more.
Many have been impelled to simplify their life and have become pioneers.
Others manage to pioneer some months each year.
Still others, while unable to pioneer, exert themselves in the ministry.
Such ones are like devoted Mary, who poured perfumed oil on Jesus.
He said: “She did a fine deed toward me....
She did what she could. ”
Our doing all we can may not be easy, for we live in a world dominated by Satan.
Yet, we exert ourselves vigorously and put our trust in Jehovah.
Consider how we do so in four specific areas.
Seeking First God’s Kingdom
(a) How do people in general show that their share is in this life only?
(b) Why is it better to have David’s outlook?
People of the world tend to seek personal interests first as “men of this system of things, whose share is in this life. ”
(Read Psalm 17: 1, 13 - 15.)
With no regard for their Creator, many devote themselves to making a comfortable living, raising a family, and leaving behind an inheritance.
Their share is in this life only.
David, on the other hand, was interested in making “a good name ” with Jehovah, as his son later recommended that all do.
Just like Asaph, David saw that having Jehovah as his Friend was far better than putting his own interests foremost in life.
He rejoiced in walking with God.
In our time, many Christians have put spiritual activities ahead of their secular employment.
What blessing did one brother receive for putting the Kingdom first?
Consider Jean - Claude, in the Central African Republic. He is a married elder with three children.
In that land, finding work is hard, and most people will do almost anything to keep their job.
One day, the production manager told Jean - Claude to begin working nights ​ — starting at 6: 30 p.m., seven days a week.
Jean - Claude explained that in addition to supporting his family materially, he needed to care for their spiritual welfare.
He also stated that he had a responsibility to help the congregation. The manager’s response?
“If you are fortunate enough to have a job, you must forget all other things, including your wife, your children, and your problems.
You must devote your life to your work ​ — nothing but your work. Make your choice: your religion or your work. ”
What would you have done?
Well, Jean - Claude realized that if he lost his job, God would look after him.
He would still have plenty to do in God’s service, and Jehovah would help care for his family’s material needs.
Thus, he attended the next midweek meeting. After that, he got ready to go to work, not sure if he would even have a job.
Just then, he got a phone call.
The manager had been fired, but our brother still had his job.
8, 9.
In what sense can we imitate the priests and Levites in having Jehovah as our share?
Some who have been in a situation where their job seemed at risk may have wondered, ‘ How will I fulfill my responsibility to provide for my family? ’
Whether you have faced a similar challenge or not, from your own experience you are likely sure that you will never be disappointed if God is your share and you highly treasure the privilege of serving him.
When Jesus told his disciples to keep on seeking first the kingdom, he assured them: “All these other things ” ​ — such as what to eat, drink, or put on — ​“ will be added to you. ” ​ — Matt. 6: 33.
Think of the Levites, who did not receive a land inheritance.
Since pure worship was their primary concern, for sustenance they had to rely on Jehovah, who told them: “I am your share. ”
Although we are not serving at a literal temple as the priests and Levites did, we can imitate their spirit, having confidence that Jehovah will provide for us.
Our trust in God’s power to provide becomes more and more important as we move deeper into the last days. ​ — Rev.
13: 17.
Seeking First God’s Righteousness
10, 11.
How have some put their trust in Jehovah in connection with their employment? Give an example.
Jesus also urged his disciples to ‘ keep on seeking first God’s righteousness. ’
This means putting Jehovah’s standard of what is right and what is wrong ahead of human norms. (Read Isaiah 55: 8, 9.)
You may recall that in the past, a number of people were involved in growing tobacco or selling tobacco products, training others in warfare, or producing and selling weapons of war.
After coming to a knowledge of the truth, most chose to change their employment and qualify for baptism. ​ — Isa.
2: 4; 2 Cor.
7: 1; Gal.
5: 14.
Andrew is an example.
When he and his wife learned about Jehovah, they resolved to serve him.
Andrew took much pride in his job but left it. Why?
Because he was working for a nonneutral organization and was determined to put first God’s righteousness.
When Andrew left that job, he had two children, no income, and enough money to last just a few months.
From a human standpoint, it may have seemed that he had no ‘ inheritance. ’
He searched for a job, trusting in God.
Looking back, he and his family can confirm that Jehovah’s hand is not short.
By keeping their life simple, Andrew and his wife have even had the privilege of being in full - time service.
“There have been times when finances, housing, health, and just growing older have made us anxious, ” he says.
“But Jehovah has always stood by us....
We can say without a hint of doubt that serving Jehovah is, without question, the most noble and rewarding human endeavor. ” * ​ — Eccl.
12: 13.
What quality is needed to put God’s standards foremost?
Cite local examples.
Jesus told his disciples: “If you have faith the size of a mustard grain, you will say to this mountain, ‘ Transfer from here to there, ’ and it will transfer, and nothing will be impossible for you. ”
Would you be able to put God’s standards foremost if that would result in difficulties?
If you are uncertain whether you could do so, speak with other members of the congregation.
You will no doubt find it spiritually refreshing to hear their experiences.
Appreciating Jehovah’s Spiritual Provisions
When we exert ourselves in Jehovah’s service, what can we expect as to spiritual provisions?
If you treasure your privilege of serving Jehovah, you can be sure that he will supply your physical and spiritual needs, just as he provided sustenance for the Levites.
Think about David. Though he was in a cave, he could count on God to provide for him.
We too can rely on Jehovah even when we see no way out.
Recall that when Asaph came “into the grand sanctuary of God, ” he gained insight into what was distressing him.
Similarly, we need to turn to the divine Source of our spiritual nourishment.
Thus we show appreciation for our privilege of serving God no matter what our circumstances may be.
We are thereby letting Jehovah be our share.
14, 15.
How should we respond when there is increased light on certain scriptures, and why?
How do you react when Jehovah, the Source of spiritual enlightenment, sheds light on “the deep things of God ” found in the Bible?
We have an excellent example in the apostle Peter’s reaction when Jesus told His listeners: “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves. ”
Taking those words literally, many disciples said: “This speech is shocking; who can listen to it? ”
They “went off to the things behind. ”
But Peter said: “Lord, whom shall we go away to?
You have sayings of everlasting life. ” ​ — John 6: 53, 60, 66, 68.
Peter did not fully understand what Jesus said about eating His flesh and drinking His blood.
But the apostle relied on God for spiritual enlightenment.
When spiritual light on some matter gets brighter, do you try to understand the underlying Scriptural reasons for the adjustment?
The first - century Beroeans received the word “with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily. ”
Imitating them will deepen your appreciation for your privilege to serve Jehovah, to have him be your share.
Marrying Only in the Lord
How can God be our share regarding the command found at 1 Corinthians 7: 39?
Another area in which Christians need to keep God’s purposes in mind is in applying the Bible’s direction to marry “only in the Lord. ” Many have chosen to remain single rather than disregard this divine counsel. God kindly takes in such ones.
What did David do when he felt lonesome and seemingly lacked any help?
“Before [God] I kept pouring out my concern, ” he said.
“Before him I continued to tell about my own distress, when my spirit fainted away within me. ”
Similar feelings may have surfaced in the prophet Jeremiah, who served God faithfully for decades as a single person.
You may want to study his example as discussed in chapter 8 of the book God’s Word for Us Through Jeremiah.
How does one single sister cope with occasional loneliness?
“I have never resolved to remain single, ” says a sister in the United States.
“I am open to getting married when I meet the right person.
My unbelieving mother tried to convince me to marry just about anyone who came along.
I asked her if she wanted to be responsible if my marriage turned out badly.
In time, she saw that I had a stable job, was taking care of myself, and was happy. She stopped pressuring me. ”
This sister at times feels some loneliness.
“Then, ” she says,“ I try to make Jehovah my confidence.
He never forsakes me. ”
“Prayer helps me sense that God is real and that I am never alone.
The Most High of the universe is listening, so how could I not feel dignified and joyful? ”
Confident that “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving, ” she says:“ I try to give of myself to help others, not expecting anything in return.
When I am thinking, ‘ What can I do to help this person? ’
I have inner joy. ” Yes, she has Jehovah as her share, and she is enjoying her privilege of serving him.
In what sense can Jehovah make you his share?
No matter what situation you find yourself in, you can let God be your share.
As you do, you will be counted among his happy people.
That can result in your being Jehovah’s share, as was true of others in the past. (Read Deuteronomy 32: 9, 10.)
Just as Israel became God’s share among the nations, he can mark you as his and lovingly care for you. ​ — Ps.
17: 8.
See Awake!

Jeremiah’s example is encouraging
Run the Race With Endurance
“Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us. ” ​ — HEB. 12: 1.
1, 2.
To what did the apostle Paul compare the Christian life course?
EACH year, marathons are held in many places.
The so - called elite runners enter the race with one objective ​ — to win.
Most others who participate aim a bit lower.
For them, just to finish the race is an accomplishment to be proud of.
In the Bible, the Christian life course has been compared to a race.
The apostle Paul called this point to the attention of his fellow Christians in ancient Corinth in his first letter to them.
He wrote: “Do you not know that the runners in a race all run, but only one receives the prize?
Run in such a way that you may attain it. ” ​ — 1 Cor. 9: 24.
Why did Paul mention that only one runner wins?
Of course not! Runners in the competitions trained and exerted themselves rigorously with the goal of becoming the winner.
Paul wanted his fellow Christians to exert themselves that way in their quest for everlasting life.
Doing so, they could hope to gain the prize of life.
Yes, in the Christian race, all who finish win that prize.
What do we need to consider regarding the race that is set before us?
Those words are encouraging, yet sobering, to all who have taken up the race for life today.
Because the prize ​ — whether life in heaven or life in Paradise on earth — ​ is beyond compare.
True, the race is long and arduous; there are many obstacles, distractions, and dangers along the way.
Sadly, some have slowed down, given out, or even fallen along the way.
What pitfalls and dangers are there in the race for life?
How can you avoid them?
What can you do to finish and thus win that race?
Endurance Needed to Win
As recorded at Hebrews 12: 1, Paul made what reference to a race?
In his letter to the Hebrew Christians in Jerusalem and Judea, Paul again made reference to features of athletic games or races. (Read Hebrews 12: 1.)
He not only called attention to the reason for engaging in the race but also pointed out what one must do to win.
Before we examine Paul’s inspired advice to the Hebrew Christians to see what lessons there are for us, let us consider what prompted Paul to write the letter and what he was trying to encourage his readers to do.
Christians were under what pressure from religious leaders?
The first - century Christians, especially those living in Jerusalem and Judea, were facing many trials and hardships.
They were under great pressure from the Jewish religious leaders, who still wielded powerful influence over the people.
Earlier, these leaders had succeeded in having Jesus Christ condemned as a seditionist and killed as a criminal.
And they were not about to stop their opposition.
In the book of Acts, we read one account after another of their threats and attacks against Christians, starting almost immediately after the miraculous events at Pentecost 33 C.E.
This certainly made life difficult for the faithful ones. ​ — Acts 4: 1 - 3; 5: 17, 18; 6: 8 - 12; 7: 59; 8: 1, 3.
What critical times were upon Christians to whom Paul wrote?
He had also told his followers about events that would take place just prior to the end, giving them specific instructions on what action to take to survive.
(Read Luke 21: 20 - 22.)
What, then, would they do? Jesus warned: “Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you. ” ​ — Luke 21: 34.
What might have caused some Christians to slow down or give out?
At the time Paul wrote his letter to the Hebrews, nearly 30 years had passed since Jesus gave that warning.
How did the passage of time affect those Christians?
Some succumbed to the pressures and distractions of daily life and failed to make the spiritual advancement that would have fortified them.
Others apparently felt that life would be so much easier if they just went along with the majority of Jews around them.
Those Jews, after all, had not completely abandoned God; they were still following his Law to some extent.
Other Christians were persuaded or intimidated by individuals in the congregation who clamored for sticking to the Mosaic Law and tradition.
What might Paul say that would help his Christian brothers to keep spiritually alert and endure in the race?
9, 10. (a) Toward the end of Hebrews chapter 10, we read what encouragement by Paul?
(b) Why did Paul write about the faithful acts of ancient witnesses?
It is interesting to observe the way Paul, under divine inspiration, sought to strengthen the Hebrew Christians.
In chapter 10 of his letter, Paul pointed out that the Law was but “a shadow of the good things to come ” and clearly demonstrated the value of the ransom sacrifice of Christ.
Toward the end of that chapter, Paul admonished his readers: “You have need of endurance, in order that, after you have done the will of God, you may receive the fulfillment of the promise.
For yet ‘ a very little while, ’ and ‘ he who is coming will arrive and will not delay. ’ ” ​ — Heb.
10: 1, 36, 37. In Hebrews chapter 11, Paul skillfully explains what true faith in God is.
And he illustrates it by historical examples of men and women of faith.
Was that an unnecessary digression? Not at all.
The apostle knew that his fellow worshippers needed to realize that faith called for courageous action and endurance.
The sterling example set by those ancient faithful servants of Jehovah would strengthen the Hebrews to deal with the trials and hardships they faced.
Thus, after enumerating the acts of faith of those loyal ones in the past, Paul could say: “Because we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also put off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us. ” ​ — Heb. 12: 1.
“A Cloud of Witnesses ”
Thinking of the ‘ great cloud of witnesses ’ can have what effect on us?
The ‘ great cloud of witnesses ’ were no mere spectators or bystanders, as it were, who were there only to watch the race or to see their favorite athlete or team win.
Rather, they were participants, like runners in a race. And they had successfully run the race and finished it.
Though now deceased, they could be thought of as seasoned runners who could encourage newer runners in the race.
Imagine how a contestant would feel if he knew that surrounding, or watching, him were some of the most accomplished runners.
Would he not be moved to do his best or even to outdo himself?
Those witnesses of old could testify that such a figurative race, no matter how strenuous, can be won.
Thus, by keeping closely in mind the example of the “cloud of witnesses, ” the first - century Hebrew Christians could draw courage and ‘ run the race with endurance ’ ​ — as can we today.
How are the examples Paul cited relevant to us?
Many of the faithful ones whom Paul mentioned had circumstances similar to ours.
For example, Noah was living when the pre - Flood world was ending.
We are living near the end of the present system of things.
Abraham and Sarah were called upon to leave behind their homeland to pursue true worship and await the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promise.
We are urged to disown ourselves and gain Jehovah’s approval and the blessings he holds out for us.
Moses journeyed through a fearsome wilderness, heading for the Promised Land.
We are on a course through this dying system of things, heading toward the promised new world.
What these men went through, their successes and failures, as well as their strengths and weaknesses, is truly worthy of our consideration. ​ — Rom.
15: 4; 1 Cor. 10: 11.
They Succeeded ​ — How?
Noah faced what challenges, and what enabled him to overcome them?
What enabled these servants of Jehovah to endure and succeed in the race?
Note what Paul wrote about Noah. (Read Hebrews 11: 7.)
“The deluge of waters upon the earth [that would] bring to ruin all flesh ” was something that Noah had“ not yet beheld. ”
It was something that had never taken place before, something totally unprecedented.
Still, Noah did not dismiss it as impossible or even improbable.
Because he had faith that whatever Jehovah said, Jehovah would do.
Noah did not feel that what he was asked to do was too difficult.
Rather, “he did just so. ”
Considering all that Noah had to do ​ — building the ark, gathering the animals, stocking the ark with food for humans and animals, preaching a warning message, and keeping his family spiritually strong — ​ it was no small task to do “just so. ”
Yet, Noah’s faith and endurance resulted in life and blessings for him and for his family.
What trials did Abraham and Sarah endure, providing what lesson for us?
Abraham and Sarah come next in Paul’s list of the “cloud of witnesses surrounding us. ”
They were uprooted from their normal life in Ur, and their future appeared uncertain.
They proved to be examples of unwavering faith and obedience in trying times.
In conjunction with all the sacrifices that Abraham was willing to make for true worship, he was fittingly called “the father of all those having faith. ”
Paul touched only on the high points, his readers being well - acquainted with the details of Abraham’s life.
Nonetheless, the lesson Paul drew is powerful: “In faith all these [including Abraham and his family] died, although they did not get the fulfillment of the promises, but they saw them afar off and welcomed them and publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land. ”
Clearly, their faith in God and their personal relationship with him helped them run the race with endurance.
What motivated Moses to live as he did?
Moses is another exemplary servant of Jehovah among the “cloud of witnesses. ”
Moses left behind a prosperous, privileged life, “choosing to be ill - treated with the people of God. ”
Paul answered: “He looked intently toward the payment of the reward....
He continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible. ” (Read Hebrews 11: 24 - 27.)
Moses was not distracted by “the temporary enjoyment of sin. ”
God and his promises were so real to Moses that he demonstrated extraordinary courage and endurance.
He exerted himself untiringly in leading the Israelites out of Egypt to the Promised Land.
Why did Moses not become despondent when he was not allowed to enter the Promised Land?
Like Abraham, Moses did not experience the fulfillment of God’s promise in his lifetime.
With the Israelites poised to enter the Promised Land, Moses was told: “From a distance you will see the land, but you will not go there into the land that I am giving to the sons of Israel. ”
This was because earlier he and Aaron, exasperated by the people’s rebelliousness, “acted undutifully toward [God] in the middle of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah. ”
Did Moses become despondent or resentful?
He pronounced a blessing on the people and concluded with these words: “Happy you are, O Israel!
Who is there like you, a people enjoying salvation in Jehovah, the shield of your help, and the One who is your eminent sword? ” ​ — Deut.
33: 29.
Lessons for Us
17, 18. (a) As to our race for life, what can we learn from the “cloud of witnesses ”?
(b) What will be considered in the following article?
From our review of the life of some of those who make up the “cloud of witnesses surrounding us, ” it is clear that for us to run the race to the finish, we must have implicit faith in God and his promises.
Faith cannot be just at the corners of our life; it needs to be at the center of it.
Unlike those without faith, Jehovah’s servants can see beyond the present.
We are able to see “the One who is invisible ” and thus run the race with endurance. ​ — 2 Cor.
5: 7. The Christian race is not easy.
Nonetheless, it is possible for us to finish the race successfully.
In the following article, we will consider what further help we have available.
Can You Explain?
• Why did Paul write at length about the ancient faithful witnesses?
• How can envisioning the “cloud of witnesses surrounding us ” encourage us to run with endurance?
• What have you learned from considering such faithful witnesses as Noah, Abraham, Sarah, and Moses?
[Picture on page 19]
Abraham and Sarah were willing to leave behind the comforts of Ur
That You May Attain It ”
“Run in such a way that you may attain it. ” ​ — 1 COR. 9: 24.
1, 2. (a) What did Paul use to encourage the Hebrew Christians?
(b) What are God’s servants admonished to do?
IN HIS letter to the Hebrews, the apostle Paul used a powerful word picture to encourage his fellow Christians.
He reminded them that they were not alone in running the race for life.
Surrounding them were a ‘ great cloud of witnesses, ’ who had successfully completed the race.
Having clearly in mind the faithful acts and strenuous efforts of these forerunners would give the Hebrew Christians incentive to press on and not to give out in their race.
In the preceding article, we considered the life course of several among the “cloud of witnesses. ”
All demonstrated that unshakable faith enabled them to remain loyal to God, as if they were pressing on in a race to the finish.
We can draw a lesson from their success.
As noted in that article, Paul offered this admonition to his fellow servants, including us: “Let us also put off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us. ” ​ — Heb.
12: 1.
What was Paul’s point of counsel with reference to runners in the Greek games?
Regarding foot racing, one of the popular athletic events of the day, the book Backgrounds of Early Christianity tells us that “the Greeks exercised and competed in the nude. ”
* In such cases, the runners stripped themselves of any extraneous weight or burden that could slow them down.
While we would object to their lack of modesty and propriety, they ran that way with the sole objective of winning the prize.
Paul’s point was that to gain the prize in the race for life, it is essential for runners to remove hindrances of any sort.
This was sound counsel for Christians back then, and it is for us today.
What weights or burdens might hinder us from gaining the prize in the race for life?
“Put Off Every Weight ”
What were people in Noah’s day preoccupied with?
Paul’s counsel was to “put off every weight. ”
That includes everything that might prevent us from giving our full attention and best effort to the race we are running.
What might such weights be?
Looking at Noah ​ — one of those examples cited by Paul — ​ we recall what Jesus said: “Just as it occurred in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of man. ”
Jesus was not speaking primarily about the unprecedented destruction that is to come; he was referring to the people’s way of life.
(Read Matthew 24: 37 - 39.)
The majority of the people in Noah’s day did not show interest in God, let alone endeavor to please him.
What had distracted them?
The real problem was that “they took no note, ” as Jesus said.
What can help us to complete the race successfully?
Like Noah and his family, we have much to do every day.
We need to make a living and to take care of ourselves and our family. That can occupy a large portion of our time, energy, and resources.
Especially in economically challenging times, it is easy to become anxious about life’s necessities.
As dedicated Christians, we also have important theocratic responsibilities. We share in the ministry, prepare for and attend Christian meetings, and keep spiritually strong by personal study and family worship.
Despite all that Noah had to do in serving God, “he did just so. ”
Surely, keeping the weight we have to carry to a minimum, as well as avoiding taking on any unnecessary burden, is vital if we are to run the Christian race to the finish.
6, 7.
We should keep in mind what counsel of Jesus?
What did Paul mean when he said to put off “every weight ”?
Of course, we cannot relieve ourselves completely of every responsibility that we have.
In this regard, bear in mind Jesus ’ words: “Never be anxious and say, ‘ What are we to eat? ’
or, ‘ What are we to put on? ’ For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing.
For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things. ”
Jesus ’ words imply that even so - called normal things like food and clothing can become a burden or a stumbling block if not kept in their proper place.
Focus on Jesus ’ words: “Your heavenly Father knows you need all these things. ”
This implies that our heavenly Father, Jehovah, will do his part to take care of our needs.
To be sure, “all these things ” may be different from what we personally are inclined to like or want.
Still, we are told not to be anxious about “the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. ” Why?
Jesus later advised his listeners: “Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare. ” ​ — Luke 21: 34, 35.
Why is now especially the time to “put off every weight ”?
The finish line is just ahead.
What a pity it would be if we allowed ourselves to be burdened down with unnecessary weights that could impede us when we are so close to the end!
The apostle Paul’s counsel, therefore, is truly wise: “It is a means of great gain, this godly devotion along with self - sufficiency. ”
Our taking Paul’s words to heart will greatly enhance our prospects of attaining the prize.
“The Sin That Easily Entangles Us ”
9, 10. (a) To what does the expression “the sin that easily entangles us ” refer?
(b) How might we be entangled?
In addition to “every weight, ” Paul mentioned putting off“ the sin that easily entangles us. ”
What might that be?
The Greek word translated “easily entangles ” appears only once in the Bible, in this verse.
Scholar Albert Barnes observed: “As a runner would be careful not to encumber himself with a garment which would be apt to wind around his legs in running, and hinder him, so it should be with the Christian, who especially ought to lay aside everything which resembles this. ”
How might a Christian become entangled, with the result that his faith is weakened?
A Christian does not lose his faith overnight.
That might take place gradually, even subtly.
Earlier in his letter, Paul warned about the danger of ‘ drifting away ’ and of ‘ developing a wicked heart lacking faith. ’
When a runner’s legs get entangled with his garment, almost unavoidably he falls.
What might cause him to ignore the danger?
Perhaps carelessness or overconfidence or some distraction.
What lesson can we draw from Paul’s counsel?
What might cause us to lose faith?
We should bear in mind that loss of faith is the end result of what we might do over the course of time.
Regarding “the sin that easily entangles us, ” another scholar notes that it is“ the sin that has the greatest advantage against us, by the circumstances we are in, our constitution, our company. ”
The idea is that our environment, our personal weaknesses, and our associations can all exert a powerful influence on us. They can cause a weakening of our faith or even the loss of it. ​ — Matt.
13: 3 - 9. What reminders should we take to heart so as not to suffer a loss of faith?
Over the years, the faithful and discreet slave class has been reminding us to be careful about what we watch and listen to, that is to say, what we set our hearts and minds on.
We have been warned about the danger of getting entangled in the pursuit of money and possessions.
We might be sidetracked by the glitter and glamour of the entertainment world or by the endless parade of new gadgets.
It would be a serious mistake to feel that such counsel is overly restrictive or that it applies only to others, while we personally are somehow immune to the dangers.
Subtle and deceptive are the entanglements that Satan’s world puts in our way.
Carelessness, overconfidence, and distractions have been the undoing of some, and such things could affect our hope of attaining the prize of life. ​ — 1 John 2: 15 - 17.
How can we protect ourselves against harmful influences?
Day in and day out, we are exposed to people who promote the goals, values, and thinking of the world around us.
(Read Ephesians 2: 1, 2.)
Nonetheless, the degree to which we are affected depends largely on us, on how we react to these influences.
“The air ” that Paul spoke about is death - dealing.
We must constantly be on guard so as not to be choked, or asphyxiated, and thus fail to finish the race.
What help do we have to stay the course?
Jesus is the perfect lead runner, you might say.
We also have Paul’s example, for he counted himself among the runners in the Christian race and urged his fellow believers to imitate him. ​ — 1 Cor. 11: 1; Phil.
3: 14. “You May Attain It ” ​ — How?
How did Paul view his personal share in the race?
How did Paul view his personal share in the race?
In his final address to the elders from Ephesus, he said: “I do not make my soul of any account as dear to me, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received of the Lord Jesus. ”
He was willing to sacrifice everything, including his life, in order to finish the race.
For Paul, all his efforts and hard work in connection with the good news would amount to nothing if he should somehow fail to finish the course.
Yet, he was not self - assured, feeling that he would without fail win the race. (Read Philippians 3: 12, 13.)
Only toward the end of his life did he say with a measure of confidence: “I have fought the fine fight, I have run the course to the finish, I have observed the faith. ” ​ — 2 Tim. 4: 7.
What encouragement did Paul give his fellow runners in the race?
In addition, Paul had an intense desire to see his fellow Christians finish the course and not drop out along the way.
For example, he urged Christians in Philippi to work hard for their own salvation. They needed to keep “a tight grip on the word of life. ”
He continued: “That I may have cause for exultation in Christ’s day, that I did not run in vain or work hard in vain. ”
Similarly, he urged the Christians in Corinth: “Run in such a way that you may attain [the prize]. ” ​ — 1 Cor.
9: 24. Why should we have the goal, or prize, clearly in view?
In a long race, such as a marathon, the finish line is not in sight at first.
Still, all through the race, a runner keeps focused on the finish.
That focus becomes clearer when he knows that the goal is near.
It should be similar in our race.
The goal, or prize, needs to be real to us. That will help us to attain it.
How is faith involved in keeping focused on the prize?
“Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld, ” wrote Paul.
Abraham and Sarah were willing to leave a comfortable way of life behind and live as “strangers and temporary residents in the land. ”
What helped them?
“They saw [the fulfillment of God’s promises] afar off. ” Moses rejected“ the temporary enjoyment of sin ” and “the treasures of Egypt. ”
How did he have the faith and strength to do so?
He “looked intently toward the payment of the reward. ”
Understandably, Paul prefaced his description of each of these people with the expression “by faith. ”
Faith enabled them to look beyond the trials and hardships of the present and see what God was doing in their behalf and would yet do.
To put off “the sin that easily entangles us, ” what positive steps can we take?
By meditating on the men and women of faith mentioned in Hebrews chapter 11 and imitating their example, we can cultivate faith and put off “the sin that easily entangles us. ”
Also, we can “consider one another to incite to love and fine works ” by gathering together with people who are cultivating like faith. ​ — Heb. 10: 24.
How do you feel about keeping focused on the prize?
We are near the end of our race.
The finish line is as good as in sight.
Through faith and with Jehovah’s help, we too can “put off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us. ”
Yes, we can run in such a way that we may attain the prize ​ — the blessings promised by our God and Father, Jehovah.
This was offensive to the Jews of ancient times.
According to the apocryphal book of 2 Maccabees, it caused considerable controversy when, as a Hellenizing effort, the apostate high priest Jason proposed to build a gymnasium in Jerusalem. ​ — 2 Macc. 4: 7 - 17.
Do You Remember?
• What is involved in putting off “every weight ”?
• What might cause a Christian to lose faith?
• Why must we keep our focus on the prize?
[Picture on page 23]
What is “the sin that easily entangles us, ” and how might it entangle us?
Are You Known by Jehovah?
“Jehovah knows those who belong to him. ” ​ — 2 TIM.
2: 19. 1, 2. (a) What was Jesus concerned about?
(b) What questions should we consider?
ONE day a Pharisee approached Jesus and asked: “Which is the greatest commandment in the Law? ”
Jesus responded: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind. ”
Jesus had great love for his heavenly Father and truly lived by those words.
Jesus was also concerned about his standing with Jehovah, demonstrating this by his faithful life course.
Therefore, shortly before his death, he could state that God knew him as one who faithfully obeyed His commandments.
Jesus thus remained in Jehovah’s love. ​ — John 15: 10.
Many today claim to love God.
We no doubt include ourselves in that number.
However, serious aspects to consider are: ‘ Am I known by God?
How does Jehovah view me?
Am I known as belonging to him? ’
What a privilege it is to contemplate such a close relationship with the Sovereign of the universe!
Why do some question whether they can belong to Jehovah, and what will help to counteract such thinking?
Yet, some who have much love for Jehovah find it challenging to believe that God can know them in a positive way.
Some have feelings of worthlessness, so they question the idea of belonging to Jehovah.
How glad we can be, though, that God can see us from a different perspective!
The apostle Paul told his fellow Christians: “If anyone loves God, this one is known by him. ”
Your love for God is an important prerequisite for being known by him.
Consider: Why are you reading this journal?
Why are you striving to serve Jehovah with your whole heart, soul, mind, and strength?
If you are dedicated to God and baptized, what led you to take those steps?
The Bible explains that Jehovah, who examines hearts, draws desirable ones. (Read Haggai 2: 7; John 6: 44.)
Therefore, you can conclude that you are serving Jehovah because he drew you.
He will never leave the ones whom he has drawn if they remain faithful.
God views them as very precious, and he loves them dearly. ​ — Ps.
94: 14.
Why should we continue to reflect on our being known by God?
Once Jehovah has drawn us, we should be concerned with remaining in his love.
(Read Jude 20, 21.)
Remember, the Bible shows that it is possible to drift away or draw away from God.
For example, just prior to the statement found at 2 Timothy 2: 19, the apostle Paul mentioned Hymenaeus and Philetus.
Those two men had evidently belonged to Jehovah at one point, but they later deviated from the truth.
Recall, too, that in the Galatian congregations, some who had been known by God did not remain in the spiritual light they once enjoyed.
May we never take for granted our precious standing with God.
(a) What are some qualities that God values?
(b) What examples will we consider?
There are some qualities that Jehovah especially values.
Faith and humility distinguished some who were known by God.
Let us examine the examples of two men to see how these qualities endeared them to Jehovah.
We will also look at a man who thought he was known by God but who took a prideful course and found out that Jehovah had rejected him.
We can learn valuable lessons from these examples.
The Father of Those Having Faith
(a) Abraham demonstrated what faith in Jehovah’s promises?
(b) How was Abraham known by Jehovah?
Abraham was a man who “put faith in Jehovah. ” In fact, he is called“ the father of all those having faith. ”
In faith, Abraham left his home, his friends, and his possessions to go to a distant land.
Abraham’s faith was still strong many years later.
This was evident when he “as good as offered up Isaac ” his son in obedience to Jehovah’s command.
Abraham demonstrated faith in Jehovah’s promises, so God viewed him as special; he really knew Abraham.
(Read Genesis 18: 19.)
Jehovah was not merely aware of Abraham’s existence; he cherished Abraham as a friend. ​ — Jas. 2: 22, 23.
What is noteworthy about the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises, and how did this affect Abraham?
It is noteworthy that Abraham did not during his lifetime receive the inheritance of the land promised to him.
He also did not see his seed become “like the grains of sand that are on the seashore. ”
Though these promises went unfulfilled during Abraham’s lifetime, he maintained strong faith in Jehovah.
He knew that if God gave his word, it was as good as done. Yes, Abraham lived his life in harmony with that faith.
(Read Hebrews 11: 13.)
Are we known by Jehovah as having faith similar to Abraham’s?
Waiting on Jehovah Is a Mark of Faith
What appropriate desires do some long to see fulfilled?
We may have desires that we long to see fulfilled.
Marriage, having children, and good health are all natural and appropriate desires.
For many, though, one or more of those desires may go unfulfilled.
If that is so in our case, how we deal with the situation may be a measure of our faith.
9, 10. (a) How have some sought to fulfill their desires?
(b) How do you feel about the fulfillment of God’s promises?
How unwise it would be to seek to fulfill these desires in a way contrary to godly wisdom. That would be to one’s spiritual detriment.
Some, for instance, have chosen forms of health care that conflict with Jehovah’s counsel.
Others have taken on employment that keeps them away from their families or congregation meetings.
Or what of developing a romantic relationship with an unbeliever?
If a Christian follows such a course, is he truly seeking to be known by Jehovah?
How would Jehovah have felt if Abraham had become impatient about the fulfillment of God’s promises to him?
What if Abraham had taken matters into his own hands to settle down again and make a celebrated name for himself rather than wait on Jehovah?
(Compare Genesis 11: 4.)
Would he have continued to be favorably known by Jehovah?
Is your faith strong enough for you to wait on Jehovah, who promises to satisfy your proper yearnings?
As was true with Abraham, the fulfillment of some divine promises may not come as soon as we would like.
Still, Jehovah values our developing faith like Abraham’s and our acting in harmony with it.
Doing so is surely to our ultimate benefit. ​ — Heb.
11: 6. A Contrast Between Humility and Pride
Korah may have enjoyed what privileges, evidently indicating what about his attitude toward God?
Moses and Korah stand in sharp contrast when it comes to demonstrating respect for Jehovah’s arrangement and his decisions.
Their reactions had a bearing on how Jehovah viewed them.
Korah was a Kohathite Levite, and he enjoyed many privileges, which likely included seeing the deliverance of the nation through the Red Sea, supporting Jehovah’s judgment against disobedient Israelites at Mount Sinai, and having a role in transporting the ark of the covenant.
He had evidently been loyal to Jehovah for years and was subsequently looked up to by many in the camp of Israel.
As depicted on page 28, how did pride affect Korah’s being known by God?
Nevertheless, while the nation of Israel was en route to the Promised Land, Korah perceived what he imagined to be problems in God’s arrangement. Then 250 other leading men in the nation sided with Korah in trying to make changes.
Korah and the others must have felt secure about their relationship with Jehovah.
They told Moses: “That is enough of you, because the whole assembly are all of them holy and Jehovah is in their midst. ”
What an overconfident and prideful attitude!
Moses told them: “Jehovah will make known who belongs to him. ”
(Read Numbers 16: 5.)
By the end of the next day, Korah and all those who had sided with him in rebellion were dead. ​ — Num.
16: 31 - 35.
13, 14.
In what ways did Moses demonstrate his humility?
In contrast, Moses was “by far the meekest of all the men who were upon the surface of the ground. ”
He manifested his meekness and humility by his determination to follow Jehovah’s direction.
There is no indication that Moses often questioned Jehovah’s way of doing things or got annoyed at having to follow procedures that Jehovah set out.
For example, Jehovah gave commands regarding the tabernacle construction down to the smallest detail, such as the color of the thread and the number of loops to be used in making the tent cloths.
If a human overseer in God’s organization provides you with instructions that seem extremely detailed, you might at times feel frustrated.
Jehovah, however, is a perfect overseer, who delegates generously and trusts his servants.
When he gives many details, he does so for good reason.
Take note, though, that Moses did not become irritated with Jehovah for giving that level of detail, as if Jehovah were demeaning him or stifling his creativity or freedom.
Rather, Moses made sure that the workers “did just so ” in following God’s directions.
What a humble course!
Moses recognized that it was Jehovah’s work and that he was just a tool being used to get that work done.
Moses ’ humility was also evident when he faced negative circumstances that affected him personally.
On one occasion, Moses lost self - control and failed to sanctify God when dealing with the complaining people.
As a result, Jehovah told Moses that he would not take the people into the Promised Land.
He and his brother, Aaron, had endured the grumbling of the Israelites for years.
Then, because Moses erred on that one occasion, he would not get to experience what he had been expecting for so long!
How did Moses react?
While understandably disappointed, Moses humbly accepted Jehovah’s decision.
He knew that Jehovah is a righteous God, with whom there is no injustice.
When you think of Moses, do you not see him as one known by Jehovah? ​ — Read Exodus 33: 12, 13.
Submitting to Jehovah Requires Humility
What can we learn from Korah’s prideful course?
How we react to adjustments in the worldwide Christian congregation and decisions made by those taking the lead in it has a bearing on our being known by Jehovah.
Korah and his associates alienated themselves from God by their overconfidence, pride, and lack of faith.
Although in Korah’s eyes it was aged Moses who was making day - to - day decisions, it was really Jehovah who was directing the nation.
Korah lost sight of that fact and consequently failed to show loyalty to those whom God was using.
How much wiser it would have been for Korah to wait on Jehovah for a clearer understanding or for adjustments if those were really needed.
So in the end, Korah destroyed his record of faithful service by his prideful actions!
How can following Moses ’ example of humility affect our being known by Jehovah?
That account provides a serious warning for elders and others in the congregation today.
Waiting on Jehovah and following directions from those appointed to take the lead requires humility.
Do we show that we are as humble and mild - tempered as Moses was?
Can we acknowledge the position of those taking the lead among us and submit to directions we receive?
Are we able to rise above our personal feelings when faced with disappointments?
If so, we too will be known favorably by Jehovah. Our humility and submission will endear us to him.
Jehovah Knows Those Who Belong to Him
17, 18.
What can help us to continue to be known as belonging to Jehovah?
It is beneficial to reflect on those whom Jehovah drew and knew favorably.
Abraham and Moses were imperfect and had flaws, as we do. Yet, they were known by Jehovah as ones belonging to him.
Korah’s example, however, illustrates that it would be possible for us to draw away from Jehovah and thus no longer be known by him with approval.
Each of us does well to ask himself: ‘ How does Jehovah see me?
What can I learn from these Bible examples? ’
You can take great comfort in knowing that Jehovah views as belonging to him faithful ones whom he has drawn.
Continue to develop faith, humility, and other qualities that further endear you to our God.
Being known by Jehovah is undeniably a precious privilege that brings satisfaction to our life now, and it holds out wonderful blessings for the future. ​ — Ps.
37: 18.
Do You Recall?
• What precious standing can you enjoy with Jehovah?
• How can you imitate the faith of Abraham?
• What lessons can we learn from Korah and Moses?
[Picture on page 26]
Like Abraham, do we have faith that Jehovah will completely fulfill his promises?
[Picture on page 28]
Korah was not willing to submit humbly to direction
[Picture on page 29]
Are you known by Jehovah as one who humbly submits to directions?
Can You Be Like Phinehas When You Face Challenges?
IT IS a precious privilege to serve as a congregation elder.
God’s Word acknowledges, however, that elders face challenges.
On occasion, they must handle cases of wrongdoing in which they ‘ judge for Jehovah. ’
Or an overseer may receive an assignment for which he feels unprepared, as did Moses, who meekly asked regarding one assignment: “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh? ” ​ — Ex.
3: 11.
The Scriptures, written under the influence of the same active force that appoints elders, provide living examples of overseers who faced trials successfully.
Phinehas was the son of Eleazar and the grandson of Aaron and thus was in line to become high priest.
Three events in his life highlight the need for elders today to face challenges with courage, insight, and reliance on Jehovah.
“He at Once Got Up ”
Phinehas was a young man when the Israelites were encamped on the Plains of Moab.
The Bible reports: “The people started to have immoral relations with the daughters of Moab....
And the people began to eat and to bow down to their gods. ”
Jehovah afflicted the wrongdoers with a death - dealing scourge.
Can you imagine how this report of wrongdoing and the scourge it caused must have affected Phinehas?
“Look! ”
the account continues, “a man of the sons of Israel came, and he was bringing near to his brothers a Midianite woman before Moses ’ eyes and before the eyes of all the assembly of the sons of Israel, while they were weeping at the entrance of the tent of meeting. ”
What would priest Phinehas do?
He was relatively young, and the offending Israelite was a chieftain who took the lead in worship among the people. ​ — Num.
25: 14.
But Phinehas feared Jehovah, not men.
When he caught sight of the two, he at once took a lance in his hand and went after the man into the tent and pierced both of them through.
How did Jehovah view Phinehas ’ courage and decisiveness?
Jehovah immediately ended the scourge and rewarded Phinehas with a covenant that the priesthood would remain in his line “to time indefinite. ” ​ — Num.
25: 7 - 13.
Of course, Christian elders today do not resort to violence.
But like Phinehas, elders must be ready to be decisive and courageous.
For example, Guilherme had been serving as an elder for only a few months when he was asked to serve on a judicial committee.
The case of wrongdoing involved an elder who had helped Guilherme when he was younger.
“I felt awkward being in that position, ” he says.“ I found it difficult to sleep at night.
I kept going over in my mind ways to handle this case without letting my emotions blur my spiritual vision.
I prayed for several days and researched Bible publications. ”
This helped him to have the needed courage to handle the unique situation and render spiritual assistance to his erring brother. ​ — 1 Tim.
4: 11, 12. By acting with courage and decisiveness when situations in the congregation require such, elders become examples of faith and loyalty.
Of course, other Christians also need to act courageously, reporting serious wrongdoing that they may become aware of.
Likewise, it takes loyalty to discontinue association with a friend or relative who is disfellowshipped. ​ — 1 Cor.
5: 11 - 13.
Insight Averts a Crisis
Phinehas ’ courage was not mere youthful impetuousness.
Consider how he displayed insight ​ — acting with prudence and discretion — ​ when another report reached his ears.
The tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built an altar near the Jordan River.
Other Israelites concluded that it was for false worship and prepared to take military action. ​ — Josh.
22: 11, 12.
How did Phinehas react?
Phinehas, along with the Israelite chieftains, prudently discussed the matter with those who had built the altar.
The accused tribes clarified the situation, explaining that it actually was an altar for “the service of Jehovah. ”
A crisis was thus averted. ​ — Josh.
22: 13 - 34.
If a Christian hears an accusation or a negative report about a fellow servant of Jehovah, how wise it would be to imitate Phinehas! Insight restrains us from taking offense or revealing unkind observations about our brothers. ​ — Prov.
19: 11.
How can insight assist elders to act as Phinehas did?
“When a publisher starts speaking about a personal difference he is having with another person, ” notes Jaime, an elder for over ten years,“ I quickly ask Jehovah to help me not to take sides but to provide Scriptural guidance. A sister once approached me about a personal problem regarding the way a responsible brother in another congregation had treated her.
Since the brother was my personal friend, it would have been easy for me to speak to him.
Instead, the sister and I reasoned on several Bible principles. She agreed, first of all, to speak to the brother herself.
Peace was not immediately restored. So I urged her to consider other Scriptural principles.
She decided to pray again about the situation and to strive to forgive. ”
What was the result?
“Several months later, ” Jaime recalls,“ the sister approached me. She explained that, in time, the brother regretted what he had said.
He arranged to work with her in the ministry and expressed appreciation for her.
The matter was resolved.
Could I have come up with a better outcome if I, who might have seemed to be partial, had become unduly involved in the dispute? ”
The Bible counsels: “Do not go forth to conduct a legal case hastily. ”
Insightful elders wisely encourage Christians who have personal differences to apply Scriptural principles to promote and achieve peace.
He Inquired of Jehovah
Phinehas was privileged to serve as a priest for God’s chosen people.
As noted, he had extraordinary courage and insight, even at a relatively young age.
However, his success in coping with challenges depended on his trusting in Jehovah.
Following the tragic rape and murder of a Levite’s concubine by the men of Gibeah, of the tribe of Benjamin, the other tribes set out to wage war against the Benjamites.
They prayed for Jehovah’s help before fighting, but they were defeated twice, with significant losses.
Would they conclude that their prayers were ineffective?
Was Jehovah truly interested in seeing them respond to the wrong that had been done?
Unwavering in his confidence, Phinehas, now Israel’s high priest, again came to the fore.
“Shall I go out yet again to battle against the sons of Benjamin my brother or shall I cease to? ”
In response, Jehovah gave the Benjamites into their hand, and Gibeah was burned to the ground. ​ — Judg.
20: 27 - 48.
What lesson might we learn from this?
Some problems faced in the congregation persist despite the elders ’ diligent efforts and prayers for God’s help.
If this occurs, elders do well to remember Jesus ’ words: “Keep on asking [or praying], and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you. ”
For instance, a congregation in Ireland was in desperate need of a Kingdom Hall but did not have the favor of the local planning officer.
He objected to all proposals for the site on which the brothers hoped to build.
It seemed that the only other authority who could approve the proposals was the chief planning officer for the entire county.
Would prayer help, as it did in Phinehas ’ day?
A local elder relates: “After a great deal of prayer and supplication, we traveled to the main planning office.
I was told that it would probably be weeks before we could see the chief officer. However, we managed to meet with him for five minutes.
After he saw the redrawn plans, he quickly gave us permission to continue, and from then on the local planning officer went out of his way to help us.
That experience impressed on us the power of prayer. ”
Yes, Jehovah will answer the sincere prayers of elders who rely on him.
Phinehas carried a heavy load of responsibility in ancient Israel; yet, with courage, insight, and reliance on God, he was able to face challenges successfully.
And Phinehas ’ diligent care for God’s congregation met with Jehovah’s approval.
Some 1,000 years later, Ezra was inspired to write: “It was Phinehas the son of Eleazar that happened to be leader over them in the past.
Jehovah was with him. ”
May that be true of all who take the lead among God’s people today, in fact, of all Christians who serve him loyally.
Why were there money changers in Jerusalem’s temple?
▪ Shortly before his death, Jesus addressed a gross injustice taking place in the temple.
The Bible reports: “Jesus... threw out all those selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
And he said to them: ‘ It is written, “My house will be called a house of prayer, ” but you are making it a cave of robbers. ’ ” ​ — Matthew 21: 12, 13.
First - century Jews and Jewish proselytes traveled from many lands and cities to the temple in Jerusalem, bringing with them coins from their local area.
Yet, they were required to use acceptable currency to pay the annual temple tax, to buy sacrificial animals, and to make other voluntary offerings.
Thus, money changers would, for a fee, convert coins of different origins and denominations into the required currency.
As Jewish festivals approached, these money changers would set up stalls in the temple’s Court of the Gentiles.
Jesus ’ criticism that the money changers were turning the temple into “a cave of robbers ” evidently indicates that the charges for their services were exorbitant.
Why were olive trees particularly appreciated in Bible times?
▪ Olive trees and vineyards were among the blessings that God promised his people for their faithfulness to him.
To this day, the olive tree is highly esteemed in areas in which it grows.
It can produce abundant fruit for hundreds of years with relatively little care.
A cultivated tree can flourish even in rocky soil and can endure frequent droughts.
If the tree is felled, the rootstock produces several shoots that can develop into new trunks.
In Bible times, the bark and leaves of the tree were valued for their fever - reducing properties.
The gum resin that seeps from old branches and has a vanilla scent was used to make perfume.
Primarily, however, the tree was prized as a source of food ​ — its berries and especially its oil.
The pulp of a ripe olive is about half oil.
One good tree could yield as much as 15 gallons (57 L) of oil a year.
Olive oil was also used as lamp fuel, for ceremonial and religious purposes, as a cosmetic for the body and hair, and as a medicine to soften wounds and soothe bruises. ​ — Exodus 27: 20; Leviticus 2: 1 - 7; 8: 1 - 12; Ruth 3: 3; Luke 10: 33, 34.
Our Readers Ask...
Should Infants Be Baptized?
▪ “I was afraid that my little brother, John, was doomed to Limbo, ” relates Victoria.
“John died before he was baptized, ” she explains,“ and a Catholic priest said that for this reason, John would remain in Limbo forever. ”
Such a notion is certainly frightening, but is it Scriptural?
Does the Bible teach that children who die without being baptized are forever doomed?
The Bible does teach that Christians should be baptized.
Jesus instructed his followers: “Make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. ”
Note that those who are baptized must be disciples of Jesus.
That is, they are individuals who have learned about Jesus and have chosen to follow him ​ — a choice that no infant, of course, can make.
Even so, many insist that Jesus ’ command applies to small children.
“Everyone is to be baptized, including infants, ” asserts Lutheran pastor Richard P.
He adds: “To keep them from baptism is to keep them from forgiveness and to endanger them with damnation. ”
In fact, though, such comments contradict Jesus ’ teachings in at least three ways.
First, Jesus did not teach that infants should be baptized.
Why is that fact significant?
Consider: Jesus earnestly taught his disciples about God’s requirements.
At times, he repeated key teachings.
Why? To ensure that his disciples grasped the point. Yet, not even once did he teach that infants should be baptized.
Surely, if infants must be baptized, Jesus would have said so.
Second, Jesus never taught that anyone suffers after death.
He believed the Scriptures, which clearly state: “The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all. ”
Jesus knew that the dead do not languish in purgatory, Limbo, hellfire, or any other location.
Rather, he taught that they are unconscious, as if asleep. ​ — John 11: 1 - 14.
Third, Jesus taught that “all those in the memorial tombs ” will come back to life.
Upon being resurrected, they will have the opportunity to learn God’s requirements and live forever in Paradise on earth.
* ​ — Psalm 37: 29.
Clearly, then, the Bible does not teach that infants should be baptized.
To learn more about the earthly Paradise and the hope of a resurrection, see chapters 3 and 7 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach?

The Bible Changes Lives
WHAT moved a young woman to return to the religious upbringing from which she had strayed?
Read what she has to say.
“I Now Have a Real Purpose in Life. ” ​ — LISA ANDRÉ
YEAR BORN: 1986
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: LUXEMBOURG
HISTORY: PRODIGAL CHILD
MY PAST: I grew up in Bertrange, a clean, safe, and prosperous little town near the city of Luxembourg.
I am the youngest of five children. My parents are Jehovah’s Witnesses, and they worked hard to instill Christian values in my brothers and sisters and in me.
When I entered my early teenage years, I began to have serious doubts about what Jehovah’s Witnesses teach.
At first, I ignored these doubts, but gradually my faith became weaker and weaker.
My parents did everything they could to guide me in the right direction, but I rejected their help.
Without their knowledge, I spent time with young people who had little respect for authority.
I wanted the freedom that their lifestyle seemed to offer.
We partied a lot, slept around, and abused drugs and alcohol.
I was initially glad to be with people who seemed to enjoy life to the full.
Life with those associates was so trivial; no one gave much thought to anything.
By contrast, I was bothered by such issues as the widespread injustice in the world. As time went on, I felt more and more depressed.
HOW THE BIBLE CHANGED MY LIFE: One day when I was 17, I was feeling very low.
Sensing how unhappy I was, my mother asked me to give the Bible another chance. She encouraged me to examine its teachings and then decide for myself whether I wanted to live in harmony with them or not.
That heart - to - heart conversation was a real turning point for me.
I agreed to study the Bible with my older sister Caroline and her husband, Akif.
He had not been raised as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses but had become one as an adult. Because of Akif’s past, I felt that I could speak openly with him, which was important to me.
I knew that my lifestyle was not suitable for a Witness, but initially, I felt that what I did with my life was a personal matter.
From studying the Bible, however, I realized that my conduct affects Jehovah’s feelings.
I also came to understand that it affects other people too.
As I examined the Bible further, I found that there are logical and convincing reasons to believe that it is the Word of God.
For example, I learned of numerous Bible prophecies that have come true ​ — with an amazing degree of accuracy.
Such knowledge helped me to resolve my earlier doubts.
About a year after I started studying the Bible, my parents and I visited my older brother who was a volunteer at the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany.
When I saw how happy my brother was, I felt deeply moved.
That happiness was exactly what I had been looking for!
I was also impressed by the other Witnesses who volunteered there.
They were far different from the dishonest, thrill - seeking people with whom I had been associating.
Shortly thereafter, I offered a heartfelt prayer to Jehovah, promising to serve him for the rest of my life.
At the age of 19, I symbolized my dedication to Jehovah by getting baptized.
HOW I HAVE BENEFITED: I now have a real purpose in life.
I find joy in teaching the Bible to others, helping them to learn about Jehovah and his promises for the future.
My family has also benefited ​ — they no longer worry about me.
I am aware of my past mistakes, but I try not to dwell on them.
Instead, I focus on Jehovah’s forgiveness and on his loving interest in me.
I wholeheartedly agree with the words of Proverbs 10: 22, which says: “The blessing of Jehovah ​ — that is what makes rich, and he adds no pain with it. ”

Teach Your Children
YOU may agree that staying awake when you are at school is important.
Many get sleepy during their class periods, but to learn, you must stay awake.
Perhaps you also go to meetings where you study the Bible.
What do you think you can do to help you stay awake? — * One idea is to go to bed earlier at night.
Maybe a nap in the afternoon will also help.
Let’s see what we can learn from what happened to a youth who fell asleep late one night during a talk by the apostle Paul.
Look in the Bible at Acts chapter 20, verses 7 to 12, and see what happened.
Paul had been visiting the congregation located in the seaport city of Troas.
The Bible says that Paul “was going to depart the next day ” by boat.
So “he prolonged his speech until midnight. ”
We read: “Seated at the window, a certain young man named Eutychus fell into a deep sleep while Paul kept talking on. ”
What happened next? —
Eutychus fell out of the window and “down from the third story. ”
Paul and the others ran down the stairs as fast as they could.
Eutychus was on the ground ​ — dead!
Can you imagine how sad they all felt? — The Bible says that Paul took Eutychus into his arms and hugged him.
Soon Paul cried out with joy: ‘ Don’t worry, he’s all right! ’
God had brought Eutychus back to life!
What can we learn about God from what happened to Eutychus? — One thing is that Jehovah, our heavenly Father, can bring the dead back to life, including young ones.
Jehovah understands and loves you, yes, even more than your parents do.
When Jesus was on earth, he showed what the Father is like by taking little ones into his arms and blessing them.
He also resurrected young people, including a 12 - year - old girl.
How does knowing that your heavenly Father loves you make you feel? — Yes, it makes us love Jehovah in return and want to obey what He says.
Do you know how we can show that we love Him? — One way is by saying that we do.
Jesus said: “I love the Father. ”
But Jesus did more than just say that he loved God.
He showed it by what he did. Jesus obeyed God.
“I always do the things pleasing to him, ” Jesus said.
If we do the same, then to please Jehovah and his Son, Jesus, we will try our best to stay awake when we should.

32 Questions From Readers
[Picture Credit Line on page 2]

“Keep on the Watch ” ​ — Why So Important?
“WHAT will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things? ”
In answer to that question, Jesus gave his disciples a sign that was clear, detailed, recognizable, and unmistakable, as recorded in Matthew chapter 24, Mark chapter 13, and Luke chapter 21.
He added: “Keep on the watch. ” ​ — Matt. 24: 42.
If the sign in itself was to be so evident, why this extra admonition?
Consider these two possibilities. First, distractions might incline some to disregard the sign, resulting in a loss of spirituality and watchfulness.
Second, a Christian might recognize particulars of the sign but because of his immediate surroundings not feel directly affected.
He might then reason that the “great tribulation, ” the culmination of Jesus ’ prophecy, was still quite distant and that it was therefore not yet necessary to“ keep on the watch. ” ​ — Matt. 24: 21.
“They Took No Note ”
Jesus reminded his followers about Noah’s contemporaries.
Noah’s preaching, the construction of the colossal ark, and the violence of the day could not have gone unnoticed.
Nevertheless, most “took no note. ”
A similar attitude toward warnings prevails today.
For example, speed - limit signs send out an unmistakable message, yet many disregard them.
Authorities often feel compelled to install speed bumps across city streets to force drivers to slow down.
Likewise, a Christian may be conscious of the sign of the last days but still become involved in activities not consistent with its implication.
Arielle, a West African teenager, experienced this.
Arielle enjoyed watching women’s handball on television.
When her school organized a team, the prospect of playing dulled her alertness to potential dangers to her spirituality.
She signed up to be a goalkeeper.
What followed?
She explains: “Some of my teammates had boyfriends who used drugs and smoked.
They made fun of me for being different, but I thought I could handle that.
Unexpectedly, the game itself began to corrode my spirituality.
Handball filled my mind and heart.
During Christian meetings, my thoughts often wandered from the Kingdom Hall to the handball court. My Christian personality also suffered.
Love of playing shifted to a passion for winning. I practiced hard to satisfy my new competitive spirit.
Stress built up. I even sacrificed friendships for handball.
“The climax came when our opponents were awarded a penalty shot in one game.
I was poised to defend the goal.
Before I realized it, I had prayed to Jehovah to help me block the shot!
This incident made me realize how much my spirituality had suffered.
How did I regain it?
“I had seen our DVD Young People Ask ​ — What Will I Do With My Life?
* I decided to watch it again and this time to take it seriously.
After all, I was in the same predicament as André, the young man in the drama.
I especially took note of what an elder had suggested that André do ​ — read and reflect on Philippians 3: 8.
That did it. I quit the team.
“What a difference that made!
My competitive spirit and the accompanying stress disappeared.
I felt happier and closer to my Christian friends.
Spiritual activities took on greater meaning.
I concentrated at the meetings and enjoyed them again.
My ministry also improved.
Now I regularly serve as an auxiliary pioneer. ”
If a distraction is tugging at you to disregard the sign Jesus gave us, take serious steps, as Arielle did.
You might try some of the following.
Consult the Watch Tower Publications Index, which has been called a map to hidden treasures.
References to sound counsel and first - person reports on how others have faced temptations await you.
Benefit fully from Christian meetings by preparing well and taking notes.
Some have found that sitting near the front of the auditorium is helpful.
When there is audience participation, try to give a comment early.
In addition, keep spiritually awake by matching up current news items with aspects of the sign and other characteristics of “the last days. ” ​ — 2 Tim.
3: 1 - 5; 2 Pet. 3: 3, 4; Rev.
6: 1 - 8. “Prove Yourselves Ready ”
The sign of the last days is international, comprising “all the inhabited earth. ”
Millions live in areas hard hit by pestilences, food shortages, earthquakes, and other foretold events.
In contrast, many others dwell in relative peace and quiet.
If you have never personally experienced some aspects of the sign, should you reason that the great tribulation is still a long way off? That would not be wise.
Reflect, for example, on what Jesus foretold about “pestilences and food shortages. ”
First, he did not say that these would affect all areas simultaneously or to the same degree.
Rather, he stated that these would occur “in one place after another. ”
So we cannot expect the same events everywhere at the same time.
Second, shortly after mentioning food shortages, Jesus indicated that some of his followers would have to be alert not to overeat: “Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating. ”
Thus, all Christians should not expect to experience every aspect of the sign.
Rather, Jesus stated: “When you see these things occurring, know that the kingdom of God is near. ”
Modern communication allows us to see all aspects of the sign, no matter what we personally experience in our locality.
Remember, too, that Jehovah has already set the “day and hour ” for the great tribulation to begin.
The progression of events on earth will not alter this date.
Jesus admonished Christians everywhere: “Prove yourselves ready. ”
We should always be ready.
Of course, we cannot engage in theocratic activities all day long every day.
Besides, none of us know what we will be doing the moment the great tribulation begins. Some may be working in a field or caring for domestic chores.
So, what can we do to prove ourselves ready?
Emmanuel, Victorine, and their six daughters live in an area of Africa where they do not feel the full thrust of all the events marking the sign.
So they decided to have a spiritual discussion every day to help prove themselves ready.
Emmanuel explains: “It was difficult to find a time convenient to all.
We finally chose the half hour between six and six - thirty in the morning.
After considering the day’s text, we prepare a few paragraphs in one of the publications scheduled for congregation study during the week. ”
Has this program helped them to stay awake? Indeed!
Emmanuel is coordinator of the body of elders in the congregation.
Victorine often serves as an auxiliary pioneer and has helped many to accept the truth. Their daughters are all progressing well spiritually.
Jesus admonishes us: “Keep looking, keep awake. ”
Do not allow a distraction to diminish your spiritual alertness.
Rather, take note of the fine counsel in our publications and at congregation meetings, as Arielle did.
Like Emmanuel’s family, try to do something every day to prove yourself ready and “keep on the watch. ”
A modern - day drama about a Christian youth’s struggle to do what is right in Jehovah’s eyes.

Daily spiritual discussions help Emmanuel and his family to ‘ prove themselves ready ’
Let Us Rejoice Together!
HAPPINESS and joy are increasingly difficult to attain.
For many, sharing positive sentiments with others seems almost impossible.
Modern - day life, especially in big cities, causes people to withdraw into themselves and become isolated.
“Loneliness is a very common condition, ” says Professor of Psychobiology Alberto Oliverio, and“ there is no doubt that life in large built - up areas facilitates isolation.
In many situations, it causes us to ignore the personal life of an office colleague, a neighbor, or the checkout clerk who works at the neighborhood supermarket. ”
Such isolation often leads to depression.
The situation of fellow Christians, however, is different, and so is their spirit.
The apostle Paul wrote: “Always be rejoicing. ”
There are many reasons for us to be joyful and to rejoice together.
We worship the Most High God, Jehovah; we understand the Bible’s message of truth; we have the hope of salvation and eternal life; and we can also help others to attain the same blessings. ​ — Ps.
106: 4, 5; Jer.
15: 16; Rom.
12: 12.
Rejoicing and sharing one’s joy are characteristics of true Christians.
So it is not surprising that Paul wrote to the Philippians: “I am glad and I rejoice with all of you.
Now in the same way you yourselves also be glad and rejoice with me. ”
Here, in the space of just a few words, Paul twice speaks of being glad and rejoicing with one another.
Christians, of course, need to be careful to avoid any tendency to isolate themselves.
No one who cuts himself off can rejoice with fellow believers.
So how can we follow Paul’s exhortation to “continue rejoicing in the Lord ” with our brothers? ​ — Phil.
3: 1. Rejoice With Fellow Believers
When Paul wrote his letter to the Philippians, he was probably a prisoner in Rome as a result of his preaching activities.
Yet, imprisonment did not dampen his enthusiasm for the ministry.
On the contrary, he rejoiced to serve Jehovah to the fullest extent possible and to be “poured out like a drink offering. ”
Paul’s attitude shows that joy does not depend on one’s circumstances.
Despite confinement, he said: “I will also keep on rejoicing. ” ​ — Phil. 1: 18.
Paul had established the congregation in Philippi and felt particular affection for his brothers there.
He knew that sharing the joy he found in serving Jehovah would be encouraging for them too.
Paul’s sharing this encouraging experience was one way of his being glad and rejoicing with his brothers.
The Philippians, in turn, must have rejoiced with Paul. Their doing so, however, required that they not become discouraged because of what Paul was experiencing.
The Philippians, moreover, could continue mentioning Paul in their prayers and providing him with whatever help and support they could. ​ — Phil.
1: 19; 4: 14 - 16. Do we show the same joyful spirit as Paul did?
Do we strive to see the positive aspects of our circumstances in life and of our Christian ministry?
When we are associating with our brothers, it is good to rejoice about the witnessing work.
We do not have to wait for sensational experiences to do this.
Maybe we were able to arouse interest in the Kingdom message with a particularly effective introduction or line of reasoning. Perhaps we had a good conversation with a householder about a selected Bible verse. Or it may simply have been that we were recognized in the territory as Jehovah’s Witnesses, and this alone turned out to be a fine witness.
Sharing such experiences is a way of rejoicing together.
Many of Jehovah’s people have made and are still making sacrifices to get the preaching work done.
Pioneers, traveling overseers, Bethelites, missionaries, and international servants expend themselves in full - time service and rejoice as they do so.
Do we feel glad and rejoice with them?
Then let us show our gratefulness for these dear “fellow workers for the kingdom of God. ”
When we are together at congregation meetings or larger Christian assemblies, we can warmly encourage them.
We can also imitate their zealous example. And we can create the “opportunity ” to listen to their experiences and upbuilding expressions by showing them hospitality, perhaps sharing a meal with them. ​ — Phil. 4: 10.
Rejoice With Those Facing Trials
Enduring persecution and overcoming trials strengthened Paul’s determination to stay faithful to Jehovah.
Knowing that the brothers in Philippi would likely face similar trials and would be encouraged by his perseverance gave him reason to be glad and to rejoice with them.
Thus, he wrote: “To you the privilege was given in behalf of Christ, not only to put your faith in him, but also to suffer in his behalf.
For you have the same struggle as you saw in my case and as you now hear about in my case. ” ​ — Phil.
1: 29, 30. Similarly today, Christians suffer opposition because of their witnessing.
Sometimes this opposition is violent, but often it is more subtle. It might come in the form of false accusations from apostates, hostility from family members, ridicule from colleagues or schoolmates.
Jesus warned that these trials should neither surprise us nor discourage us. Rather, they are reasons for rejoicing. He said: “Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake.
Rejoice and leap for joy, since your reward is great in the heavens. ” ​ — Matt.
5: 11, 12. We should not be scared or terrified when we hear that our brothers face harsh persecution in certain lands.
On the contrary, we should rejoice over their perseverance.
We can pray for them, asking Jehovah to sustain their faith and endurance.
While we may be able to do little else for those dear brothers, we can help the ones in our own congregation who are undergoing trials. We can take an interest in them and support them.
We can create opportunities to rejoice with them by occasionally inviting them to join us during our Family Worship evening, by sharing with them in the preaching work, and by spending time together in recreation.
We have many reasons for rejoicing together!
Let us resist this world’s isolationist spirit and continue to share our joy with our brothers.
By doing so, not only will we contribute to the love and unity of the congregation but we will enjoy the Christian brotherhood to the full.
Yes, “always rejoice in the Lord, ” for Paul urges us:“ Once more I will say, Rejoice! ” ​ — Phil.
4: 4. [Picture Credit Line on page 6]

Is Your Recreation Beneficial?
“Keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord. ” ​ — EPH.
5: 10. 1, 2. (a) How does God’s Word indicate that Jehovah wants us to enjoy life?
(b) Viewing recreation as a “gift of God ” will move us to do what?
THROUGHOUT the Bible, we find statements indicating that Jehovah wants us not only to live but also to enjoy life.
For instance, Psalm 104: 14, 15 states that Jehovah is causing “food to go forth from the earth, and wine that makes the heart of mortal man rejoice, to make the face shine with oil, and bread that sustains the very heart of mortal man. ”
Indeed, Jehovah makes crops grow to yield grain, oil, and wine for our sustenance.
But wine also ‘ makes the heart rejoice. ’
It goes beyond what is strictly necessary to maintain life and adds to our joy.
Yes, Jehovah wants us to be joyful, our hearts filled with “good cheer. ” ​ — Acts 14: 16, 17.
There is, therefore, no reason to feel guilty when we once in a while schedule some time to “observe intently the birds of heaven ” and“ the lilies of the field ” or to enjoy some other activities that refresh us and enrich our life.
A wholesome life is a “gift of God. ”
Viewing leisure time as part of that gift will move us to use it in a way that will bring pleasure to the Giver. *
Diversity and Limitations
Why is it reasonable to allow for diversity in recreation?
Those who have a balanced view of recreation allow for diversity yet also recognize the need for limitations.
Why so? To answer, let us compare entertainment with food.
Popular dishes differ from one part of the world to another.
In fact, what people in one area relish may be unappetizing to people elsewhere.
In a similar manner, what Christians in one part of the world view as pleasant recreation may not be appealing to Christians elsewhere.
Even among Christians living in the same area, what one may view as relaxing (perhaps curling up with a good book), another may view as boring; what one may view as refreshing (perhaps sightseeing on a bicycle), another may view as exhausting.
Still, we accept that in such matters as food and recreation, there is room for diversity and personal preference. ​ — Rom.
14: 2 - 4. Why do we need to set limits on the kind of recreation we choose? Illustrate.
However, we also realize that allowing for diversity in recreation is not a license to indulge oneself.
To illustrate, consider again the example of food.
Though we may be willing to eat a variety of foods, we would not deliberately consume food that is rotten.
Eating such food would go against common sense and could endanger our health.
Similarly, though we may be open to a variety of forms of wholesome entertainment, we would not pursue leisure activities that are life - threatening, violent, or morally rotten.
Engaging in such activities would go against Bible principles and would endanger our physical or spiritual health.
To make sure that we stay within reasonable limits, we do well to determine in advance whether some recreation that appeals to us is beneficial or not.
How can we do so?
How can we determine whether our recreation meets God’s standards?
For recreation to benefit us and be pleasing in Jehovah’s eyes, it needs to meet specific standards set out in God’s Word.
To determine whether that is the case regarding a type of recreation you may like, you might consult a simple checklist.
The list is made up of three questions that can be summed up in the words what, when, and who.
Let us consider them one at a time.
What Does It Include?
What entertainment do we need to reject, and why?
Before engaging in a form of entertainment, the first question to ask yourself is, What? ​ — that is, ‘ What is the nature of the leisure activity to which I feel attracted? ’
As you seek the answer, it is useful to keep in mind that there are basically two categories of entertainment.
What is the first? In this wicked world, much entertainment is characterized by activities that flagrantly violate Bible principles or break God’s laws.
True Christians say a resolute no to all such entertainment.
This includes entertainment that features sadism, demonism, homosexuality, pornography, or violence or that glorifies other vile, immoral practices.
7, 8.
How can we evaluate the quality of a certain form of entertainment?
The second category of leisure activity consists of forms of entertainment that do not center on practices that are expressly condemned in God’s Word.
In such cases, before choosing the entertainment, we should carefully compare the activity with Jehovah’s view of what is wholesome, as expressed in Bible principles.
Then we need to make a personal decision that leaves us with a good conscience.
How can we do so?
Think of this: Before eating a new dish, we would first want to find out what its main ingredients are.
For instance, you may like sports, and that attraction is easily understood.
Sports can be fun and exciting.
What, though, if you are attracted to certain sports because of their aggressive competitiveness, excessive risk taking, high rates of injury, riotous celebrations, nationalistic fervor, or similar “ingredients ”?
After examining what is involved, you would likely decide that it would be hard to harmonize your thinking with Jehovah’s way of thinking and with the message of peace and love that we preach to others.
On the other hand, if a certain leisure activity is made up of “ingredients ” that are wholesome in Jehovah’s eyes, then such recreation may well be beneficial and refreshing to you. ​ — Gal. 5: 22, 23; read Philippians 4: 8.
When Do I Pursue It?
What is revealed by our answer to the question, ‘ When will I engage in recreation? ’ The second question to ask yourself is, When? ​ — that is, ‘ When will I engage in recreation?
How much time will I spend on it? ’
Our answer to the question what?
reveals much about our inclinations ​ — what we find acceptable and what we find unacceptable.
However, the answer to the question when?
reflects our priorities ​ — what we find important and what we find unimportant.
How, then, can we determine whether the level of importance that we attach to our entertainment is proper?
10, 11.
How do Jesus ’ words recorded at Matthew 6: 33 help us in deciding how much time to spend on recreation?
Jesus Christ told his followers: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength. ”
Therefore, our love for Jehovah comes first in our life.
We demonstrate that this is the case by following Jesus ’ admonition: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you. ”
How can that statement help us in determining how much time and importance to assign to recreation?
Note this detail: Jesus admonished us to ‘ keep on seeking first the kingdom. ’
He did not tell us to ‘ keep on seeking only the kingdom. ’
Obviously, Jesus knew that we would need to seek many things in life in addition to the Kingdom.
We need housing, food, clothing, a basic education, employment, recreation, and the list goes on.
However, among all the things that we are seeking, only one pursuit comes first ​ — Kingdom interests.
That fundamental truth should move us to pursue our secondary activities, including recreation, in such a way that they enable us to carry out our primary activity ​ — caring for Kingdom interests.
If we do that, limited recreation can be beneficial. How can the principle found at Luke 14: 28 be applied to recreation?
So, then, when it comes to spending time on recreation, we do well to count the cost in advance.
We need to determine how much of our time a certain leisure activity will cost. Next, we must decide how much of our time it is worth.
If pursuing a form of recreation will mean neglecting such important activities as personal Bible study, family worship, attending Christian meetings, or sharing in Kingdom preaching, it is not worth the price.
But if an occasional leisure activity energizes us to keep on pursuing Kingdom interests, we may well decide that the time we spend on that type of recreation is worthwhile.
Who Are My Companions?
Why should we carefully consider with whom we share in recreation?
The third question to ask yourself is, Who? ​ — that is, ‘ Who are the ones I want to share my leisure activities with? ’
It is important to consider this aspect of recreation.
Why? Because the quality of our recreation is greatly influenced by the quality of our companions.
Just as eating a meal is usually more pleasurable when you do so in the company of good friends, engaging in recreation is often more enjoyable when you do so with good companions.
Thus, it is understandable that many among us, especially young ones, enjoy recreation that is shared with others.
However, to make sure that an activity will be beneficial, it is wise to determine in advance what sort of individuals to choose as companions and what sort to avoid. ​ — 2 Chron. 19: 2; read Proverbs 13: 20; Jas.
4: 4.
14, 15. (a) What example did Jesus set in choosing the right companions?
(b) What questions should we ask ourselves regarding our companions?
Following Jesus ’ example in choosing companions will be very helpful.
From creation onward, Jesus had a love for humans.
While on earth, he showed loving consideration for all kinds of people.
However, Jesus drew a line between being friendly and being a close friend.
While he was friendly toward people in general, he was a close friend only to those who met specific requirements. Speaking to his 11 faithful apostles, Jesus stated: “You are my friends if you do what I am commanding you. ”
The only individuals whom Jesus embraced as friends were those who followed him and served Jehovah.
Hence, when you consider whether you should choose a certain individual as a close friend or not, it would be wise to keep Jesus ’ statement in mind.
Ask yourself such questions as: ‘ Does this individual demonstrate in words and deeds that he is obeying the commands of Jehovah and Jesus?
Does he have the same Bible - based values and morals that I have?
Will being in his company encourage me to put the Kingdom first in my life and to be a loyal servant of Jehovah? ’
If you are sure that the answers to those questions are yes, you have found a good companion with whom to enjoy your leisure activities. ​ — Read Psalm 119: 63; 2 Cor.
6: 14; 2 Tim.
2: 22.
Our Recreation ​ — Does It Pass the Test?
What do we need to determine regarding our entertainment?
We briefly considered three aspects of entertainment ​ — quality, quantity, and company.
To be beneficial, our entertainment needs to match closely the Bible - based standard for each of these aspects.
Hence, before engaging in a form of recreation, we need to put it to the test.
When it comes to quality, we want to know: ‘ What does it include?
Is it wholesome or debased? ’
Regarding quantity, we want to find out: ‘ How much time would I spend on it?
Is the amount appropriate or not? ’
And concerning company, we need to determine: ‘ With whom will I share in entertainment?
9: 18; 1 Cor.
15: 33.
17, 18. (a) How can we test ourselves to see whether our entertainment meets the Bible’s standards?
(b) What are you personally determined to do when it comes to your choice of entertainment?
If a form of entertainment fails to meet the Bible - based standards in any one of these three aspects, it does not pass the test.
On the other hand, if we make sure that our leisure activities meet the Bible - based standards in all three aspects, our recreation will bring honor to Jehovah and benefits to us. ​ — Ps.
119: 33 - 35.
So, then, when it comes to recreation, let us strive to do the right thing at the right time and with the right people.
Yes, may it be the heartfelt desire of each one of us to follow the Bible’s advice: “Whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God’s glory. ” ​ — 1 Cor. 10: 31. [Footnote]
In this article, the terms “recreation ” and“ entertainment ” are used interchangeably to refer to the time we set aside for leisure activities that bring us pleasure.

Wise Counsel on Singleness and Marriage
“This I am saying... to move you to that which is becoming and that which means constant attendance upon the Lord without distraction. ” ​ — 1 COR. 7: 35.
1, 2.
Why should a person search out Bible counsel on singleness and marriage?
FEW aspects of life cause more elation, frustration, or worry than our dealings with the opposite sex.
The need to deal effectively with such emotions is reason enough for us to seek divine guidance, but there are other motives for doing so.
A Christian who is content with being single may feel that his family or friends are pressuring him to get married.
Another may want to get married but has not yet found a suitable mate.
Some need direction on how to prepare for the responsibilities of being a husband or a wife.
And both single and married Christians face tests regarding sexual morality.
Apart from our personal happiness, these issues affect our standing before Jehovah God.
In chapter 7 of his first letter to the Corinthians, Paul gave guidance on singleness and marriage.
His aim was to motivate his readers to “that which is becoming and that which means constant attendance upon the Lord without distraction. ”
As you consider his counsel on these important matters, try to see your situation ​ — single or married — ​ as a way to serve Jehovah more fully.
A Weighty Personal Decision
3, 4. (a) How do difficulties sometimes arise when people are overly concerned about an unmarried friend or relative?
(b) How should Paul’s counsel help a person to have a balanced view of marriage?
Like Jewish society in the first century, many cultures today emphasize marriage as being most desirable.
If a young man or woman passes a certain age without getting married, concerned friends and relatives may feel impelled to give him or her some advice.
In conversation, they may suggest that he or she search more actively for a mate.
They may drop hints about an eligible member of the opposite sex. They may even use cunning to get two unmarried people to meet.
These actions sometimes lead to embarrassment, broken friendships, and hurt feelings.
Paul never pressured others either to marry or to remain single.
He was content to serve Jehovah without a wife, but he respected the right of others to enjoy marriage.
Individual Christians today also have the right to decide for themselves whether to get married or to stay single.
Others should not pressure them to take one course or another.
Making a Success of Singleness
5, 6.
Why did Paul recommend singleness?
A notable feature of Paul’s words to the Corinthians is his positive view of singleness. (Read 1 Corinthians 7: 8.)
Although Paul was unmarried, he did not exalt himself over those who were married, as the celibate clergy of Christendom do.
Rather, the apostle highlighted an advantage that many unmarried ministers of the good news enjoy. What is that advantage?
A single Christian often has the flexibility to accept assignments in Jehovah’s service that might be out of reach for a married person.
Paul received a special privilege as “an apostle to the nations. ”
Read Acts chapters 13 through 20, and follow him and his fellow missionaries as they open up territories and establish congregations in one place after another.
In his service, Paul endured hardships that few today will face.
But his joy in helping many to become disciples made those difficulties worthwhile.
Would he have accomplished all that he did had he been married or had a family?
Probably not.
Give an example of unmarried Witnesses who have used their circumstances to further Kingdom interests.
Many unmarried Christians use their current circumstances to accomplish much in behalf of the Kingdom.
Sara and Limbania, single pioneers in Bolivia, moved to a village where the people had not received a witness for years.
Would the lack of electricity be a problem? They reported: “There is no radio or TV, so the people are not distracted from their main pastime, which is reading. ”
Some villagers showed the pioneers copies of publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses that they were still reading but that were long out of print.
Because the sisters found interest at almost every door, they had difficulty calling on every household in the territory.
One elderly woman told them: “The end must be near because Jehovah’s Witnesses have reached us at last. ”
Some in that village were soon attending congregation meetings.
8, 9. (a) What did Paul have in mind when he spoke favorably of singleness?
(b) What advantages do unmarried Christians have?
Of course, married Christians also have fine results when preaching the good news in challenging territories.
But some assignments open to single pioneers might prove difficult for those who are married or who have children.
Paul thought about the potential he observed for advancing the good news among the local congregations. He wanted all to have joy, as he did.
For that reason, he spoke favorably of serving Jehovah as a single person.
A single pioneer sister from the United States wrote: “Some people believe that happiness is unattainable for the unmarried.
But I have seen that lasting happiness depends on a person’s friendship with Jehovah.
Singleness, though it is a sacrifice, is an amazing gift if you take advantage of it. ”
Regarding finding happiness, she wrote: “Singleness can be a springboard to happiness, not a hindrance.
I know that Jehovah excludes no one, single or married, from his tender affections. ”
She now happily serves in a land where there is a greater need for Kingdom publishers. If you are single, can you use your freedom to expand your share in teaching others the truth?
You too may find singleness to be a priceless gift from Jehovah.
Single Ones Who Wish to Marry
10, 11.
How does Jehovah support those who hope to marry but have not yet found a suitable mate?
After spending some time single, many of Jehovah’s faithful servants decide to look for a marriage partner.
Conscious of the need for guidance, they ask Jehovah for help to find a suitable mate. ​ — Read 1 Corinthians 7: 36.
If you hope to marry someone who shares your desire to serve Jehovah whole - souled, keep this matter before Him in prayer.
Regardless of how long you may need to wait, do not despair.
Trust in our loving God as your Helper, and he will support you emotionally in harmony with your need. ​ — Heb.
13: 6. Why should a Christian weigh a proposal of marriage carefully?
A single Christian desiring to get married may receive a proposal from someone of doubtful spirituality or even from an unbeliever.
If that happens to you, remember that the heartache that results from making a bad choice in a marriage mate can cause greater pain by far than the longing that a person feels while single.
And once married, for better or for worse, you are bound to your mate for life.
Do not out of desperation make a decision to marry that you will later regret. ​ — Read 1 Corinthians 7: 39.
Prepare for the Realities of Marriage
13 - 15.
What possible sources of tribulation in marriage should a couple discuss during courtship?
Although Paul recommended serving Jehovah as a single person, he did not look down on those who decided to marry.
Rather, his inspired counsel assists couples to face the realities of married life and to make their union permanent.
Some couples need to adjust their expectations for the future.
As they court, two people may come to see their love as unique, extraordinary, a guarantee of marital bliss.
They enter marriage carried along by dreamy emotion and believe that nothing can ever destroy their happiness together.
Such thinking is unrealistic. The romantic aspects of married life are delightful, but they alone do not equip a bride and groom for the tribulation that comes with every marriage. ​ — Read 1 Corinthians 7: 28.
Many newlyweds are surprised, even disappointed, when their mates differ with them on important issues.
The two may find themselves at odds on how they should spend money and leisure time, where they will live, and how often they should visit the in - laws.
And each one has personality flaws that can irritate the other. During courtship, it is easy to make light of the importance of such matters, but they can later put great strain on a marriage.
A couple do well to resolve areas of concern before they marry.
Why should a couple agree on how to face the challenges of married life?
To be successful and happy, a couple must face their challenges unitedly.
They should agree on how to discipline their children and how to care for aging parents. The pressure caused by family difficulties should not push the two apart.
By applying Bible counsel, they will solve many problems, endure those that remain, and stay happy together. ​ — 1 Cor. 7: 10, 11.
What concern for “the things of the world ” should a couple expect to have?
Paul states another reality of marriage at 1 Corinthians 7: 32 - 34. (Read.)
Married people are by necessity “anxious for the things of the world, ” such as food, clothing, shelter, and other nonspiritual matters.
Why is this so?
When single, a brother may have poured himself into the ministry.
But as a husband, he finds that he must use some of that time and energy to care for his wife and thus gain her approval.
The same is true of the wife toward her husband.
In his wisdom, Jehovah recognizes this need.
He knows that a successful marriage often demands some of the time and energy that the husband and wife formerly used in His service when they were single.
What adjustments regarding social activities may some have to make after marriage?
But the lesson goes further.
If a couple must divert some time and energy from God’s service to care for each other, should they not do likewise with resources formerly used for socializing as single people?
What would be the effect on a wife if a husband remained deeply involved in sports with his friends?
Or how might a husband feel if a wife kept devoting much time to hobbies with her friends?
The neglected mate might soon feel lonely, unhappy, and unloved.
This can be avoided if those marrying do all they can to strengthen their bond as husband and wife. ​ — Eph.
5: 31. Jehovah Requires Moral Cleanness
19, 20. (a) Why are married people not free of temptation to be immoral?
(b) What risk does a married couple take if they allow themselves to be separated for long periods of time?
Servants of Jehovah are resolved to remain morally chaste.
Some decide to marry so as to avoid problems in this area.
Marriage, though, does not furnish automatic protection against sexual uncleanness.
In Bible times, a fortified city protected the people only if they remained inside its walls.
If a person went outside the gate when bandits and marauders were roaming about, he could be robbed or killed.
Likewise, married people find protection from immorality only if they stay within the sexual bounds that the Originator of marriage has established for them.
Paul described those bounds at 1 Corinthians 7: 2 - 5.
Sexual relations with her husband become the exclusive privilege of the wife; he likewise has the same privilege with her alone.
Each is expected to provide the other with the marital “due, ” or sexual relations that a married person has the right to receive.
However, some husbands and wives spend long periods of time apart ​ — taking separate vacations or being away from each other because of secular work, thus depriving each other of the “due. ”
Imagine the tragedy if because of the “lack of self - regulation, ” a person yields to satanic pressure and commits adultery.
Jehovah blesses family heads who provide for their families without risking their marriages. ​ — Ps.
37: 25.
Benefits of Obeying Bible Counsel
(a) Why are decisions on singleness and marriage difficult to make?
(b) Why is the counsel in 1 Corinthians chapter 7 useful?
Decisions involving singleness and marriage are among the most difficult that a person will ever make.
Imperfection, the source of most problems in human relations, is present in all people.
So even those favored and blessed by Jehovah cannot fully escape disappointment, whether single or married.
If you apply the wise counsel found in 1 Corinthians chapter 7, you can keep such problems to a minimum. In Jehovah’s eyes you will “do well, ” whether you are single or married. (Read 1 Corinthians 7: 37, 38.) Having God’s approval is the greatest goal that you can achieve.
With his favor, you will continue progressing toward life in his new world.
There, relationships between men and women will be free of the pressures so common today.
See The Secret of Family Happiness, chapter 2, paragraphs 16 - 19.

Trust in Jehovah, “the God of All Comfort ”
“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort. ” ​ — 2 COR.
1: 3. Regardless of age, what need do humans have?
FROM our birth on, we feel the need for comfort.
A baby uses its vocal cords to let us know when it needs comfort. Perhaps it wants to be held or it is hungry.
Even when we are older, we often feel the need to be comforted. Especially is this the case when we are experiencing difficult situations.
What assurance does Jehovah give that he will comfort those who trust in him?
Family members and friends can often give us a degree of comfort.
At times, however, conditions that cause us distress are beyond human remedies.
Only God can give us comfort regardless of how distressing our situation may be.
His Word assures us: “Jehovah is near to all those calling upon him,... and their cry for help he will hear. ”
Yes, “the eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous ones, and his ears are toward their cry for help. ”
But if we are to receive God’s support and comfort, we must place our trust in him.
The psalmist David made that clear when he sang: “Jehovah will become a secure height for anyone crushed, a secure height in times of distress.
And those knowing your name will trust in you, for you will certainly not leave those looking for you, O Jehovah. ” ​ — Ps.
9: 9, 10.
How did Jesus illustrate Jehovah’s love for His people?
Jehovah’s worshippers are precious to him.
Jesus made this clear when he said: “Five sparrows sell for two coins of small value, do they not?
But even the hairs of your heads are all numbered.
Have no fear; you are worth more than many sparrows. ”
Through the prophet Jeremiah, Jehovah told His ancient people: “With a love to time indefinite I have loved you.
That is why I have drawn you with loving - kindness. ” ​ — Jer.
31: 3.
Why can we trust in Jehovah’s promises?
Trusting in Jehovah and in the fulfillment of his promises can bring us comfort in times of distress.
We should therefore have the same trust in God as that expressed by Joshua, who declared: “Not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed.
They have all come true for you.
Not one word of them has failed. ” Moreover, we can be certain that even if we are temporarily crushed by trying situations, “God is faithful ” and will never forsake his loyal servants. ​ — Read 1 Corinthians 10: 13.
How is it possible for us to comfort others?
“To comfort ” means to soothe someone who is in distress or who is sorrowing.
This is done by easing his misery or grief and bringing him consolation. Jehovah certainly does this.
(Read 2 Corinthians 1: 3, 4.)
Our heavenly Father is not limited by anything or anyone and therefore has at his disposal whatever means are needed to provide comfort for those who love him.
In turn, we are able to comfort fellow believers “in any sort of tribulation. ”
We can do so “through the comfort with which we ourselves are being comforted by God. ”
How well this expresses Jehovah’s unmatched ability to comfort despairing ones!
Coping With the Causes of Distress
Give examples of things that can cause distress.
We need comfort in many areas of life.
One of the greatest causes of grief is the loss of a loved one in death, especially a beloved marriage mate or a child.
Comfort may also be needed because a person is a victim of discrimination or prejudice.
Poor health, advanced age, poverty, marital problems, or distressing world conditions can give rise to a personal need for comfort.
(a) In grievous situations, what kind of comfort is needed?
(b) What can Jehovah do to heal a “broken and crushed ” heart?
In times of distress, we may need comfort that soothes our heart, our mind, our emotions, and both our physical and spiritual health.
For example, consider the heart.
God’s Word acknowledges that our heart can be “broken and crushed. ”
Jehovah is certainly able to deal with this situation, for “he is healing the brokenhearted ones, and is binding up their painful spots. ”
Even in severe situations, God can bring relief to a stricken heart if we pray to him in full faith and observe his commandments. ​ — Read 1 John 3: 19 - 22; 5: 14, 15.
When we are distressed mentally, how can Jehovah help us?
Our mind often needs comfort because various trials can cause great mental distress.
In our own strength, we likely cannot cope with these tests of faith.
However, the psalmist sang: “When my disquieting thoughts became many inside of me, your own consolations began to fondle my soul. ”
Moreover, Paul wrote: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus. ”
Reading and meditating on the Scriptures can be of great help in coping with mental distress. ​ — 2 Tim.
3: 15 - 17. How can we cope with emotional distress?
At times, we may become so discouraged that we can be in danger of succumbing to the effects of negative emotions.
Perhaps we feel unable to care for a certain Scriptural responsibility or privilege of service.
Here, too, Jehovah can comfort and help us.
To illustrate: When Joshua was commissioned to lead the Israelites against powerful enemy nations, Moses told the people: “Be courageous and strong.
Do not be afraid or suffer a shock before them, because Jehovah your God is the one marching with you. He will neither desert you nor leave you entirely. ”
With Jehovah’s backing, Joshua was able to lead God’s people into the Promised Land and to victory over all their enemies.
Earlier at the Red Sea, Moses had experienced similar divine support. ​ — Ex.
14: 13, 14, 29 - 31.
If our physical health is affected by distress, what help can we receive?
Distressing events can have a negative effect on our physical health.
Of course, eating properly, getting sufficient rest and exercise, and keeping clean can have a good effect on us.
A spiritually healthy Bible - based outlook may well affect our body for the good.
Thus, it is helpful when going through some anguish that we bear in mind Paul’s experience and encouraging words: “We are pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; we are perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out; we are persecuted, but not left in the lurch; we are thrown down, but not destroyed. ” ​ — 2 Cor.
4: 8, 9. How can spiritual illness be counteracted?
Some trials can have a detrimental effect on our spiritual health.
Here, too, Jehovah can come to our rescue.
His Word assures us: “Jehovah is giving support to all who are falling, and is raising up all who are bowed down. ”
For help to counteract spiritual illness, we should seek the assistance of Christian elders.
And constantly keeping in mind the Scriptural hope of everlasting life can help to sustain us during tests of our faith. ​ — John 17: 3.
Examples of God - Given Comfort
Describe Jehovah’s comforting attitude toward Abraham.
An inspired psalmist declared: “Remember the word to your servant, for which you [Jehovah] have made me wait.
This is my comfort in my affliction, for your own saying has preserved me alive. ”
Today, we have Jehovah’s written Word, which contains many examples of God - given comfort.
For instance, Abraham may have been quite distressed when he learned that Jehovah was going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.
That faithful patriarch asked God: “Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked? ”
Jehovah comforted Abraham by assuring him that if only 50 righteous people could be found, He would not destroy Sodom.
Five more times, however, Abraham asked Jehovah: What if there are only 45 righteous people?
40? 30? 20? 10?
Each time, Jehovah very patiently and kindly assured Abraham that Sodom would be spared.
Although there were not even ten righteous people in the area, Jehovah did preserve Lot and his daughters. ​ — Gen.
18: 22 - 32; 19: 15, 16, 26.
How did Hannah show that she trusted in Jehovah?
Elkanah’s wife Hannah greatly desired to have a child.
But she was barren, and this distressed her.
She prayed to Jehovah about the matter, and High Priest Eli said to her: “May the God of Israel grant your petition. ”
This comforted Hannah, “and her face became self - concerned no more. ”
Hannah trusted in Jehovah, confidently leaving things in his hands.
Although she did not know what the outcome would be, Hannah experienced inner peace.
In time, Jehovah answered her prayer. She became pregnant and brought a son to birth, naming him Samuel. ​ — 1 Sam.
1: 20.
Why did David need comfort, and to whom did he turn?
King David of ancient Israel is another example of an individual comforted by God.
Inasmuch as Jehovah “sees what the heart is, ” when he selected David to be a future king of Israel, he knew that David was sincere and devoted to true worship.
Later, however, David committed adultery with Bath - sheba and tried to cover up the sin by having her husband killed.
When David came to realize the enormity of his sin, he prayed to Jehovah: “According to the abundance of your mercies wipe out my transgressions.
Thoroughly wash me from my error, and cleanse me even from my sin.
For my transgressions I myself know, and my sin is in front of me constantly. ”
David was truly repentant, and Jehovah forgave him.
However, David had to face the consequences of his wrongdoing.
Nevertheless, Jehovah’s mercy was a source of comfort to his humble servant.
What help did Jehovah give Jesus just before his death?
When on earth, Jesus faced many trying circumstances.
God permitted these tests of faith, and Jesus maintained his integrity as a perfect man who always trusted in Jehovah and upheld His sovereignty.
When about to be betrayed and executed, Jesus prayed to Jehovah: “Let, not my will, but yours take place. ”
An angel then appeared to Jesus and strengthened him.
God gave Jesus the comfort, strength, and support he needed at that time.
What can God do about distress we may experience if we face death as integrity keepers?
Even if we ourselves should face death because of our firm stand as Christians, Jehovah can and will help us to maintain our integrity to him.
Furthermore, we are comforted by the hope of the resurrection.
And how we look forward to the day when the last enemy, death, “is to be brought to nothing ”!
God’s loyal servants who have died, as well as others, are in Jehovah’s infallible memory and will be resurrected.
Confidence in Jehovah’s resurrection promise brings us comfort and a sure hope during times of persecution.
How can Jehovah comfort us when a loved one dies?
How comforting it is to know that our loved ones now asleep in mankind’s common grave have the prospect of resuming life in a wonderful new world free of all the present - day causes of distress!
And what a privilege it will be for the “great crowd ” of Jehovah’s servants who survive the end of this wicked system of things to welcome and instruct those resurrected to life on earth! ​ — Rev.
7: 9, 10.
Underneath Are God’s Eternal Arms
18, 19.
How have God’s servants been comforted when being persecuted?
In the words of a powerful and heartwarming song, Moses assured the people of Israel: “A hiding place is the God of ancient time, and underneath are the indefinitely lasting arms. ”
The prophet Samuel later told the Israelites: “Do not turn aside from following Jehovah, and you must serve Jehovah with all your heart....
Jehovah will not desert his people for the sake of his great name. ”
As long as we cling to Jehovah in true worship, he will never forsake us.
He will always give us the support we need.
God is unfailingly giving his people needed help and comfort in these critical last days.
For over a century, thousands of our fellow believers throughout the world have been persecuted and imprisoned just because they served Jehovah.
Their experiences prove that in times of trial, Jehovah does indeed comfort his servants.
For example, one of our brothers in the former Soviet Union was sentenced to 23 years in prison because of his faith. Even so, a way was found to get spiritual food to him so that he could be strengthened and comforted.
He stated: “During all those years, I learned to trust in Jehovah and received strength from him. ” ​ — Read 1 Peter 5: 6, 7.
Why can we be sure that Jehovah will not abandon us?
Regardless of what we may yet face, we will do well to bear in mind the psalmist’s comforting words: “Jehovah will not forsake his people. ”
Although we personally need to be comforted, we also have the grand privilege of bringing comfort to others.
As we shall see in the next article, we can have a share in comforting mourning ones in this troubled world.

“Comfort All the Mourning Ones ”
“Jehovah has anointed me... to comfort all the mourning ones. ” ​ — ISA.
61: 1, 2.
What did Jesus do for mourning ones, and why?
JESUS CHRIST said: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work. ”
In carrying out his God - given assignment, Jesus reflected his Father’s magnificent qualities.
Among these is Jehovah’s great love for people.
The apostle Paul noted one manifestation of that love when he described Jehovah as “the God of all comfort. ”
Jesus demonstrated such love when he did what was foretold in Isaiah’s prophecy. (Read Isaiah 61: 1, 2.)
Jesus read from that prophecy in the synagogue at Nazareth and applied its words to himself.
During his entire ministry, Jesus lovingly comforted mourning ones, bringing them encouragement and peace of mind.
2, 3.
Why do Christ’s followers need to imitate him in giving comfort?
All followers of Jesus need to imitate him by comforting those who mourn.
Paul said: “Keep comforting one another and building one another up. ”
Especially do we need to comfort others, since mankind now faces “critical times hard to deal with. ”
More and more, honesthearted people throughout the world are being confronted by some whose words and actions cause grief, heartache, and sadness.
As Bible prophecy foretold, in these last days of this wicked system of things, many are “lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self - assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self - control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God. ”
Such attitudes are now worse than ever, for ‘ wicked men and impostors have advanced from bad to worse. ’ ​ — 2 Tim. 3: 2 - 4, 13.
What has happened to world conditions in our time?
All of this should not surprise us, since God’s Word makes it clear that “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one. ”
“The whole world ” includes political, religious, and commercial elements, as well as propaganda channels.
Without question, Satan the Devil is properly called “the ruler of the world ” and“ the god of this system of things. ”
Conditions throughout the earth continue to deteriorate because Satan now has great anger, knowing he has only a short period of time left before Jehovah takes him out of the way.
How comforting it is to know that God’s toleration of Satan and his evil system will soon end, and the issue Satan raised regarding Jehovah’s sovereignty will be settled! ​ — Gen., chap.
3; Job, chap.
The Good News Is Being Preached Earth Wide
How is the prophecy about the preaching work being fulfilled in these last days?
During this difficult period of human history, what Jesus foretold is being fulfilled.
He said: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come. ”
This earth - wide witness work regarding God’s Kingdom is being done on an ever - increasing scale.
Today, over 7,500,000 Witnesses of Jehovah, associated with more than 107,000 congregations throughout the earth, are preaching about God’s Kingdom, even as Jesus made it the theme of his preaching and teaching.
As a result of our present - day preaching work, great comfort is being given to mourning ones.
Why, in two recent years, a total of 570,601 individuals were baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses!
What do you think about the scope of our preaching activity?
The great scope of this preaching work can best be appreciated by noting that Jehovah’s Witnesses now translate and distribute Bible literature in over 500 languages.
Nothing like this has ever been seen in all human history!
The existence, work, and growth of the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization are truly extraordinary.
Without the direction and help of God’s powerful holy spirit, it would be impossible for such a thing to take place in this world that is under Satan’s control.
Because the good news is being preached throughout the inhabited earth, comfort from the Scriptures is now being enjoyed not only by our fellow believers but also by mourning ones who accept the Kingdom message.
Comforting Fellow Worshippers
(a) Why can we not expect Jehovah to remove all distressing situations now?
(b) How do we know that it is possible for us to endure persecution and tribulation?
In this world full of wickedness and suffering, we are sure to encounter some situations that cause distress.
We cannot expect God to remove all sources of unhappiness or grief until he destroys this system of things.
Meanwhile, as we face foretold persecution, our integrity to Jehovah is at stake as supporters of his universal sovereignty.
Helped and comforted by our heavenly Father, however, we can be like anointed Christians of ancient Thessalonica, who bore persecutions and tribulations with endurance and faith. ​ — Read 2 Thessalonians 1: 3 - 5.
What Scriptural evidence is there that Jehovah comforts his servants?
There is no doubt that Jehovah provides needed comfort for his servants.
For instance, when the prophet Elijah’s life was threatened by wicked Queen Jezebel, that prophet lost courage and fled, even saying that he wanted to die.
But instead of rebuking Elijah, Jehovah comforted him and gave him the courage to carry out his work as a prophet.
That Jehovah comforts his people can also be seen in the experience of the first - century Christian congregation.
For instance, we read of a period when “the congregation throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria entered into a period of peace, being built up. ”
Moreover, “as it walked in the fear of Jehovah and in the comfort of the holy spirit it kept on multiplying. ”
How grateful we are that we too have “the comfort of the holy spirit ”!
Why can learning about Jesus be comforting to us?
As Christians, we have been comforted by learning about Jesus Christ and by walking in his footsteps.
Jesus said: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am mild - tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for your souls.
For my yoke is kindly and my load is light. ”
Learning about Jesus ’ upbuilding way of treating people and then following his positive example is in itself a great help in relieving the stress that we may experience.
10, 11.
In the congregation, who may be able to give comfort?
We can also be comforted by fellow Christians.
For example, consider how the elders in the congregation help those facing distressing situations.
The disciple James wrote: “Is there anyone [spiritually] sick among you?
Let him call the older men of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him. ”
With what result?
“The prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well, and Jehovah will raise him up. Also, if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him. ”
Other members of the congregation can provide comfort as well.
Women often find it easier to talk to other women about various problems.
These older, mature Christian women may already have gone through similar situations in their lives. Their sympathy and feminine qualities can be of much help.
(Read Titus 2: 3 - 5.)
Of course, elders and others can and should “speak consolingly to the depressed souls ” among us.
And it is good to bear in mind that God “comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those in any sort of tribulation. ” ​ — 2 Cor. 1: 4.
Why is it vital that we attend Christian meetings?
A very important means of being comforted is to be present at Christian meetings, where Bible discussions encourage us.
We read that Judas and Silas “encouraged the brothers with many a discourse and strengthened them. ”
Before and after our meetings, there is upbuilding conversation between members of the congregation.
Instead, we do well to follow the apostle Paul’s inspired counsel: “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near. ” ​ — Heb.
10: 24, 25.
Draw Comfort From God’s Word
13, 14.
Show how the Scriptures can comfort us.
Whether we are baptized Christians or are individuals just beginning to learn about God and his purposes, we can find great comfort in the written Word of God.
Paul wrote: “All the things that were written aforetime were written for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope. ”
The Holy Scriptures can comfort us and make us “fully competent, completely equipped for every good work. ”
Knowing the truth about God’s purposes and having a genuine hope for the future will certainly provide great comfort.
Let us, therefore, make full use of God’s Word and Bible - based publications that can comfort us and benefit us in many ways.
Jesus set us a fine example by using the Scriptures to instruct and comfort others.
During one of his postresurrection appearances, for instance, he ‘ fully opened up the Scriptures ’ to two of his disciples.
As he spoke to them, their hearts were deeply touched.
In keeping with Jesus ’ excellent example, the apostle Paul ‘ reasoned from the Scriptures. ’
In Beroea, his listeners “received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily. ”
How appropriate it is that we read the Bible daily, benefiting from it and from Christian publications designed to bring us comfort and hope in these troublesome times!
Additional Ways to Comfort Others
15, 16.
What are some things we can do to help and comfort fellow Christians?
We can help and thus comfort fellow Christians in various practical ways.
For instance, we might do some grocery shopping for elderly or sick fellow believers.
We might help others with their chores, thus showing personal interest in them.
Perhaps we can compliment fellow worshippers on their good qualities, such as their love, resourcefulness, courage, and faith.
In an effort to comfort the elderly, we can visit them and listen carefully to what they tell us about their past experiences and obvious blessings in Jehovah’s service.
Why, this may actually encourage and comfort us!
We might read the Bible or our Bible - based publications with those we visit.
Perhaps we could consider the current article for the weekly Watchtower Study or the material that will be covered during the Congregation Bible Study for the week.
We might join them in watching a DVD on a Scriptural theme. Then, too, we might read or relate some encouraging experiences found in our publications.
17, 18.
As Jehovah’s loyal servants, why can we be sure that he will support and comfort us?
If we notice that a fellow worshipper of Jehovah is in need of comfort, we can mention him or her in our private prayers.
As we personally cope with life’s problems and diligently seek to comfort others, we can have the same faith and conviction as did the psalmist who sang: “Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you.
Never will he allow the righteous one to totter. ”
Indeed, Jehovah will always be there to comfort and support us as his loyal servants.
God told his worshippers of ancient times: “I ​ — I myself am the One that is comforting you people. ”
Jehovah will do the same for us and will bless our good deeds and words as we comfort mourning ones.
Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly, each of us can be comforted by Paul’s words to his spirit - anointed fellow Christians: “May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and gave everlasting comfort and good hope by means of undeserved kindness, comfort your hearts and make you firm in every good deed and word. ” ​ — 2 Thess.

Questions From Readers
What should I do when I have a question about something I read in the Bible or when I need advice about a personal problem?
Proverbs 2: 1 - 5 urges each of us to “keep searching for ” understanding and discernment as though we were looking for“ hid treasures. ”
This implies that we should exert ourselves in researching answers to our Bible questions and in finding solutions to our personal problems.
How can we do this?
Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education, pages 33 through 38, analyzes “How to Do Research ” by using the tools that have been provided by“ the faithful and discreet slave. ”
Page 36 explains how to use the Watch Tower Publications Index, each edition of which is divided into a subject index and a scripture index.
This makes it possible to search either by key words or by Bible verses, whereby you will find a list of references to consult.
Be patient in searching for the specific answer or direction that you need.
Remember, you are looking for “hid treasures, ” which takes time and effort.
Of course, there are some topics and scriptures that our publications have not specifically addressed.
And even where we have commented on a particular Bible text, we may not have dealt with the specific question that you have in mind.
Also, some Bible accounts raise questions because not all the details are spelled out in the Scriptures.
Thus, we cannot find immediate answers to every question that arises.
In such a case, we should avoid speculating about things that simply cannot be answered, lest we get involved in debating “questions for research rather than a dispensing of anything by God in connection with faith. ”
Neither the branch office nor world headquarters is in a position to analyze and answer all such questions that have not been considered in our literature.
We can be satisfied that the Bible provides sufficient information to guide us through life but also omits enough details so as to require us to have strong faith in its divine Author. ​ — See pages 185 to 187 of the book Draw Close to Jehovah.
What if you have done all you can to search out a matter that affects you personally but still have not found the direction or solution you need?
Feel free to approach a mature fellow believer, perhaps one of the local elders.
They have considerable Bible knowledge as well as experience in Christian living.
Their balanced help would be especially fitting if you need advice about a personal problem or decision, for they know you and are close to you and your situation.
And never forget to pray to Jehovah specifically about your concerns and ask him to guide your thinking by means of his holy spirit, “for Jehovah himself gives wisdom... and discernment. ” ​ — Prov.
2: 6; Luke 11: 13.
Serving Jehovah Has Been My Delight
As told by Fred Rusk
I experienced early in life the truth of David’s words found at Psalm 27: 10: “In case my own father and my own mother did leave me, even Jehovah himself would take me up. ”
Let me relate how this came true for me.
I GREW UP on my grandfather’s cotton farm in the state of Georgia, U.S.A., during the Great Depression of the 1930 ’ s.
My father, who was devastated by the death of my mother and newborn brother, left me with his widowed dad and moved to a distant city for employment.
Later, he made attempts to have me join him, but these never worked out.
Grandfather’s older daughters managed the household.
Although he was not a religious man, his daughters were strict Southern Baptists.
Under threat of a beating, I was forced to attend church every Sunday.
So from an early age, I had little regard for religion.
I did, however, enjoy school and sports.
The Visit That Changed My Life
One afternoon in 1941, when I was 15, an elderly man and his wife came to our home.
He was introduced as “your uncle Talmadge Rusk. ”
I had never heard of him but learned that he and his wife were Jehovah’s Witnesses.
What he explained about God’s purpose for humans to live on the earth forever was much different from what I had heard in church.
Most of the family rejected ​ — even despised — ​ what they said.
They were never again allowed into the home.
However, my aunt Mary, only three years older than me, accepted a Bible along with publications that helped to explain it.
Mary was quickly convinced that she had found Bible truth and was baptized in 1942 as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
She also experienced what Jesus had foretold, namely: “A man’s enemies will be persons of his own household. ”
Family opposition was intense. An older sister, prominent in county affairs, conspired with the mayor and had Uncle Talmadge arrested.
The charge was peddling without a license.
He was convicted. Our hometown newspaper reported that the mayor, who was also the judge, said to those in the city court: “The literature this man is distributing... is as dangerous as poison. ”
My uncle won the case on appeal, but he spent ten days in jail in the meantime.
How Aunt Mary Helped Me
In addition to speaking to me about her newfound beliefs, Mary began witnessing to the neighbors.
I went with her on a Bible study that she conducted with a man who had accepted the book The New World.
* His wife said that her husband had stayed up all night reading it.
Although I did not want to be quickly drawn into anything religious, what I was learning appealed to me.
However, it was not primarily Bible teachings that convinced me that the Witnesses were God’s people.
It was how they were treated.
For example, on the way home from hoeing tomatoes one day, Mary and I found evidence in the smoldering incinerator that her sisters had burned her literature, including a phonograph and records containing Bible messages.
My outrage was met with the condescending response of an aunt, “You will thank us later in life for what we have done. ”
Mary was forced to leave home in 1943 because she refused to give up her newfound faith and stop preaching to the neighbors.
By then, I was thrilled to have learned that not only does God have a name, Jehovah, but he is a loving, compassionate God, not one who burns people in a fiery hell.
I also learned that Jehovah has a loving organization, although I had not yet attended a meeting.
Later, while I was mowing the lawn, a car drove up slowly and one of the two men inside asked me if I was Fred.
When I found out that they were Witnesses, I said, “Let me get in, and we will drive to a safe place to talk. ”
Mary had arranged for them to call on me.
One of the men was Shield Toutjian, a traveling minister who provided me with encouragement and spiritual direction at the right time. Family opposition now focused on me as I defended the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Right away I decided to go. On a Friday evening in October 1943, I put some necessities in a box and tied it in a tree some distance from home.
On Saturday, I retrieved the box, took a back route to a neighbor’s house, and got a ride into town.
Traveling to the city of Roanoke, I found Mary in the home of Edna Fowlkes.
Spiritual Growth, Baptism, Bethel
Edna was a compassionate anointed Witness ​ — a modern - day Lydia — ​ who had rented a large home and taken in, besides Aunt Mary, the wife of Edna’s brother, as well as her two daughters.
These girls ​ — Gladys and Grace Gregory — ​ later became missionaries.
Gladys, now in her 90 ’ s, still serves faithfully at the Japan branch.
While living in Edna’s home, I attended meetings regularly and received training in the ministry.
Having the freedom to study God’s Word and attend Christian meetings satisfied my growing spiritual appetite.
On June 14, 1944, I was baptized.
Mary and the Gregory sisters began pioneering and accepted an assignment in northern Virginia.
There they were instrumental in forming a congregation in Leesburg.
In early 1946, I began pioneering in an adjacent county.
That summer we traveled together to the memorable international convention held in Cleveland, Ohio, August 4 - 11.
At that convention, Nathan Knorr, who was taking the lead in the organization, outlined plans for expansion at Brooklyn Bethel. These included building a new residence and an addition to the printery.
Many young brothers were needed. I decided that that is where I would like to serve Jehovah.
So I turned in my application, and within a few months, on December 1, 1946, I went to Bethel.
About a year later, the printery overseer, Max Larson, stopped at my desk in the Mailing Department.
He informed me that I was being assigned to the Service Department.
J. (Bud) Sullivan, the department overseer.
My father visited me several times at Bethel. In later life, he had become religious.
On his last visit, in 1965, he said, “You may come to visit me, but I will never come to see you here again. ”
I did visit him a few times before he died.
He was sure he was going to heaven. My hope is that he is in Jehovah’s memory, and if so, at resurrection time he will be, not where he thought he would be, but here on the earth with the hope of living forever in the restored Paradise.
Other Memorable Conventions and Construction
Conventions were always milestones of spiritual growth.
The international ones at New York’s Yankee Stadium in the 1950 ’ s were especially so.
During one session in 1958, Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds were packed with 253,922 from 123 lands.
One incident at that convention, I will never forget.
While I was assisting in the convention office, Brother Knorr approached me at a fast pace.
“Fred, ” he said,“ somehow I overlooked assigning a brother to speak to all the pioneers now assembled in a rented banquet hall nearby.
Would you rush over and give them a good talk based on what you think about on the way? ”
I prayed a lot before I arrived there, out of breath.
As the number of congregations increased dramatically in New York City in the 1950 ’ s and 1960 ’ s, rented facilities for Kingdom Halls became inadequate.
So from 1970 to 1990, three buildings were purchased and remodeled in Manhattan to provide suitable meeting places.
I was chairman of the building committees for these projects and have many pleasant memories of how Jehovah richly blessed the congregations involved in working together to finance and complete these buildings that continue to serve so well as centers of true worship.
Changes in Life
One day in 1957, while I was walking to work through the park between the Bethel Home and the printery, it started to rain.
I saw a lovely blonde new Bethelite girl ahead of me.
She did not have an umbrella, so I offered to share mine.
That’s how I met Marjorie, and since our wedding in 1960, we have been walking happily together in Jehovah’s service, rain or shine.
We celebrated our 50th year of marriage in September 2010.
We had hardly unpacked from our honeymoon when Brother Knorr told me that I had been assigned to be an instructor at Gilead School.
What a special privilege that was!
From 1961 to 1965, five longer classes were made up mainly of branch personnel who were given special training in branch management. In the fall of 1965, classes returned to being five months in length, and once again the focus was on training missionaries.
In 1972, I was transferred from Gilead School to the Writing Correspondence Department, where I served as the overseer.
Doing research to handle a variety of questions and problems has helped me to understand better the teachings of God’s Word and the application of the lofty principles of our God in assisting others.
Then, in 1987, I was assigned to a new department called Hospital Information Services.
Seminars were arranged to teach elders on Hospital Liaison Committees how to approach doctors, judges, and social workers to discuss our Scriptural stand on blood.
A big problem was that doctors were arbitrarily giving blood transfusions to our children, often getting court orders to do so.
When alternatives to blood transfusions were suggested to doctors, the usual reply was that such were not available or were too expensive.
My response to a surgeon who said that would often be, “Hold out your hand, please. ”
When he did, I would say, “You know, you possess there one of the best alternatives to blood. ”
This compliment reminded him of what he was well - aware of ​ — that careful use of the scalpel keeps blood loss to a minimum.
During the past two decades, Jehovah has richly blessed these efforts to educate doctors and judges. Their attitudes changed significantly when they came to understand our position better.
They learned that medical research proves that alternatives to blood are effective and that there are many cooperative doctors as well as hospitals to which a patient might be transferred.
Since 1996, Marjorie and I have been serving at the Watchtower Educational Center in Patterson, New York, located about 70 miles (110 km) north of Brooklyn.
Here I worked briefly in the Service Department and then for a time shared in teaching branch personnel and traveling overseers.
For the past 12 years, I have again served as the overseer of Writing Correspondence, which had been transferred from Brooklyn to Patterson.
Challenges of Old Age
Caring for my privileges of service at Bethel has become more difficult as I have reached my mid - 80 ’ s.
I have battled cancer for more than ten years.
I feel like Hezekiah, to whom Jehovah granted an extension of his life.
My wife too has failing health, and we work together to cope with her Alzheimer’s disease.
Marjorie has been a capable minister of Jehovah, a mentor to young ones, and a faithful helper and loyal companion to me.
She was always a good student of the Bible and a fine teacher of it, and many spiritual children keep in touch with us.
My aunt Mary died in March 2010 at 87.
She excelled as a teacher of God’s Word and helped others to take their stand for true worship. She spent many years in the full - time ministry.
I am very grateful to her for the part she played in helping me to learn the truth of God’s Word and to become like her, a servant of our loving God, Jehovah.
Mary is buried beside her husband, who earlier served as a missionary in Israel. I am confident that they are in Jehovah’s memory awaiting the resurrection.
As I look back over 67 years of serving Jehovah, I am thankful for the rich blessings I have received.
It has been my delight to do Jehovah’s will!
Having trusted in his undeserved kindness, I fervently hope to share in the promise of his Son: “Everyone that has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive many times more and will inherit everlasting life. ” ​ — Matt. 19: 29.

Together in 2008
Does the Answer Matter?
“I was ten years old when I began going out with boys. At first, we would hold hands and kiss.
Soon, though, we were touching intimate body parts and experimenting with various sexual activities. When I was 15, I started working and was approached by men on the job who wanted to go all the way with sex.
I wanted to be daring and join my workmates in whatever they were doing.
I wanted my associates to accept me, which in turn led to more and more sexual experimentation. ” ​ — SARAH, * AUSTRALIA.
WOULD it surprise you to learn that Sarah was brought up in a religiously devout home?
Her parents tried to raise her to live by the Bible’s moral standards.
But Sarah chose a different course. Many would agree with Sarah’s choice.
They believe that the Bible’s view of sex is hopelessly out - of - date.
Others see no conflict between claiming to be religiously devout and pursuing a sexually permissive lifestyle.
Does it matter whether you know and live by what the Bible teaches about sex?
The Bible claims that it is “inspired of God and beneficial for teaching. ”
If you believe that God created humans and that the Bible is his inspired Word, then what it says on the subject is worth knowing.
Unfortunately, many are confused about what the Bible teaches concerning sex.
Religious leaders who claim to respect the Bible promote conflicting ideas.
In fact, the issue has divided many mainstream churches.
Rather than rely on what others say, why not take a few minutes to investigate the subject for yourself? The following article considers ten frequently asked questions about the Bible’s view of sex.
In that article you will find frank answers based on what the Bible really teaches.
The last article in this series will consider why the choices we make do matter.
Name has been changed.
Ten Questions About Sex Answered
1 Was sex the original sin that was committed by Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden?
▪ Answer: Many people are under the impression that the forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden represented sexual relations.
However, that is not what the Bible teaches.
Consider: Even before Eve was created, God commanded Adam not to eat the fruit of “the tree of the knowledge of good and bad. ”
Because Adam was alone, this prohibition could not have referred to sexual relations.
In addition, God gave Adam and Eve an unambiguous command to “be fruitful and become many and fill the earth. ”
Would a loving God instruct the first couple to “fill the earth ” ​ — which, of course, involved having sexual relations — ​ and then sentence them to death for obeying his instructions? ​ — 1 John 4: 8.
Furthermore, it was when Eve’s husband was not with her that she “began taking of [the forbidden] fruit and eating it.
Afterward she gave some also to her husband when with her and he began eating it. ” ​ — Genesis 3: 6.
Finally, Adam and Eve were not censured when they had relations and brought forth children.
Clearly, the fruit that Adam and Eve ate did not represent their having sexual relations but was literal fruit that grew on a tree.
2 Does the Bible prohibit sexual pleasure?
▪ Answer: The first book of the Bible reveals that it was God who created humans as both “male and female. ”
God declared his creation to be “very good. ”
Later, God inspired a Bible writer to give these instructions to husbands: “Rejoice with the wife of your youth...
Let her breasts intoxicate you at all times. ”
Do those statements sound as if the Bible prohibits sexual pleasure?
The facts show that in addition to making reproduction possible, God created the sexual organs in a way that allows a married couple to express their love and affection for each other in a mutually pleasurable way.
Such relations can fill the physical and emotional needs of a man and woman who are in a warm and intimate relationship.
3 Does the Bible approve of a man and a woman living together if they are not legally married?
▪ Answer: The Bible clearly states that “God will judge fornicators. ”
The Greek word for fornication, por·neiʹa, broadly refers to the misuse of the sexual organs of those who are not married to each other.
* Therefore, it would be wrong in God’s eyes for a couple to live together ​ — even if they intend to get married later.
Even if a couple are deeply in love, God still requires that they marry before enjoying sex.
It was God who created us with the capacity to love.
God’s primary quality is love.
4 Is polygamy acceptable?
▪ Answer: For a time, God did permit a man to have more than one wife.
But God did not originate the practice of polygamy.
He provided only one wife for Adam.
God authorized Jesus Christ to reinstitute His original standard of monogamy.
When asked about marriage, Jesus said: “He who created them from the beginning made them male and female and said, ‘ For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh. ’ ” ​ — Matthew 19: 4, 5.
One of Jesus ’ disciples was later inspired by God to write: “Let each man have his own wife and each woman have her own husband. ”
The Bible also states that any married man in the Christian congregation who is given special responsibilities must be “a husband of one wife. ” ​ — 1 Timothy 3: 2, 12.
5 Is it wrong for married couples to use contraceptives?
▪ Answer: Jesus did not command his followers to have children. Neither did any of Jesus ’ disciples issue any such directive. Nowhere does the Bible explicitly condemn birth control.
Married couples, therefore, are free to decide for themselves whether they will raise a family or not. They may also decide how many children they will have and when they will have them.
If a husband and wife choose to use a nonabortive form of contraception to avoid pregnancy, that is their personal decision and responsibility.
* No one should judge them. ​ — Romans 14: 4, 10 - 13.
6 Is it wrong to have an abortion?
▪ Answer: Life is sacred to God, and he views even an embryo as a distinct, living being.
God stated that a person would be called to account for injuring an unborn child.
So, in his eyes, killing an unborn child is murder. ​ — Exodus 20: 13; 21: 22, 23.
What, though, if an emergency situation at the time of childbirth forces a couple to choose between letting the mother live and the baby die or vice versa?
In that case, the couple would have to decide which life to try to save.
7 Does the Bible permit divorce?
▪ Answer: The Bible does permit divorce.
However, Jesus identified only one acceptable reason to end a marriage, stating: “Whoever divorces his wife, except on the ground of fornication [sex outside of the marriage], and marries another commits adultery. ” ​ — Matthew 19: 9.
God hates a deceitful, treacherous divorce.
He will personally hold accountable those who frivolously leave their mate, especially when they do so with the motive of taking another partner. ​ — Malachi 2: 13 - 16; Mark 10: 9.
8 Does God approve of homosexuality?
▪ Answer: The Bible clearly condemns fornication, which includes homosexual relations.
While the Bible is definite about God’s disapproval of that lifestyle, we also know that “God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life. ” ​ — John 3: 16.
Even though they do not condone homosexual relations, true Christians show kindness to all people.
God wants us to “honor men of all sorts. ”
Therefore, genuine Christians are not homophobic. ​ — 1 Peter 2: 17.
9 Is there anything wrong with phone sex, “sexting, ” or cybersex?
▪ Answer: Phone sex involves talking inappropriately about sex or listening to explicit erotic messages on the phone.
“Sexting ” is a term that refers to using cell phones to send erotic images and sexually explicit text messages to others.
Cybersex involves erotic interaction on the Internet.
The Bible does not specifically discuss modern practices such as these.
But it does say: “Let fornication and uncleanness of every sort or greediness not even be mentioned among you, just as it befits holy people; neither shameful conduct nor foolish talking nor obscene jesting, things which are not becoming. ”
Such things as phone sex, “sexting, ” and cybersex promote a distorted view of sex and encourage people to experience sexual pleasures outside the marriage arrangement.
Rather than help people control their sexual impulses, these practices promote selfish gratification.
10 What is the Bible’s view of masturbation?
▪ Answer: The Bible does not specifically mention masturbation ​ — the deliberate self - stimulation that produces sexual arousal and orgasm.
However, God’s Word commands Christians: “Deaden, therefore, your body members that are upon the earth as respects fornication, uncleanness, [and improper] sexual appetite. ” ​ — Colossians 3: 5.
Masturbation fosters a distorted and self - centered view of sex.
The Bible assures us that God can impart “power beyond what is normal ” to those who make a sincere effort to break this habit. ​ — 2 Corinthians 4: 7; Philippians 4: 13.
Por·neiʹa also refers to other acts that deviate from God’s original purpose in creating the human sexual organs, such as adultery, homosexuality, and bestiality.
For more information about the Scriptural view of sterilization, please see “Questions From Readers ” in The Watchtower of June 15, 1999, pages 27 - 28.
For a discussion of whether a rape victim would be justified in seeking an abortion, see Awake!
of May 22, 1993, pages 10 - 11, published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Why Live by Bible Standards?
IS THE Bible’s view regarding sex old - fashioned and needlessly restrictive?
On the contrary, the Bible’s view of sex can help us avoid:
▪ Sexually transmitted diseases
▪ Out - of - wedlock pregnancies
▪ The painful consequences of broken marriages
▪ A guilty conscience
▪ The degradation of being used by others
Our Creator, Jehovah God, * wants us to enjoy and benefit from the use of his gifts.
God is “the One teaching you to benefit yourself. ”
A person who lives by the Bible’s guidelines on sex gains:
▪ God’s approval
▪ Peace of mind
▪ Stronger family relationships
▪ A good reputation
▪ Self - respect
What, though, if you are not currently living by the Bible’s moral standards?
Is it possible for you to change your lifestyle?
Will God hold your past conduct against you?
Consider this fact: Some who made up the first - century Christian congregation were formerly fornicators, adulterers, and homosexuals.
They chose to change their lifestyle, and they reaped significant benefits.
Today, thousands of individuals throughout the world have made a similar choice.
They have freed themselves from a promiscuous lifestyle and have experienced the benefits of bringing their conduct into harmony with the Bible’s standards.
Note, for example, the experience of Sarah, mentioned in the opening article.
“I Quickly Felt Relief ”
Sarah discovered that her unrestrained lifestyle did not bring her the freedom and satisfaction for which she yearned.
“I felt that my conscience had become seared, ” she says.“ I was ashamed and worried that I might become pregnant or pick up a horrible disease.
I never lost my belief that God existed, and I knew that my course of life had hurt him.
I felt unclean, and it ate away at me. ”
Eventually, Sarah found the strength to change her lifestyle.
She sought the help of her parents, who are Jehovah’s Witnesses. She also asked for help from qualified Christian elders in the local congregation.
“I was pleasantly surprised by the warmth and love of my parents and the congregation elders, ” Sarah says.
“I quickly felt relief. ”
Now Sarah is raising two children of her own.
“I openly tell my children, ” says Sarah,“ about the choices I made.
I want them to understand how disregarding God’s standards affected me.
My goal is to help them appreciate the physical, mental, and emotional benefits of living by God’s standards regarding sex.
I am convinced that God gives us moral standards because he does not want to see us get hurt. ”
You too can experience the benefits of following God’s loving guidance.
The Bible makes this promise: “The orders from Jehovah are upright, causing the heart to rejoice; the commandment of Jehovah is clean, making the eyes shine....
In the keeping of them there is a large reward. ” ​ — Psalm 19: 8, 11.
Jehovah is God’s personal name as revealed in the Bible.

Keys to Family Happiness
Frederick *: “When we were first married, I insisted that my wife and I study the Bible together.
I was determined that she concentrate during our study sessions.
But Leanne just could not seem to sit still.
And when I asked questions, she gave only yes or no answers.
Her responses did not fit with how I felt a Bible study should be conducted. ”
Leanne: “I was 18 when I married Frederick.
We studied the Bible together regularly, but Frederick used each session as an opportunity to point out all my faults and the ways I needed to improve as a wife. I became so discouraged and hurt! ”
WHAT, do you think, was the problem with Frederick and Leanne’s relationship?
Their intentions were good.
They both loved God. And they both saw the need to study the Bible together.
But the very thing that could have helped to unite them seemed to have an opposite effect.
They may have been studying together, but they were not cultivating spirituality as a couple.
What is spirituality?
Why should married couples strive to cultivate it?
What challenges might they face, and how can they overcome them?
The word “spirituality ” as used in the Bible refers to an attitude or an approach to life.
The Bible writer Paul, for example, highlights the difference in attitude between a spiritual person and one who is fleshly.
Those with fleshly tendencies, Paul indicates, focus more on themselves than on others.
They do what is right in their own eyes, rather than trying to live up to God’s standards. ​ — 1 Corinthians 2: 14; Galatians 5: 19, 20.
By contrast, those with a spiritual attitude value God’s standards.
They view Jehovah God as their Friend and endeavor to imitate his personality.
Thus, they are loving, kind, and mild when dealing with others.
And they obey God even when it is inconvenient for them to do so.
“The way I understand it, ” says Darren, who lives in Canada and has been married for 35 years,“ a spiritual person always thinks about how his speech and actions will affect his friendship with God. ”
His wife, Jane, adds: “I think that a spiritual woman is one who works hard each day to make the fruitage of God’s spirit part of her personality. ” ​ — Galatians 5: 22, 23.
Of course, a person does not have to be married to develop a spiritual attitude.
In fact, the Bible teaches that each individual has the responsibility to learn about God and imitate him. ​ — Acts 17: 26, 27.
Why, then, should marriage mates strive to cultivate spirituality as a couple?
Consider this illustration: Two gardeners jointly own a garden plot and want to grow vegetables.
One decides to plant seeds at a certain time of year, whereas the other thinks that the seeds should be planted later.
One wants to use a particular type of fertilizer, but the other disagrees strongly and feels that the plants do not need any help.
One wants to toil in the garden each day. The other is happy to sit back and watch, rather than work.
In such a scenario, the garden may yield some results, but it will not produce as much as it would have if both gardeners had agreed on what to do and then worked together to achieve those goals.
A husband and wife are like those gardeners.
If just one partner cultivates spirituality, the relationship might improve.
Yet, how much better it is when both partners agree to live by God’s standards and work hard to support each other as they serve God!
“Two are better than one, ” wrote wise King Solomon.
“Because they have a good reward for their hard work.
For if one of them should fall, the other one can raise his partner up. ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 4: 9, 10.
You likely yearn to cultivate spirituality with your marriage mate.
But just as with gardening, desire alone will not yield results.
Consider two challenges you may face and how you might overcome them.
“My husband picks me up from work at 7: 00 p.m., ” says Sue, who has been married a short time.
“When we get home, all the chores are waiting for us.
It’s a struggle between mind and body; our minds tell us that we need to spend time learning about God together, but our bodies crave some rest. ”
A possible solution: Be adaptable and cooperative.
Sue says: “My husband and I decided to get up early and read and discuss a portion of the Bible together before going to work.
He also helps me with some of the chores so that I have time to spend with him. ”
What benefits come from making this extra effort?
Sue’s husband, Ed, says: “I’ve found that when Sue and I regularly discuss spiritual matters together, we cope more effectively with the problems we face and we manage our anxieties better. ”
In addition to talking to each other, it is vital that you spend a few minutes each day praying together.
How may that help?
“A little while ago, ” says Ryan, who has been married for 16 years,“ my wife and I went through a very difficult time in our relationship.
But we made time to pray together each night, expressing our concerns to God.
I feel that praying together helped us to resolve our problems and to regain joy in our marriage. ”
TRY THIS: Set aside just a few minutes at the end of each day to discuss any good things that happened to you as a couple, things you can thank God for.
Also talk about challenges you face, ones that you especially need God’s help to cope with.
Caution: Do not use this as an opportunity to list your mate’s faults.
Instead, when you pray together, mention only those issues that you need to work on together.
The next day, act in harmony with the requests you made in the prayer.
“I have never been one to sit down and read a book, ” says Tony.
His wife, Natalie, says: “I love to read, and I love to talk about what I’ve learned.
Sometimes I think Tony is a bit intimidated by me when we discuss Bible - based material. ”
A possible solution: Be supportive, not competitive or judgmental.
Complement and encourage your mate’s strengths.
“My wife’s enthusiasm for discussing Bible topics can be a little overwhelming at times, ” says Tony,“ and in the past I was reluctant to discuss spiritual subjects with her.
However, Natalie is very supportive.
Now we regularly discuss spiritual matters together, and I’ve discovered that there is nothing to be afraid of.
I enjoy talking about these topics with her.
It has helped us become more relaxed and at peace as a couple. ”
A word of caution, though: Apply any points of counsel to yourself, not to your mate.
Discuss contentious marital issues at another time, not during your study sessions.
Why not?
Consider this: If you were eating a meal with your family, would you choose that time to dress a festering wound?
You would ruin everyone’s appetite.
Jesus compared learning about and doing God’s will to eating food.
If you talk about emotional wounds each time you open the Bible, you could cause your mate to lose his or her spiritual appetite.
Certainly, you need to discuss problems.
But deal with those matters at a time set aside for that purpose. ​ — Proverbs 10: 19; 15: 23.
TRY THIS: Write down two or three qualities of your mate that you appreciate most.
When you next discuss spiritual matters related to those qualities, tell your mate how much you appreciate the way he or she displays them.
If you sow, or cultivate, spirituality as a couple, you will eventually reap a more peaceful and rewarding marriage.
In fact, God’s Word guarantees that “whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap. ” ​ — Galatians 6: 7.
Frederick and Leanne, quoted at the beginning of this article, learned the truth of that Bible principle.
They have now been married for 45 years and know that perseverance pays off.
“I used to blame my wife for the lack of communication, ” says Frederick.
“However, in time, I realized that I had to make an effort too. ”
Leanne says: “What really helped us through the difficult times was our mutual love of Jehovah God.
Throughout the years, we have regularly studied and prayed together.
As I see Frederick making an effort to improve in showing Christian qualities, it makes it easier for me to love him. ”
Names have been changed.
When was the last time we prayed together as a couple?
What could I do that would encourage my mate to be more open about discussing spiritual matters with me?

How Do God’s Laws Benefit Us?
This article raises questions you may have asked and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible.
Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.
Why should we obey God?
It is only right to obey God ​ — he created us.
Even Jesus always obeyed God.
God’s laws give us a way to prove that we love him. ​ — Read 1 John 5: 3.
All of Jehovah God’s laws are good for us.
They teach us the best way of life now and show how we can gain everlasting rewards in the future. ​ — Read Psalm 19: 7, 11; Isaiah 48: 17, 18.
How do God’s laws benefit our health?
God’s law against drunkenness protects us from deadly disease and accidents.
Overdrinking is addictive and leads to foolish conduct.
Jehovah allows us to drink alcohol but only in moderation. ​ — Read Psalm 104: 15; 1 Corinthians 6: 10.
Jehovah also warns us against jealousy, uncontrolled anger, and other destructive attitudes.
To the extent that we apply his advice, our health will benefit. ​ — Read Proverbs 14: 30; 22: 24, 25.
How can God’s law protect us?
God’s law forbids sex outside of marriage.
Couples who obey this law feel more secure and create a better environment for their children.
On the other hand, sex outside of marriage often results in disease, divorce, violence, emotional trauma, and one - parent families. ​ — Read Proverbs 5: 1 - 9.
By avoiding situations that tempt us to have sex outside of marriage, we protect our friendship with God.
We also avoid harming others. ​ — Read 1 Thessalonians 4: 3 - 6.
How does respect for life benefit us?
People who respect God’s gift of life enjoy health benefits when they drop such habits as smoking and other life - threatening addictions.
God treasures even the life of a baby developing in the womb.
So we should not deliberately kill an unborn child.
Also, those who appreciate God’s view of life take safety precautions at work, at home, and in a car.
In addition, they do not risk their life for sport, because life is a gift from God. ​ — Read Psalm 36: 9.
How does the sacredness of blood benefit us?
Blood is sacred because God says that it represents the life, or soul, of a creature.
God’s law, which equates the value of blood with that of life, benefits us.
It makes possible the forgiveness of sins. ​ — Read Leviticus 17: 11 - 13; Hebrews 9: 22.
Jesus ’ blood was especially precious because he was perfect.
Jesus presented to God something that represented his life ​ — his blood.
His shed blood makes everlasting life possible for us. ​ — Read Matthew 26: 28; John 3: 16.

Our Readers Ask...
Should Parents Teach Their Children About Sex?
▪ Many parents go to great lengths to protect their children from contracting harmful diseases.
Parents need to invest similar effort into protecting their children from harmful moral attitudes.
Such parental training and moral guidance is essential because children are increasingly being exposed to graphic sexual material on TV and the Internet, in books, and in comics.
“The problem today isn’t that our kids are learning about sex, ” explains Professor of education and author, Diane Levin.
“The problem is what they are learning, the age at which they’re learning it, and who is teaching them.
Children get a very powerful and damaging kind of sex education from marketers and the popular culture. ”
Parents need to protect their children from the distorted and immoral views that are corroding society.
Young children need to know how their bodies work, how to care for themselves physically, and how to protect themselves from immoral people.
Before puberty ​ — the age at which signs of sexual maturing begin to appear — ​ a daughter needs to know about the changes that will occur in her body and to understand why and how menstruation takes place.
Similarly, a boy should know in advance about nocturnal emissions, or wet dreams.
When children are little, parents can start teaching them the correct names for body parts.
Loving parents teach their children three key lessons about these body parts: (1) They are special and private.
(2) They are not to be discussed in a bad way. (3) They are generally not to be touched by or exposed to others.
As children grow older, parents need to discern when to explain how a woman becomes pregnant.
When should parents start such instruction?
A girl might first menstruate at the age of 10 or even earlier.
A boy might have his first nocturnal emission as early as the age of 11 or 12.
These life - altering events can be very disturbing if children do not understand what is happening.
Children need to be reassured ahead of time that there is nothing wrong with such natural developments in their bodies.
This is also the time to help them understand the value and importance of following the Bible’s moral standards ​ — something that most secular sex - education programs fail to provide. ​ — Proverbs 6: 27 - 35.
Parents can find helpful material on these subjects in the following publications produced by Jehovah’s Witnesses: Awake!
of May 2006, in the article “Preparing Your Daughter for Menarche, ” pages 10 - 13; Questions Young People Ask ​ — Answers That Work, Volume 2, chapter 6,“ What’s Happening to My Body? ”
; and The Watchtower of November 1, 2010, “Keys to Family Happiness ​ — Talk to Your Children About Sex, ” pages 12 - 14.

21 Questions From Readers
22 Do You Find Joy in “the Privilege of Kindly Giving ”?
“Do Not Lean Upon Your Own Understanding ”
“Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. ” ​ — PROV.
3: 5.
1, 2. (a) What situations may confront us?
(b) When dealing with distress, making a decision, or resisting a temptation, whom should we lean upon, and why?
CYNTHIA’S * employer has already shut down portions of his company and has laid off several employees.
Cynthia feels that she will be the next to be let go.
What will she do if she loses her job?
How will she pay her bills?
A Christian sister named Pamela wants to move where the need for Kingdom proclaimers is greater, but should she? A young man named Samuel has a concern of another sort.
He was exposed to pornography at an early age. Now in his 20 ’ s, Samuel has a strong temptation to go back to that habit.
How can he resist the pull?
Whom do you lean upon when facing distressing situations, making important decisions, or resisting temptations?
Do you rely solely on yourself, or do you “throw your burden upon Jehovah ”?
“The eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous ones, ” states the Bible,“ and his ears are toward their cry for help. ”
How important it is, then, that we trust in Jehovah with all our heart and that we do not lean upon our own understanding! ​ — Prov.
3: 5.
(a) What does trusting in Jehovah involve?
(b) Why may some be inclined to lean upon their own understanding?
Trusting in Jehovah with a complete heart involves doing things his way, according to his will.
Central to doing so is our continually approaching him in prayer and making heartfelt requests for his guidance.
However, leaning completely upon Jehovah presents a challenge for many.
For example, a Christian sister named Lynn admits, “Learning to put my complete confidence in Jehovah has been an ongoing struggle for me. ”
“I have no relationship with my father, ” she says,“ and I have a mother who did not care for me emotionally or physically.
So I very quickly learned to look after myself. ”
Lynn’s background made it difficult for her to trust anyone fully.
Personal ability and success can also cause a person to be self - reliant.
Relying on his experience, an elder may begin to care for matters involving the congregation without first approaching God in prayer.
What will be discussed in this article?
Jehovah expects us to make a sincere effort to live up to our prayers and to act in harmony with his will.
How, then, can we balance throwing our cares on him with putting forth personal effort to resolve difficult problems?
When it comes to making decisions, what caution must we exercise?
Why is prayer important when we are trying to resist temptations?
We will consider these questions by reflecting on Scriptural examples.
When in Distress
5, 6.
How did Hezekiah respond when he was threatened by the king of Assyria?
Concerning King Hezekiah of Judah, the Bible says: “He kept sticking to Jehovah.
He did not turn aside from following him, but he continued keeping his commandments that Jehovah had commanded Moses. ”
Yes, “in Jehovah the God of Israel he trusted. ”
How did Hezekiah respond when King Sennacherib of Assyria sent his representatives ​ — including Rabshakeh — ​ to Jerusalem along with a heavy military force?
The powerful Assyrian army had already seized a number of fortified cities of Judah, and Sennacherib had now set his eyes on Jerusalem.
Hezekiah went to the house of Jehovah and began praying: “O Jehovah our God, save us, please, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Jehovah, are God alone. ” ​ — 2 Ki.
19: 14 - 19.
Hezekiah acted in harmony with his prayer.
Even before going up to the temple to pray, he instructed the people not to respond to Rabshakeh’s taunts.
Hezekiah also sent a delegation to Isaiah the prophet, seeking his advice.
Hezekiah took steps that he could rightly take.
On this occasion, he did not try to work out a solution that was out of harmony with Jehovah’s will by seeking support from Egypt or from neighboring nations.
Rather than lean upon his own understanding, Hezekiah trusted in Jehovah.
After Jehovah’s angel struck down 185,000 of Sennacherib’s men, Sennacherib “pulled away ” and returned to Nineveh. ​ — 2 Ki.
19: 35, 36.
What comfort can we derive from the prayers of Hannah and Jonah?
Hannah, the wife of the Levite Elkanah, also leaned upon Jehovah when she was in distress over not being able to bear a child.
The prophet Jonah was delivered from the belly of a great fish after he prayed: “Out of my distress I called out to Jehovah, and he proceeded to answer me.
Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help.
You heard my voice. ”
How comforting it is to know that no matter how dire our situation is, we can call out to Jehovah with a “request for favor ”! ​ — Read Psalm 55: 1, 16.
8, 9.
What concerns were expressed in the prayers of Hezekiah, Hannah, and Jonah, and what do we learn from this?
The examples of Hezekiah, Hannah, and Jonah also teach us a vital lesson about what we should not fail to remember as we pray while under duress.
All three felt emotional pain when they were in sore straits.
Yet, their prayers show that they were not concerned about just themselves and getting relief from their problems.
God’s name, his worship, and the doing of his will were matters of utmost importance to them.
Hezekiah was pained that reproach was being heaped upon Jehovah’s name.
Hannah promised to give in service at the tabernacle in Shiloh the very son she had so desired.
And Jonah said: “What I have vowed, I will pay. ” ​ — Jonah 2: 9.
When we pray for deliverance from a troublesome situation, it is wise to examine our motives.
Are we concerned exclusively with getting relief from the problem, or do we keep Jehovah and his purpose in mind?
Personal suffering can easily cause us to get so caught up in our own situation that concern over spiritual matters fades into the background.
When praying to God for help, let us keep our mind focused on Jehovah, the sanctification of his name, and the vindication of his sovereignty.
Doing so can help us to maintain a positive outlook even if the solution that we hope for fails to materialize.
The answer to our prayers may be that we need to endure the situation with God’s help. ​ — Read Isaiah 40: 29; Philippians 4: 13.
When Making Decisions
10, 11.
What did Jehoshaphat do when confronted with a situation that he did not know how to handle?
How do you make weighty decisions in life?
Do you perhaps decide first and then pray to Jehovah to bless the decision you have made?
Consider what Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, did when the combined forces of the Moabites and the Ammonites came up against him to wage war.
Judah was in no position to take a stand against them.
What action was Jehoshaphat to take?
“Jehoshaphat became afraid and set his face to search for Jehovah, ” says the Bible.
He declared a fast for all Judah and collected the people together “to inquire of Jehovah. ”
Then he stood up in the congregation of Judah and of Jerusalem and prayed.
In part, he pleaded: “O our God, will you not execute judgment upon them?
For in us there is no power before this large crowd that is coming against us; and we ourselves do not know what we ought to do, but our eyes are toward you. ”
The true God heard Jehoshaphat’s prayer and provided a miraculous deliverance.
When making decisions, especially those that may affect our spirituality, should we not rely on Jehovah rather than lean upon our own understanding?
12, 13.
What example did King David set in making decisions?
What should we do when confronted with situations that may seem easier to resolve ​ — perhaps because past experience allows us to think of a solution quickly?
An account involving King David provides insight in this regard.
When the Amalekites raided the city of Ziklag, they carried off David’s wives and children as well as those of his men.
David inquired of Jehovah, saying: “Shall I chase after this marauder band? ”
Jehovah replied: “Go in chase, for you will without fail overtake them, and you will without fail make a deliverance. ”
David complied, and he “got to deliver all that the Amalekites had taken. ” ​ — 1 Sam.
30: 7 - 9, 18 - 20.
Sometime after the Amalekite raid, the Philistines came up against Israel.
David again inquired of Jehovah and received a clear answer. God said: “Go up, for I shall without fail give the Philistines into your hands. ”
Shortly thereafter, the Philistines once more came up against David.
What would he do this time?
He could have reasoned: ‘ I have faced a similar situation twice before.
Let me go up against God’s enemies, as I did then. ’
Or would David seek Jehovah’s direction?
David did not rely on his past experience. He again went to Jehovah in prayer.
How glad he must have been that he did!
The instructions he received this time were different.
When faced with a familiar situation or problem, we must exercise caution that we do not rely solely on past experience. ​ — Read Jeremiah 10: 23.
What lesson can we draw from the way that Joshua and the older men of Israel dealt with the Gibeonites?
Being imperfect, all of us ​ — even experienced elders — ​ need to be on guard against failing to look to Jehovah for direction when making decisions.
Consider how Moses ’ successor, Joshua, and the older men of Israel responded when approached by shrewd Gibeonites who disguised themselves and pretended to have come from a distant land.
Without inquiring of Jehovah, Joshua and others went ahead and made peace with the Gibeonites, concluding a covenant with them.
Even though Jehovah ultimately supported the agreement, he made sure that this failure to seek his direction was recorded in the Scriptures for our benefit. ​ — Josh.
9: 3 - 6, 14, 15.
When Struggling to Resist Temptations
Explain why prayer is important in resisting temptation.
Having “sin’s law ” within our members, we need to put up a strong fight against sinful inclinations.
This is a fight that can be won. How?
Jesus told his followers that prayer is vital in resisting temptation. (Read Luke 22: 40.)
Even if wrong desires or thoughts persist after we have prayed to God, we need to “keep on asking God ” for wisdom to cope with this trial.
We are assured that “he gives generously to all and without reproaching. ”
James also writes: “Is there anyone [spiritually] sick among you?
Let him call the older men of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him, greasing him with oil in the name of Jehovah.
And the prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well. ” ​ — Jas. 5: 14, 15.
16, 17.
When seeking help to resist temptation, when is the best time to pray?
Prayer is essential in resisting temptation, but we must be cognizant of the need to pray at the right time.
Consider the case of a certain young man mentioned at Proverbs 7: 6 - 23.
During the twilight hours, he is walking down a street where an immoral woman is known to live.
Misled by her persuasiveness and seduced by the smoothness of her lips, he goes after her, like a bull that comes to the slaughter.
Why had this young man gone there?
Since he was “in want of heart, ” that is, inexperienced, he was likely struggling with wrong desires.
When would prayer have benefited him the most?
Of course, praying to resist temptation at any time during his encounter would have been valuable. But the best time for him to pray would have been when he first had the idea of walking down that street.
Today, a man may be trying hard to resist viewing pornography.
However, suppose he were to visit Internet sites where he knows there are provocative pictures or videos.
Would not his case be similar to that of the young man referred to in Proverbs chapter 7?
To resist temptation to view pornography, a person needs to seek Jehovah’s help in prayer before starting to go down that route on the Internet.
18, 19. (a) Why can resisting temptation be challenging, but how can you meet the challenge successfully?
(b) What is your determination?
It is not easy to resist temptation or overcome bad habits.
“The flesh is against the spirit in its desire, ” wrote the apostle Paul,“ and the spirit against the flesh. ”
Therefore, “the very things that [we] would like to do [we] do not do. ”
To meet this challenge, we need to pray fervently when wrong thoughts or temptations first come to mind and then act in harmony with our prayers.
“No temptation has taken you except what is common to men, ” and with Jehovah’s help, we can remain faithful to him. ​ — 1 Cor.
10: 13.
Whether we are dealing with a difficult situation, making a weighty decision, or trying to resist temptation, Jehovah has given us a wonderful gift ​ — the precious provision of prayer.
By means of it, we demonstrate our reliance on him.
We should also keep on asking God for his holy spirit, which guides and strengthens us.
And by all means, let us trust in Jehovah and not lean upon our own understanding.
Names have been changed.

• How do the examples of David and Joshua emphasize the need for caution when making decisions?

In resisting temptation, when is prayer most beneficial?
For Life and Peace, Walk in Accord With the Spirit
“Walk, not in accord with the flesh, but in accord with the spirit. ” ​ — ROM. 8: 4.
1, 2. (a) What serious situation has resulted from a person’s being distracted while driving?
(b) What danger can result from being distracted spiritually?
“DISTRACTED driving is an epidemic and it seems to be getting worse every year. ”
That was the assessment of the U.S. secretary of transportation.
Cell phones are among the devices that can distract the motorist from the one thing he or she is supposed to be doing ​ — driving. Over one third of the people interviewed in one survey said that they had been hit or nearly hit by a vehicle with a driver using a cell phone.
Multitasking while driving may seem to be expedient, but the result can be disastrous.
The same could be true of our spiritual well - being.
Just as a distracted driver often fails to notice signs of danger, a person who is distracted spiritually can easily fall into harm’s way.
If we allow ourselves to drift away from our Christian course and theocratic activities, the result could be the shipwreck of our faith.
The apostle Paul warned of this danger when he cautioned his fellow Christians in Rome: “The minding of the flesh means death, but the minding of the spirit means life and peace. ”
What did Paul mean by that?
How can we avoid “the minding of the flesh ” and pursue“ the minding of the spirit ”?
They “Have No Condemnation ”
3, 4. (a) What personal struggle did Paul write about?
(b) Why should we be interested in Paul’s situation?
In his letter to the Romans, Paul wrote about a struggle he himself experienced ​ — a conflict between his flesh and his mind. (Read Romans 7: 21 - 23.)
Paul was not indulging in self - justification or self - pity, as though he were so heavily laden with sin that he could not help himself.
After all, he was a mature, spirit - anointed Christian, chosen to be “an apostle to the nations. ”
Why, then, did Paul write about his personal struggle?
Paul was honestly acknowledging that on his own, he was incapable of doing God’s will to the extent that he himself desired.
“All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, ” he said.
As a descendant of Adam, Paul was subject to the effects of sin on the imperfect flesh.
We can relate to him because all of us are imperfect and have to face similar struggles every day.
Moreover, there are many distractions that could divert our attention and take us off ‘ the cramped road leading into life. ’
However, the situation was not hopeless for Paul, and it is not for us.
Where did Paul find help and relief? Paul wrote: “Who will rescue me...?
Then, he addressed those “in union with Christ Jesus ” ​ — anointed Christians.
(Read Romans 8: 1, 2.)
By means of his holy spirit, Jehovah adopts them as sons, calling them to be “joint heirs with Christ. ”
God’s spirit, coupled with their faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice, enables them to come off victorious in the struggle that Paul described and thus “have no condemnation. ”
They are set free “from the law of sin and of death. ”
Why should all of God’s servants take note of Paul’s words?
While Paul’s remarks were addressed to anointed Christians, what he said about God’s spirit and Christ’s ransom sacrifice can benefit all servants of Jehovah regardless of the hope they entertain.
Although Paul was inspired to offer such counsel to anointed Christians, it is vital that all servants of God understand what he wrote and endeavor to benefit from it.
How God “Condemned Sin in the Flesh ”
7, 8. (a) In what sense was the Law “weak through the flesh ”?
(b) What has God accomplished by means of his spirit and the ransom?
In the 7th chapter of Romans, Paul acknowledged the power of sin on the imperfect flesh. In the 8th chapter, he commented on the power of holy spirit.
The apostle explained how God’s spirit can help Christians in their struggle against the power of sin so that they can live in harmony with Jehovah’s will and gain his approval.
Paul pointed out that by means of God’s spirit and the ransom sacrifice of his Son, God has accomplished something that the Mosaic Law could not.
The Law, with its many commandments, condemned sinners.
Moreover, Israel’s high priests serving under the Law were imperfect and could not offer an adequate sacrifice for sin.
Hence, the Law was “weak through the flesh. ”
But “by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh ” and offering him as a ransom, God“ condemned sin in the flesh, ” thus overcoming the “incapability on the part of the Law. ”
As a result, anointed Christians are counted righteous on the basis of their faith in Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice.
They are urged to “walk, not in accord with the flesh, but in accord with the spirit. ” (Read Romans 8: 3, 4.)
Indeed, they must do so faithfully to the end of their earthly course in order to be granted “the crown of life. ” ​ — Rev. 2: 10.
What is the meaning of the word “law ” as used at Romans 8: 2?
In addition to “the Law, ” Paul mentioned“ the law of that spirit ” and “the law of sin and of death. ”
What are these laws?
The word “law ” here does not refer to certain rules, such as those in the Mosaic Law.
One reference work suggests: “The Greek term for law here means an inward principle of action ​ — either good or evil — ​ operating with the regularity of a law. The term also designates a standard for a person’s life. ”
How are we subject to the law of sin and of death?
The apostle Paul wrote: “Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned. ”
As descendants of Adam, all of us are subject to the law of sin and of death.
Our sinful flesh constantly urges us to do things that are displeasing to God, with only death in view.
In his letter to the Galatians, Paul called such acts and traits “the works of the flesh. ”
Then he added: “Those who practice such things will not inherit God’s kingdom. ”
People of this kind are the same as those who walk in accord with the flesh.
Their “inward principle of action ” and their ‘ standard for life ’ are totally fleshly.
But are those who commit fornication, engage in idolatry, practice spiritism, or get involved in other gross sins the only ones who walk in accord with the flesh?
No, for the works of the flesh also include what some might consider mere personality flaws, such as jealousy, fits of anger, contentions, and envies.
Who can say that he has totally freed himself from walking in accord with the flesh?
11, 12.
What provision has Jehovah made to help us overcome the law of sin and of death, and what must we do to enjoy God’s favor?
How happy we can be that Jehovah has made it possible for us to overcome the law of sin and of death!
Jesus said: “God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life. ”
By accepting God’s love and by exercising faith in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, we can be freed from the condemnation resulting from our inherited sin.
We may, therefore, be inclined to exclaim, as did Paul: “Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! ”
Our situation is similar to being cured of a serious illness.
If we hope to recover fully, we must do what the doctor tells us to do.
Though exercising faith in the ransom can free us from the law of sin and of death, we are still imperfect and sinful.
More is involved in attaining good spiritual health and enjoying God’s favor and blessing.
In connection with fulfilling “the righteous requirement of the Law, ” Paul also brings out the matter of walking in accord with the spirit.
Walk in Accord With the Spirit ​ — How?
What does it mean to walk in accord with the spirit?
When we walk, we are moving progressively toward a certain destination or goal.
Thus, walking in accord with the spirit calls for steady spiritual advancement ​ — not spiritual perfection.
Day by day and to the best of our ability, we must endeavor to walk, or live our lives, in accord with the leading of the spirit.
“Walking by spirit ” leads to God’s approval. ​ — Gal. 5: 16.
What is the inclination of those “in accord with the flesh ”?
In his letter to the Romans, Paul next spoke of two kinds of people with conflicting mind - sets. (Read Romans 8: 5.)
Here the flesh is not necessarily the physical body.
In the Bible, the word “flesh ” is sometimes used to denote the sinful and imperfect nature of the fallen flesh.
This nature is what causes the conflict between the flesh and the mind that Paul mentioned earlier.
Unlike him, however, those who “are in accord with the flesh ” do not even put up a fight.
Instead of considering what God requires of them and accepting the help he has provided, they are inclined to “set their minds on the things of the flesh. ”
They often focus on the satisfying of their bodily comforts and physical desires.
In contrast, the inclination of those who are “in accord with the spirit ” is to set their minds on“ the things of the spirit ” ​ — spiritual provisions and activity.
15, 16. (a) How does setting one’s mind on something affect one’s mental attitude?
(b) What can we say about the mind - set of most people today?
Read Romans 8: 6.
To do anything ​ — whether it is good or bad — ​ one must set one’s mind on it.
People who constantly set their minds on the things of the flesh soon develop a mental attitude or inclination that is totally focused on the things of the flesh.
Their sentiments, interests, and affections usually become completely occupied with such things.
With what things are most people occupied today?
The apostle John wrote: “Everything in the world ​ — the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life — ​ does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world. ”
These desires involve such things as promiscuity, prominence, and possessions.
Books, magazines, newspapers, movies, TV shows, and the Internet are flooded with material of this sort, primarily because that is what most people set their minds on and really want.
“Because the minding of the flesh means enmity with God, for it is not under subjection to the law of God, nor, in fact, can it be.
So those who are in harmony with the flesh cannot please God. ” ​ — Rom. 8: 7, 8.
17, 18.
How can we pursue the minding of the spirit, and what will be the result of our doing so?
On the other hand, “the minding of the spirit means life and peace ” ​ — everlasting life in the future as well as inner peace and peace with God now.
How can we pursue “the minding of the spirit ”?
By regularly setting our minds on the things of the spirit and allowing a spiritual inclination and attitude to develop in us.
As we do this, we have a mind - set that is “under subjection to the law of God ” and is“ in harmony with ” his thoughts.
When we are faced with a temptation, we will not be uncertain about the course we should pursue. We will be moved to make the correct choice ​ — one that is in accord with the spirit.
Therefore, it is vital to set our minds on the things of the spirit.
We do this by ‘ bracing up our minds for activity, ’ building our life around a spiritual routine that includes regular prayer, Bible reading and study, meeting attendance, and the Christian ministry.
Rather than allowing the things of the flesh to distract us, let us set our minds on the things of the spirit.
Thus we will go on walking in accord with the spirit.
Doing so will bring us blessings, for the minding of the spirit means life and peace. ​ — Gal. 6: 7, 8.

• What is “the law of sin and of death, ” and how can we be freed from it?

“Temporary Residents ” in a Wicked World
“In faith all these... publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land. ” ​ — HEB.
11: 13. What did Jesus say about the position of his followers with regard to the world?
“THEY are in the world, ” said Jesus of his disciples.
But he explained: “They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world. ”
Thus, Jesus clearly indicated the position of his true followers with respect to “this system of things, ” whose god is Satan.
Although living in this wicked world, they would be no part of it.
Their situation in this system would be that of “aliens and temporary residents. ” ​ — 1 Pet. 2: 11.
They Lived as “Temporary Residents ”
2, 3.
Why can it be said that Enoch, Noah, and Abraham and Sarah lived as “strangers and temporary residents ”?
From earliest times, faithful servants of Jehovah stood out as different from those in the ungodly world in which they lived.
Before the Flood, Enoch and Noah “walked with the true God. ”
Both of them were courageous preachers of Jehovah’s judgments against Satan’s wicked world.
(Read 2 Peter 2: 5; Jude 14, 15.)
Because they walked with God in an ungodly world, Enoch “pleased God well ” and Noah“ proved himself faultless among his contemporaries. ” ​ — Heb.
11: 5; Gen.
6: 9. At God’s invitation, Abraham and Sarah gave up the comforts of city life in Ur of the Chaldeans and accepted the challenge of living as nomads in a foreign land.
The apostle Paul wrote: “By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed in going out into a place he was destined to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, although not knowing where he was going.
By faith he resided as an alien in the land of the promise as in a foreign land, and dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the very same promise. ”
Concerning such faithful servants of Jehovah, Paul said: “In faith all these died, although they did not get the fulfillment of the promises, but they saw them afar off and welcomed them and publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land. ” ​ — Heb.
11: 13. A Warning to the Israelites
What warning were the Israelites given before they became residents in their land?
Abraham’s descendants, the Israelites, became numerous and were eventually organized into a nation with a law code and a land.
The people of Israel were never to forget that the real Owner of their land was Jehovah.
They were like tenants obliged to respect the Owner’s wishes.
Moreover, they were to remember that “not by bread alone does man live ”; they were not to let material prosperity cause them to forget Jehovah.
Before settling in their land, the Israelites were given this warning: “It must occur that when Jehovah your God will bring you into the land that he swore to your forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to give you, great and good - looking cities that you did not build, and houses full of all good things and that you did not fill, and cisterns hewn out that you did not hew out, vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant, and you shall have eaten and become satisfied, watch out for yourself that you may not forget Jehovah. ” ​ — Deut.
6: 10 - 12.
Why did Jehovah reject Israel, and to what new nation did he transfer his favor?
This warning was not unfounded.
In Nehemiah’s day, a group of Levites recalled with shame what occurred after the Israelites took possession of the Promised Land.
After the people of Israel occupied comfortable houses and had an abundance of food and wine, “they began to eat and to be satisfied and to grow fat. ”
They rebelled against God, even killing the prophets he sent to warn them.
Jehovah therefore abandoned them to their enemies. (Read Nehemiah 9: 25 - 27; Hos.
13: 6 - 9) Later, under Roman domination, the faithless Jews went so far as to kill the promised Messiah!
Jehovah rejected them and transferred his favor to a new nation, spiritual Israel. ​ — Matt. 21: 43; Acts 7: 51, 52; Gal.
6: 16. “No Part of the World ”
6, 7. (a) How would you explain what Jesus said about the position of his followers with regard to the world?
(b) Why were true Christians not to become a part of Satan’s system?
As shown earlier in this article, the Head of the Christian congregation, Jesus Christ, made it clear that his followers would be separate from the world, Satan’s wicked system of things.
Shortly before his death, Jesus told his disciples: “If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own.
Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you. ” ​ — John 15: 19.
As Christianity spread, were Christians to come to terms with the world, conforming to its practices and becoming a part of it?
Wherever they lived, they were to distinguish themselves from Satan’s system.
Some 30 years after Christ’s death, the apostle Peter wrote to Christians living in different parts of the Roman world: “Beloved, I exhort you as aliens and temporary residents to keep abstaining from fleshly desires, which are the very ones that carry on a conflict against the soul.
Maintain your conduct fine among the nations. ” ​ — 1 Pet.
1: 1; 2: 11, 12. How did one historian describe the relationship of early Christians to the world?
Confirming that early Christians conducted themselves as “aliens and temporary residents ” in the Roman world, historian Kenneth Scott Latourette wrote:“ It is one of the commonplaces of history that in its first three centuries Christianity met persistent and often severe persecution...
The accusations varied.
Because they refused to participate in pagan ceremonies the Christians were dubbed atheists.
Through their abstention from much of the community life ​ — the pagan festivals, the public amusements which to Christians were shot through and through with pagan beliefs, practices, and immoralities — ​ they were derided as haters of the human race. ”
Not Using the World to the Full
As true Christians, how do we give proof that we are not “haters of the human race ”?
What is the situation today?
With regard to “the present wicked system of things, ” we maintain the same stance as did the early Christians.
Because of this, we are misunderstood by many and are even hated by some.
Yet, we certainly are not “haters of the human race. ”
Out of love for fellow humans, we go from house to house, making every effort to contact each occupant with the “good news of [God’s] kingdom. ”
We do this because we are convinced that Jehovah’s Kingdom government under Christ will shortly put an end to imperfect human rulership, replacing it with a righteous new system of things. ​ — Dan.
2: 44; 2 Pet.
3: 13.
10, 11. (a) How do we make limited use of the world?
(b) What are some ways in which vigilant Christians refrain from using the world to the full?
In view of the imminent end of the present system of things, as Jehovah’s servants we realize that this is no time to settle down in this dying world.
We heed the apostle Paul’s words: “This I say, brothers, the time left is reduced.
Henceforth let those... who buy [be] as those not possessing, and those making use of the world as those not using it to the full; for the scene of this world is changing. ”
But how do present - day Christians make use of the world?
They do this by using modern technology and means of communication to spread Bible knowledge worldwide in hundreds of languages.
They make limited use of the world to earn a living. They purchase necessary goods and services made available in the world.
However, they avoid using the world to the full in that they keep worldly possessions and occupations in the proper place. ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6: 9, 10.
Vigilant Christians refrain from using the world to the full with regard to higher education.
Many people in this world consider higher education an indispensable stepping - stone to prestige and an affluent life.
But we Christians live as temporary residents and pursue different goals.
We avoid “minding lofty things. ”
Since we are Jesus ’ followers, we heed his warning: “Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of covetousness, because even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses. ”
Consequently, young Christians are encouraged to pursue spiritual goals, getting only as much education as is required to meet their basic needs while focusing on preparing themselves to serve Jehovah ‘ with their whole heart, soul, strength, and mind. ’
By doing so, they can become “rich toward God. ” ​ — Luke 12: 21; read Matthew 6: 19 - 21.
Avoid Being Weighed Down by the Anxieties of Life
12, 13.
How does our heeding Jesus ’ words recorded at Matthew 6: 31 - 33 distinguish us from people in the world?
Jehovah’s servants differ from people of the world in their attitude toward material things. In this regard, Jesus told his followers: “Never be anxious and say, ‘ What are we to eat? ’ or, ‘ What are we to drink? ’
For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing.
For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things.
Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you. ”
From personal experience, many of our fellow believers have found that our heavenly Father supplies the things they need. “Godliness with contentment is great gain. ”
That is the very opposite of the viewpoint of people in today’s world.
For example, when young people get married, many of them expect to ‘ have it all ’ right away ​ — a house or an apartment fully furnished and well - equipped, a nice car, and the latest electronic devices.
However, Christians who live as temporary residents do not let their desires go beyond what is reasonable and possible for them.
Indeed, it is commendable that many forgo certain material comforts in order to devote more time and energy to Jehovah’s service as zealous Kingdom publishers.
Others serve as pioneers, at Bethel, in the traveling work, or as missionaries.
How much all of us appreciate the wholehearted service of our fellow worshippers of Jehovah!
What lesson can we draw from Jesus ’ parable of the sower?
In his parable of the sower, Jesus said that “the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches ” can choke the word of God in our hearts and cause us to become unfruitful.
Our living contentedly as temporary residents in this system of things helps us to avoid falling into this trap.
Instead, it enables us to keep our eye “simple, ” or“ in focus, ” looking “all one way ” toward God’s Kingdom and keeping its interests first in our lives. ​ — Matt. 6: 22, ftn.
“The World Is Passing Away ”
What words of the apostle John determine the outlook and conduct of true Christians toward the present world?
A fundamental reason why we as true Christians consider ourselves to be “aliens and temporary residents ” in this world is our conviction that its days are numbered.
This outlook determines our choices in life, our desires, and our aspirations.
The apostle John counseled fellow believers not to love the world or the things in the world because “the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever. ” ​ — 1 John 2: 15 - 17.
How can we show that we have been set apart as a distinct people?
The Israelites were told that if they obeyed Jehovah, they would become his “special property out of all other peoples. ”
When faithful, Israel differed from all other nations in worship and way of life.
Similarly today, Jehovah has separated for himself a people who are markedly different from Satan’s world.
We are told: “Repudiate ungodliness and worldly desires and... live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things, while we wait for the happy hope and glorious manifestation of the great God and of the Savior of us, Christ Jesus, who gave himself for us that he might deliver us from every sort of lawlessness and cleanse for himself a people peculiarly his own, zealous for fine works. ”
This “people ” is made up of anointed Christians and millions of Jesus ’“ other sheep, ” who aid and support them. ​ — John 10: 16.
Why will the anointed and their companions never regret having lived as temporary residents in this wicked world?
“The happy hope ” of the anointed is that of reigning with Christ in heaven.
When the hope of eternal life on earth is fulfilled for the other sheep, they will no longer be temporary residents in a wicked world.
They will have beautiful homes and an abundance to eat and drink.
Unlike the Israelites, they will never forget that all of this is from Jehovah, “the God of the whole earth. ”
Neither the anointed nor the other sheep will regret having lived as temporary residents in this wicked world.

Help Men to Progress Spiritually
“From now on you will be catching [people] alive. ” ​ — LUKE 5: 10.
1, 2. (a) How did men respond to Jesus ’ preaching?
(b) What will be considered in this article?
DURING a preaching tour throughout Galilee, Jesus and his disciples boarded a boat to withdraw into a lonely place.
But crowds followed them on foot.
Those who came that day numbered “about five thousand men, besides women and young children. ”
On another occasion, a crowd approached Jesus, desiring to be healed and to hear him speak.
Included were “four thousand men, besides women and young children. ”
Evidently, many men were among the people who came to Jesus and showed interest in his teaching.
In fact, he expected many others to respond, for after providing a miraculous catch of fish, Jesus told his disciple Simon: “From now on you will be catching men [or, people] alive. ”
His disciples were to lower their nets into the sea of mankind and could expect that their ‘ catch ’ would include many men.
Today, men likewise show interest in the Scriptural message we preach and respond to it.
However, many men hold back and fail to progress spiritually.
How can we help them?
Although Jesus did not develop a special ministry to seek out men, he certainly addressed issues that concerned the men of his day.
Using his example, let us examine how we can help men deal with three common concerns today: (1) making a living, (2) fear of popular opinion, and (3) feelings of inadequacy.
Making a Living
3, 4. (a) What is a major concern for many men?
(b) Why do some men put earning a living ahead of spiritual pursuits?
“Teacher, ” said a scribe to Jesus,“ I will follow you wherever you are about to go. ”
However, when Jesus told him that “the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head, ” the scribe had second thoughts.
The uncertainty of where his next meal would come from or where he would live apparently did not sit well with the scribe, for there is no indication that he became a follower of Christ. ​ — Matt.
8: 19, 20. Men often put material security ahead of spiritual pursuits.
Getting higher education and securing a well - paying job are priorities for many of them.
According to their way of thinking, the reward of making money is more urgent and practical than any benefits that might come from studying the Scriptures and seeking a close relationship with God.
What the Bible teaches may appeal to them, but “the anxieties of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches ” choke whatever interest they may have.
Consider how Jesus helped his disciples to adjust their priorities.
5, 6.
What helped Andrew, Peter, James, and John to adjust their priorities regarding sharing in the preaching work and making a living?
Andrew and his brother Simon Peter were partners in a fishing business. So were John, his brother James, and their father, Zebedee.
Business was good enough to require the help of hired men.
When Andrew and John first learned about Jesus from John the Baptizer, they were convinced that they had found the Messiah.
Andrew shared the news with his brother Simon Peter, and perhaps John did so with his brother James.
In the following months, all four spent time with Jesus as he preached in Galilee, Judea, and Samaria. Then the four disciples returned to the fishing business.
They had an interest in spiritual matters, but the ministry was not their number one concern.
Some time later, Jesus invited Peter and Andrew to come after him and become “fishers of men. ”
How did the two respond?
“At once abandoning the nets, they followed him. ”
It was the same with James and John. “At once leaving the boat and their father, they followed him. ”
What helped these men take up the full - time ministry?
Was it an emotional, spur - of - the - moment decision?
Over the previous months, these men listened to Jesus, saw him perform miracles, observed his zeal for righteousness, and witnessed the amazing response to his preaching.
As a result, their faith in Jehovah and their trust in him became stronger!
How can we help Bible students to build trust in Jehovah’s ability to provide for his people?
How can we imitate Jesus in helping our Bible students to build their trust in Jehovah?
The way we teach has a considerable bearing on this.
When teaching, we can highlight God’s promise to bless us abundantly if we put Kingdom interests first.
(Read Malachi 3: 10; Matthew 6: 33.)
Although we can use various scriptures to emphasize how Jehovah provides for his people, not to be overlooked is the effect of the example we ourselves set.
Sharing experiences from our own life can accomplish much in helping our students develop reliance on Jehovah.
We can also share encouraging experiences that we read about in our literature.
(a) Why is it important for a Bible student to “taste and see that Jehovah is good ”?
(b) How can we assist our student to experience Jehovah’s goodness personally?
Developing strong faith requires more than reading and hearing about how others have experienced Jehovah’s blessing.
A Bible student also needs to experience Jehovah’s goodness personally.
The psalmist sang: “Taste and see that Jehovah is good, O you people; happy is the able - bodied man that takes refuge in him. ”
How can we assist the student to see that Jehovah is good?
Suppose a student who has financial worries is also trying to overcome a bad habit, such as smoking, gambling, or heavy drinking.
Would not teaching the student to pray for God’s assistance in overcoming a bad habit help him to experience Jehovah’s goodness?
Consider also what can happen when we encourage the student to give priority to spiritual things by making time for weekly Bible study and preparing for and attending Christian meetings.
Why, as he personally experiences Jehovah’s blessing on his efforts, his faith will grow stronger!
Fear of Popular Opinion
9, 10. (a) Why did Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea keep their interest in Jesus secret?
(b) Why do some men today hesitate to follow Christ?
Because of peer pressure, some men may hesitate to follow Christ fully.
Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea kept their interest in Jesus secret because they were afraid of what other Jews might say or do if they found out.
This fear was not imaginary.
The religious leaders ’ hatred for Jesus eventually became so great that anyone who confessed faith in him was expelled from the synagogue. ​ — John 9: 22.
In some places today, if a man takes too much interest in God, the Bible, or religion, he may be harassed by his workmates, friends, or relatives.
In other places, it may even be dangerous to talk about changing one’s religion.
Peer pressure can be especially difficult when a man is actively serving in the military, in politics, or in the local community.
For example, a man in Germany admitted: “What you Witnesses preach about the Bible is true.
But if I became a Witness today, by tomorrow everyone would know about it.
What would they think at work, in the neighborhood, and at the club my family and I belong to?
I could not put up with that. ”
How did Jesus help his disciples to cope with fear of man?
Although none of Jesus ’ apostles were cowards, they all struggled with fear of man.
How did Jesus help them to progress despite intense pressure from their peers?
Jesus took steps to prepare his disciples for the opposition they would later face. “Happy are you whenever men hate you, ” he said,“ and whenever they exclude you and reproach you and cast out your name as wicked for the sake of the Son of man. ” Jesus warned his followers that they should expect reproach. Any reproach was “for the sake of the Son of man. ”
Jesus also assured them that God would back them up as long as they relied on Him for help and strength.
Moreover, Jesus invited new ones to associate freely with his disciples and make friends with them. ​ — Mark 10: 29, 30.
In what ways can we help new ones to overcome fear of man?
We too need to assist Bible students to overcome fear of man.
A challenge is often easier to face when it is anticipated.
For instance, why not help the student to prepare simple, reasonable, Bible - based replies to the questions and objections his fellow employees and others may bring up?
In addition to our being his personal friend, we can introduce him to other members of the congregation, especially those with whom he might have something in common.
Above all, we should teach him to pray regularly and from the heart.
This can help him to draw close to God and make Jehovah his Refuge and Rock. ​ — Read Psalm 94: 21 - 23; James 4: 8.
Feelings of Inadequacy
How can feelings of inadequacy hold some back from getting involved in spiritual matters?
Certain men hold back from getting involved in spiritual matters because they do not read well or cannot express themselves fluently or are just shy.
Some men are uncomfortable sharing their views or feelings in a public setting.
The thought of having to study, comment at Christian meetings, or share their faith with others may seem overwhelming to them.
“When I was young, ” admits a Christian brother,“ I would quickly walk up to the door, pretend to ring the doorbell, and quietly walk away, hoping no one would hear or see me....
The thought of going from door to door made me physically ill. ”
Why could Jesus ’ disciples not heal a demon - possessed boy?
Think of the lack of confidence Jesus ’ disciples must have experienced when they could not heal a demon - possessed boy.
The son’s father came to Jesus and said: “[My son] is an epileptic and is ill, for he falls often into the fire and often into the water; and I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him. ”
Jesus expelled the demon, thus curing the boy.
The disciples later approached Jesus and asked: “Why is it we could not expel it? ”
Jesus answered: “Because of your little faith.
For truly I say to you, If you have faith the size of a mustard grain, you will say to this mountain, ‘ Transfer from here to there, ’ and it will transfer, and nothing will be impossible for you. ”
Faith in Jehovah is needed in order to overcome mountainlike obstacles.
What happens if a person loses sight of this and begins to focus on his own abilities?
Failure to succeed will result in a lack of confidence.
15, 16.
How may we be able to help a Bible student to overcome feelings of inadequacy?
A fine way to help someone struggling with feelings of inadequacy is to encourage him to focus on Jehovah instead of on himself.
Peter wrote: “Humble yourselves... under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time; while you throw all your anxiety upon him. ”
This requires that we help our Bible student to develop spirituality.
A spiritually inclined person keenly values spiritual things.
He loves God’s Word and manifests “the fruitage of the spirit ” in his life.
He is a man of prayer.
Moreover, he looks to God for the courage and strength needed to face any situation or to fulfill any assignment successfully. ​ — Read 2 Timothy 1: 7, 8.
Some students may also need practical assistance with their reading, conversation, or speaking abilities.
Others may feel unworthy of serving God because of the bad acts they committed before coming to know Jehovah.
In either case, our loving, patient assistance may be just what they need.
“Persons in health do not need a physician, ” said Jesus,“ but the ailing do. ” ​ — Matt.
9: 12. ‘ Catch ’ More Men
17, 18. (a) How might we reach out to more men in our ministry?
(b) What will we study next?
It is our desire that many more men will respond to the deeply satisfying message that is found only in the Bible.
So how can we reach out to more men in our ministry?
By spending more time witnessing in the evenings, on weekend afternoons, or during holidays when more men are at home.
We can ask to speak with the man of the house when possible.
Let us witness informally to male workmates when appropriate and reach out to unbelieving husbands in the congregation.
As we preach to everyone we meet, we can be confident that those with appreciative hearts will respond favorably.
Let us patiently help all who show a sincere interest in the truth.
How, though, can we help baptized men in the congregation to reach out and qualify for responsibility in God’s organization?
The next article will address this question.
See Yearbooks of Jehovah’s Witnesses as well as life stories published in The Watchtower and Awake!

Train Others to Reach Out
“Everyone that is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher. ” ​ — LUKE 6: 40.
During his earthly ministry, how did Jesus lay the foundation for a remarkable congregation?
CONCLUDING his Gospel account, the apostle John wrote: “There are, in fact, many other things also which Jesus did, which, if ever they were written in full detail, I suppose, the world itself could not contain the scrolls written. ”
Among all the things that Jesus accomplished during his short but dynamic ministry was the locating, training, and organizing of men who would take the lead after his earthly sojourn.
When he returned to heaven in 33 C.E., Jesus left behind the foundation of a remarkable congregation that would quickly number into the thousands. ​ — Acts 2: 41, 42; 4: 4; 6: 7.
2, 3. (a) Why is there a pressing need for baptized men to reach out?
(b) What will be considered in this article?
With more than seven million active Kingdom proclaimers in over 100,000 congregations worldwide today, there continues to be a need for men to take the lead in spiritual matters.
For instance, Christian elders are greatly needed.
Those who reach out for this privilege of service are to be commended, for they are “desirous of a fine work. ” ​ — 1 Tim. 3: 1.
However, men do not automatically qualify for privileges in the congregation.
Mere secular education or life experience does not prepare a man for this kind of work. To serve properly in such a capacity, a man must qualify spiritually.
More than abilities or accomplishments, he must have spiritual qualities.
How can men in the congregation be helped to qualify?
“Everyone that is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher, ” said Jesus.
In this article, we will consider some of the ways in which the Master Teacher, Jesus Christ, helped his disciples to qualify for greater responsibility, and we will see what lessons we can draw from what he did.
“I Have Called You Friends ”
How did Jesus show himself to be a real friend to his disciples?
Jesus treated his disciples as friends, not as inferiors.
He spent time with them, took them into his confidence, and ‘ made known to them all the things he had heard from his Father. ’
(Read John 15: 15.)
Imagine how thrilled they were when Jesus answered their question: “What will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things? ”
He also shared with his followers his private thoughts and feelings.
On the night of his betrayal, for instance, Jesus took Peter, James, and John into the garden of Gethsemane, where he prayed earnestly from his troubled heart.
The three apostles may not have heard what Jesus was saying in prayer, but they must have sensed the gravity of the occasion.
Think, too, of the impact that the transfiguration must have had earlier on the three.
The intimate friendship that Jesus forged with his disciples was an anchor for them as they later cared for weighty assignments.
What are some ways in which Christian elders can make themselves available to others?
Like Jesus, Christian elders today befriend and help others.
They cultivate a warm, close relationship with their fellow believers by taking time to show personal interest in them.
While elders recognize the importance of confidentiality, they are not secretive.
Elders trust their brothers and share with them Scriptural truths they themselves have learned.
By no means do elders treat as inferior a ministerial servant who may be comparatively young.
Instead, they think of him as a spiritual man with potential who is performing a valuable service in behalf of the congregation.
“I Set the Pattern for You ”
6, 7.
Describe the example Jesus set for his disciples and the effect this had on them.
Although Jesus ’ disciples had appreciation for spiritual things, their thinking was sometimes influenced by their background and culture.
However, Jesus did not lecture or threaten his disciples.
He neither burdened them with unreasonable demands nor advised them to do one thing while he himself did something else.
Rather, Jesus taught them by example. ​ — Read John 13: 15.
What kind of model did Jesus leave for his disciples?
He kept his life simple so that he could freely minister to others.
Jesus was modest and always based his teaching on the Scriptures.
He was approachable and kind.
Love was the motivation for everything he did.
Jesus ’ example had a positive influence on his apostles.
For instance, James did not cower in the face of death but until he was executed, loyally served God.
John faithfully followed in Jesus ’ footsteps for more than 60 years. ​ — Rev. 1: 1, 2, 9.
What example do elders set for younger men and others?
Elders who are self - sacrificing, humble, and loving provide the kind of example that younger men need.
Moreover, elders who are exemplary in faith, in teaching, in Christian living, and in the ministry experience the satisfaction of knowing that others can imitate their faith. ​ — Heb. 13: 7.
‘ Giving Them Orders, Jesus Sent Them Forth ’
How do we know that Jesus trained his disciples to carry out the evangelizing work?
After zealously engaging in his ministry for about two years, Jesus expanded the preaching activity by sending out his 12 apostles to preach.
First, though, he gave them instructions.
When about to feed a crowd of thousands miraculously, Jesus told his disciples how he wanted them to organize the people and distribute the food.
Clearly, then, Jesus trained his disciples by giving them clear and specific direction.
This pattern of training, coupled with the powerful influence of holy spirit, later equipped the apostles to organize the extensive preaching work that took place in 33 C.E. and thereafter.
10, 11.
In what ways can progressive training be provided for new ones?
Today, spiritual instruction begins when a man accepts a Bible study.
We may need to help him to read well.
Our assistance continues as we conduct Bible studies with him.
When he starts to attend Christian meetings regularly, his spiritual training will progress as he participates in the Theocratic Ministry School, becomes an unbaptized publisher, and so forth.
After baptism, his training can include such things as helping with Kingdom Hall maintenance.
In time, a brother can be helped to see what he needs to do to qualify as a ministerial servant.
When giving a baptized brother an assignment, an elder gladly explains the relevant organizational procedures and provides needed instruction.
The brother being trained must understand what is expected of him.
If he is struggling with what he is asked to do, a loving elder does not quickly conclude that he is not qualified.
Rather, the elder kindly points out the specific areas of concern and reviews the goals and procedures.
Seeing men respond positively to such efforts and thus experience the joy that comes from serving others is a source of happiness to the elders. ​ — Acts 20: 35.
“The One Listening to Counsel Is Wise ”
What made Jesus ’ counsel effective?
Jesus trained his disciples by providing personal counsel tailored to their needs.
For example, he rebuked James and John for wanting to call down fire from heaven on some Samaritans who had not received him.
When the mother of James and John approached Jesus on their behalf to ask that they be granted favored positions in the Kingdom, Jesus addressed the brothers directly, saying: “This sitting down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father. ”
At all times, Jesus gave counsel that was clear, practical, and solidly based on godly principles. He taught his disciples to reason on such principles.
Jesus also recognized the limitations of his followers and did not expect perfection from them.
His counsel was motivated by genuine love. ​ — John 13: 1.
13, 14. (a) Who needs counsel?
(b) Give examples of what personal counsel an elder may offer to someone who is not progressing spiritually.
Every man who reaches out for responsibility in the Christian congregation needs counsel or Scriptural advice at one time or another.
“The one listening to counsel is wise, ” states Proverbs 12: 15.
“I found that my biggest challenge was dealing with my own imperfections, ” says one young brother.
“The advice of an elder put this into proper perspective for me. ”
If elders observe that some questionable conduct is retarding a man’s spiritual progress, they take the initiative to readjust him in a spirit of mildness.
At times, counsel is needed because of some personality trait.
If a brother seems somewhat self - sparing, for example, an elder may find it helpful to point out that Jesus was a zealous Kingdom proclaimer who commissioned his followers to make disciples.
If a brother appears ambitious, an elder might show him how Jesus helped His disciples to see the dangers of seeking prominence.
What if a brother has a tendency to be unforgiving?
The illustration of the slave who refused to forgive a small debt even though he himself had been forgiven much more would make a powerful point.
When counsel is needed, it is good for the elders to provide it at the earliest opportunity. ​ — Read Proverbs 27: 9.
How can a man’s family help him to serve others?
The elders take the lead in training men to reach out, but others can support their efforts.
For instance, a man’s family can and should help him to reach out.
And if he already is an elder, he will benefit from the support of a loving wife and unselfish children.
Their willingness to share him with the congregation is essential if he is to succeed in shouldering his responsibility.
Their self - sacrificing spirit brings him joy and is greatly appreciated by others. ​ — Prov.
15: 20; 31: 10, 23.
(a) The primary responsibility to reach out rests with whom?
(b) How can a man reach out for privileges in the congregation?
Although others can help and support him, the primary responsibility for reaching out rests with the man himself. (Read Galatians 6: 5.)
Of course, a brother does not have to be a ministerial servant or an elder in order to help others and have a full share in the ministry.
However, reaching out for privileges in the congregation does mean striving to meet the qualifications set out in the Scriptures.
So if a man desires to serve as a ministerial servant or an elder but has not yet been appointed to be one, he should give attention to areas where he needs to make spiritual advancement.
This calls for regular Bible reading, diligent personal study, serious meditation, heartfelt prayer, and zealous participation in the Christian ministry.
In such ways, he can personally apply Paul’s counsel to Timothy: “Be training yourself with godly devotion as your aim. ” ​ — 1 Tim. 4: 7.
17, 18.
What can a baptized brother do if anxiety, feelings of inadequacy, or a lack of motivation holds him back?
But what if a man is not reaching out because of anxiety or feelings of inadequacy? He would do well to consider how much Jehovah God and Jesus Christ do for us.
Indeed, Jehovah “daily carries the load for us. ”
So our heavenly Father can help a brother to take on responsibility in the congregation.
A brother who is not serving as a ministerial servant or an elder will also find it beneficial to consider the fact that there is a great need for mature men to accept privileges of service in God’s organization.
Reflecting on such points may move a brother to put forth effort to overcome negative feelings.
He can pray for holy spirit, bearing in mind that its fruitage includes peace and self - control ​ — qualities needed to dispel anxiety or feelings of inadequacy.
And one can be fully confident that Jehovah blesses all who reach out with a proper motive.
Could it be that a lack of motivation is preventing a baptized man from reaching out?
What can help a brother who lacks the desire to serve?
The apostle Paul wrote: “[God], for the sake of his good pleasure, is acting within you in order for you both to will and to act. ”
The desire to serve is God - given, and Jehovah’s spirit can strengthen a person to render sacred service.
Moreover, a Christian can pray that God will make him do what is right. ​ — Ps.
25: 4, 5.
Of what does the raising up of “seven shepherds, yes, eight dukes ” assure us?
Jehovah blesses the efforts of older men to train others.
His blessing is also experienced by those who respond and reach out for privileges in the congregation.
The Scriptures assure us that among God’s people “seven shepherds, yes, eight dukes ” ​ — the required number of capable men — ​ will be raised up to take the lead in Jehovah’s organization.
What a blessing it is that so many Christian men are being trained and are humbly reaching out for privileges of service to Jehovah’s praise!

Questions From Readers
Is it possible to determine the exact time of day that the impalement of Jesus Christ took place?
This question arises because of a seeming discrepancy between the inspired accounts of Jesus ’ death recorded by the Gospel writer Mark and by the apostle John.
Mark states: “It was now the third hour, and they [soldiers] impaled him. ”
According to John, “it was about the sixth hour ” when Pilate handed Jesus over to the Jews to be impaled.
However, sufficient Scriptural information is not available to explain the difference between the two accounts.
Still, considering how people viewed time back in those days can be helpful.
In the first century of our Common Era, the Jews divided the daylight into 12 hours, counting from sunrise.
Of course, the sun rose and set at different times during the year. Consequently, the length of the daylight period varied, according to the season.
Moreover, the hour of the day was determined by observing the position of the sun. Hence, references to time were approximate.
The Christian Greek Scriptures generally refer to events occurring at the third, sixth, or ninth hour ​ — often meaning about that time.
More specific reference, such as “the seventh hour, ” was made only when the timing was essential to the development of the account being related. ​ — John 4: 52.
The Gospel accounts harmonize with regard to the timing of events during Jesus ’ last day on earth. All four indicate that the priests and older men met after dawn and then had Jesus taken to the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate.
Matthew, Mark, and Luke all report that from the sixth hour, when Jesus was already on the stake, darkness fell over the land “until the ninth hour. ” ​ — Matt. 27: 45, 46; Mark 15: 33, 34; Luke 23: 44.
One significant factor that may have a bearing on the timing of Jesus ’ impalement is this: Scourging or whipping was considered a part of the impalement process.
Sometimes the scourging was so terrible that the victim died under it.
If the scourging was viewed as the start of the impalement procedure, some time would have to elapse before the nailing of Jesus to the torture stake took place.
Different individuals might therefore give different times for the impalement, depending on the stage of the overall process during which they personally took note of the time.
The apostle John wrote his account decades after the other Gospel writers.
He therefore had access to their accounts. True, John included a time that appears to vary from that given by Mark.
However, this provides clear evidence that John did not simply copy Mark’s account.
Both John and Mark were inspired by God.
Although sufficient Scriptural information is not available to explain the difference, we can trust the Gospel accounts.
Do You Find Joy in “the Privilege of Kindly Giving ”?
EARLY Christians in Philippi were known for their generous support of true worship.
In his inspired letter to them, the apostle Paul wrote: “I thank my God always upon every remembrance of you in every supplication of mine for all of you, as I offer my supplication with joy, because of the contribution you have made to the good news from the first day until this moment. ”
Paul well remembered when Lydia and her household were baptized and she hospitably insisted that he and his preaching companions stay in her house. ​ — Acts 16: 14, 15.
Not long thereafter, the newly formed congregation in Philippi twice sent provisions to Paul during his stay of several weeks with fellow believers in Thessalonica, nearly 100 miles (160 km) away.
A few years later, while the Philippians and other Macedonian brothers were experiencing affliction and “deep poverty, ” they heard about the need of persecuted Christians in Jerusalem and wanted to help them.
Paul testified that this was really “beyond their actual ability. ”
Yet, he wrote: “They... kept begging us with much entreaty for the privilege of kindly giving. ” ​ — 2 Cor. 8: 1 - 4; Rom. 15: 26.
Some ten years after the Philippians first embraced Christianity, they were still displaying the same generous spirit.
Having heard that Paul was imprisoned in Rome, they sent Epaphroditus 800 miles (1,287 km) over land and sea carrying supplies to the apostle.
Clearly, the Philippians wanted to provide for Paul so that he could keep on strengthening the brothers and preaching, even while he was imprisoned. ​ — Phil.
1: 12 - 14; 2: 25 - 30; 4: 18. Today, true Christians consider it a privilege to support the Kingdom - preaching and disciple - making work.
They promote Kingdom interests by contributing time, effort, and funds.

A trust benefiting a religious organization may provide certain tax advantages.
As the term “charitable planning ” implies, these types of donations typically require some planning on the part of the donor.
To assist individuals desiring to benefit the worldwide work of Jehovah’s Witnesses through some form of charitable planning, a brochure has been prepared in English and Spanish entitled Charitable Planning to Benefit Kingdom Service Worldwide.
The brochure was written to provide information on a variety of ways that gifts may be made either now or through a bequest at death.
After reading the brochure and conferring with their own legal or tax advisers, many have been able to help support our religious and humanitarian activities worldwide and maximize their tax benefits while doing so.
This brochure may be obtained by requesting a copy directly from the Charitable Planning Office.

Jehu Champions Pure Worship
JEHU was a champion of pure worship.
In carrying out this role, he was energetic, prompt, relentless, zealous, and courageous.
Jehu manifested qualities that we would do well to imitate.
Jehu received a commission when the nation of Israel was in a bad state.
The country was under the wicked influence of Jezebel, widow of Ahab and mother of the ruling king, Jehoram.
She promoted the Baal cult at the expense of Jehovah’s worship, killed God’s prophets, and corrupted the people with her “fornications ” and“ sorceries. ”
Jehovah decreed the elimination of the whole house of Ahab, including Jehoram and Jezebel.
Jehu was to spearhead that action.
The Scriptures introduce Jehu as he sat with military chiefs when the Israelites were fighting the Syrians at Ramoth - gilead.
Jehu was a high - ranking officer, if not the commander of Israel’s army.
The prophet Elisha sent one of the sons of the prophets to anoint Jehu as king and to instruct him to kill every male of the apostate house of Ahab. ​ — 2 Ki.
8: 28; 9: 1 - 10.
When Jehu’s fellow officers asked about the purpose of this visit, Jehu was reluctant to say.
But when pressed, he told them the truth, and he and his companions began to conspire against Jehoram.
Likely, there had been underlying resentment and resistance to the policies of the ruling house and to Jezebel’s influence.
In any case, Jehu made a studied effort to find the best way to carry out his commission.
King Jehoram had been wounded in battle and had withdrawn to the city of Jezreel, hoping to recuperate.
Jehu knew that if his plan was going to succeed, no word of it must reach Jezreel. “Do not let anyone go out in escape from the city to go and make report in Jezreel, ” said Jehu. Perhaps he anticipated at least some resistance from troops loyal to Jehoram.
Jehu wanted to rule out the possibility of such resistance.
A FURIOUS DRIVE!
To use the element of surprise, Jehu drove in his chariot from Ramoth - gilead to Jezreel, a distance of 45 miles (72 km).
As he sped toward his destination, a watchman on a tower saw “the heaving mass of Jehu’s men. ”
Very likely, Jehu took a considerable force with him in order to be sure of accomplishing his purpose.
Perceiving that courageous Jehu was in one of the chariots, the watchman exclaimed: “It is with madness that he drives. ”
If Jehu normally drove in a similar way, his haste on this particular mission must have made it a furious drive indeed.
After refusing to say anything to two messengers sent to him, Jehu met King Jehoram and his ally Ahaziah, the king of Judah, each in his own chariot.
Jehoram’s question, “Is there peace, Jehu? ”
was met by the retort: “What peace could there be as long as there are the fornications of Jezebel your mother and her many sorceries? ”
Alarmed by this response, Jehoram turned to flee. But Jehu was too fast for him!
Drawing a bow, he shot an arrow through Jehoram’s heart, and the king fell dead in his chariot.
Although Ahaziah managed to escape, Jehu later tracked him down and had him killed too. ​ — 2 Ki.
9: 22 - 24, 27.
The next member of Ahab’s house to be eliminated was wicked Queen Jezebel. Jehu rightly referred to her as “this accursed one. ”
As Jehu drove into Jezreel, he saw her looking down from a palace window. Without wasting words, Jehu commanded the court officials to throw Jezebel down from the window.
Jehu then had his horses trample this corrupter of all Israel.
Thereafter, Jehu proceeded to eliminate dozens of other members of the house of wicked Ahab. ​ — 2 Ki.
9: 30 - 34; 10: 1 - 14.
Though the thought of violence is unpleasant, we should realize that in those days, Jehovah used his servants to carry out his judgments.
The Scriptures state: “It was from God that the downfall of Ahaziah occurred by his coming to Jehoram; and when he came, he went out with Jehoram to Jehu the grandson of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. ”
As he threw Jehoram’s body from his chariot, Jehu recognized that this act fulfilled Jehovah’s promise to exact punishment for Ahab’s murder of Naboth.
Moreover, Jehu had been commanded to “avenge the blood of [God’s] servants ” shed by Jezebel. ​ — 2 Ki.
9: 7, 25, 26; 1 Ki.
21: 17 - 19.
Today, no servant of Jehovah uses physical force against opponents of pure worship.
“Vengeance is mine, ” God says.
But to rid the congregation of potentially corrupting influences, Christian elders may have to act with courage similar to that of Jehu.
And all members of the congregation need to be determined to avoid the company of disfellowshipped individuals. ​ — 2 John 9 - 11.
JEHU TOLERATED NO RIVALRY TOWARD JEHOVAH
Jehu’s motive for carrying out his commission is evident from his subsequent words to faithful Jehonadab: “Do go along with me and look upon my toleration of no rivalry toward Jehovah. ”
Jehonadab accepted that invitation, got into Jehu’s chariot, and rode with him to Samaria.
There, Jehu “acted slyly, for the purpose of destroying the worshipers of Baal. ” ​ — 2 Ki.
10: 15 - 17, 19.
Jehu announced that he intended to hold “a great sacrifice ” for Baal.
“This is a clever play on words on the part of Jehu, ” says one scholar.
While the term employed here “generally means ‘ sacrifice, ’ it is also used of the ‘ slaughter ’ of apostates. ”
Because Jehu did not want any Baal worshippers to miss this event, he assembled all of them in the house of Baal and had them dress in distinctive attire.
“As soon as he finished rendering up the burnt offering, ” Jehu had 80 armed men slaughter Baal’s devotees.
He then had the house of Baal demolished and its site set aside for privies, making it unfit for worship. ​ — 2 Ki.
10: 20 - 27.
It is true that Jehu spilled much blood. Yet, the Scriptures present him as a courageous man who freed Israel from the oppressive domination of Jezebel and her family.
If any leader of Israel was to succeed in doing this, he had to be a man of courage, determination, and zeal.
“It was rough work and was executed with relentless thoroughness, ” comments one Bible dictionary.
“Gentler measures probably would have failed to eradicate Baal worship from Israel. ”
No doubt you can see that circumstances faced by Christians today require that they manifest certain qualities possessed by Jehu.
For instance, how should we react if tempted to engage in any activity that Jehovah condemns?
We should be prompt, courageous, and dynamic in rejecting it.
When it comes to our godly devotion, we cannot tolerate any rivalry toward Jehovah.
TAKE CARE TO WALK IN JEHOVAH’S LAW
The end of this story provides a warning.
Jehu ‘ did not turn aside from following the golden calves in Bethel and Dan. ’
How is tolerance of idolatry possible in the case of one who seemed so zealous for pure worship?
Jehu may have believed that the independence of the kingdom of Israel from Judah required the religious separation of the two kingdoms.
Hence, like former kings of Israel, he attempted to keep them separate by perpetuating calf worship.
Jehovah commended Jehu because ‘ he acted well in doing what was right in God’s eyes. ’
Nevertheless, Jehu “did not take care to walk in the law of Jehovah the God of Israel with all his heart. ”
Considering everything else that Jehu did earlier, you might find this surprising and sad.
Yet, it does provide a lesson for us.
We can never take our relationship with Jehovah for granted.
Every day, we need to cultivate loyalty to God through study of his Word, meditation on it, and heartfelt prayer to our heavenly Father.
Let us, therefore, exercise utmost care to keep on walking in Jehovah’s law with all our heart. ​ — 1 Cor.
10: 12. [Box on page 4]
Jehu in Secular History
Critics have often questioned whether characters mentioned in the Scriptures actually existed.
So is there any extra - Biblical evidence regarding Jehu?
At least three documents from ancient Assyria mention this king of Israel by name.
One of these purports to show Jehu, or perhaps one of his emissaries, bowing before Assyrian King Shalmaneser III and offering tribute.
The accompanying inscription reads: “The tribute of Jehu (Ia - ú - a), son of Omri (Hu - um - ri); I received from him silver, gold, a golden saplu - bowl, a golden vase with pointed bottom, golden tumblers, golden buckets, tin, a staff for a king, (and) wooden puruhtu [the meaning of the latter word being unknown]. ”
Jehu was not a direct “son of Omri, ” but this expression was used to designate successive kings of Israel, likely because of Omri’s fame and his building of Israel’s capital, Samaria.
The Assyrian king’s claim regarding the tribute Jehu supposedly paid cannot be corroborated.
Even so, he mentions Jehu three times ​ — on a stela, on a statue of Shalmaneser, and in the Assyrian royal annals.
These references leave little doubt as to the historical reality of this Bible character.
“Disabled Now but Not Forever! ”
As told by Sara van der Monde
People often tell me, “Sara, you have such a lovely smile.
Why are you always so happy? ”
I tell them that I have a special hope.
It is summed up in these words, “I am disabled now but not forever! ”
I WAS born in 1974 in Paris, France.
My birth was difficult, and later I was diagnosed with cerebral palsy.
I had limited limb movement, and my speech was hard to understand.
I also developed epilepsy and was prone to infections.
When I was two years old, my family moved to Melbourne, Australia.
Two years later, Dad walked out on Mum and me.
That was the first time that I recall feeling close to God.
Mum, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, regularly took me to Christian meetings, where I learned that God loved me and cared for me.
That knowledge, along with Mum’s love and reassurance, helped me to feel safe despite our changed circumstances.
Actually, I have found praying to be a lot easier than talking.
During prayer, I do not have to struggle to verbalize the words, but I “hear ” them clearly formed in my mind.
And because my speech is difficult to understand, it is reassuring to know that Jehovah understands everything, whether I say it silently in my mind or with stumbling speech. ​ — Ps.
65: 2.
By the time I was five, my palsy had advanced to the point that I needed heavy caliper splints to walk.
I really wobbled more than I walked! By age 11, I could not even walk.
Later, I could not get in and out of bed without the aid of an electric hoist to lift me into my motorized wheelchair, which I maneuver using a hand lever.
I admit that at times my disabilities get me down.
But then I remember our family motto: “Don’t worry about the things you can’t do.
Just get on with the things you can do. ”
This has helped me to succeed at horseback riding, sailing, canoeing, camping, and even driving a car around a track!
I express my artistic nature through painting, sewing, quilting, embroidering, and making ceramics.
Because of my severe disabilities, some have questioned my ability to worship God as an intelligent adult. When I was 18, a schoolteacher urged me to leave home to “escape ” my mother’s religion.
She even offered to help me find accommodations.
However, I told her that I would never leave my faith and would leave home only when I was ready to be more independent.
Not long after the episode with my teacher, I was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Two years later, I moved into a small apartment. Here I enjoy a happy balance of support and independence.
An Unexpected Proposal
Over the years, I have faced other tests of faith.
One day I was completely floored when a fellow student ​ — also disabled — ​ asked me to marry him. At first, I was flattered.
Like most young women, I yearn to have a partner in life. Yet, having a disability in common is no guarantee of a happy marriage.
Moreover, the young man did not share my faith.
Our beliefs, activities, and goals were completely different.
So how could we make a life together?
I was also determined to obey God’s clear direction to marry only a fellow believer.
Therefore, I kindly told the young man that I could not accept his offer.
Even today, I know I made the right choice.
And there is no doubt in my mind that I will be happy in God’s promised new world.
Meanwhile, I am determined to remain loyal to Jehovah and to be content with my current circumstances.
I yearn for the day when I can leap from my wheelchair and run like the wind.
Then I will cry out, “I was disabled, but now I am sound in health ​ — forever! ”

23 “A Time to Love and a Time to Hate ” 27 I Wanted to Be Like Jephthah’s Daughter
“I think [it] is tembatsu (divine punishment), although I feel sorry for disaster victims, ” said a leading Japanese politician after that country was hit by a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake and a tsunami in March 2011.
When more than 220,000 people were killed in the earthquake that hit Haiti in January 2010, a prominent televangelist claimed that it was because they “swore a pact to the devil ” and needed to have a“ turning to god. ”
“God wants to awaken our deaden [ed] and indifferent conscience, ” declared a Catholic priest when 79 people died in a stampede in Manila, Philippines.
A newspaper there reported that “twenty - one percent of adults believe God is unleashing his wrath with landslides, typhoons and other disasters ” that frequently pummel the country.
THE belief that God brings about disasters to punish bad people is not new.
In 1755, after some 60,000 people perished in an earthquake, a fire, and a tsunami that hit Lisbon, Portugal, well - known philosopher Voltaire queried: “Was then more vice in fallen Lisbon found, than Paris, where voluptuous joys abound? ”
Indeed, millions have wondered if God is using natural disasters to punish people.
In many countries such disasters are in fact called acts of God.
In view of all of this, we need to ask: Has God really been using natural disasters to punish people?
Is the recent barrage of disastrous events punishment from God?
In their rush to blame God, some point to Bible accounts where God brought destruction by natural elements.
An examination of these Bible accounts shows, however, that in each case, there are three major distinguishing factors.
First, there was warning beforehand.
Second, unlike today’s natural disasters, which kill good and bad people alike, destruction from God was selective.
Only the incorrigibly wicked or those who refused to listen to warnings were destroyed.
Third, God made a way for innocent people to escape. ​ — Genesis 7: 1, 23; 19: 15 - 17; Numbers 16: 23 - 27.
In the countless disasters that have wreaked havoc on the lives of millions of people today, there is no evidence that God was behind them.
What, then, accounts for the apparent increase in such disasters?
How can we cope with them?
And will there ever be a time when disasters are no more?
You will find the answers in the following articles.
DISASTERS seem to be very much in the news.
More people than ever before are the victims of one calamity or another.
The Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, in Belgium, reports that in 2010 alone there were 373 disasters and that at least 296,000 people died as a result.
The number of reported disasters has also climbed noticeably over the past several decades. For example, between 1975 and 1999, well under 300 disasters were recorded each year. However, between 2000 and 2010, the average was close to 400 per year.
Perhaps you are among those who wonder, ‘ Why are there so many disasters now? ’
Although people often label such disasters as “acts of God, ” this is really a misnomer.
God is not behind the calamities that affect so many people today.
Nevertheless, the Bible did foretell that there would be disasters in our time.
For example, at Matthew 24: 7, 8, we read Jesus ’ words: “There will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another.
All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress. ”
Why did Jesus foretell these events, and what meaning do they have for us?
God’s Son, Jesus, was speaking in answer to the question posed to him: “What will be the sign... of the conclusion of the system of things? ”
He told of various things that would happen, including calamities like those mentioned above. He then went on to make this significant statement: “When you see these things occurring, know that the kingdom of God is near. ”
Those natural disasters, therefore, have great significance for us.
They point to a time of momentous changes just ahead.
Nevertheless, many people still ask, If God is not responsible for the disasters, who or what is?
We can understand the answer only if we recognize an important truth mentioned in the Bible: “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one. ”
This verse reveals that it is not God who is behind the distressing conditions in the world, but in many cases, it is his enemy, “the wicked one ” ​ — otherwise referred to in the Bible as“ the Devil. ” ​ — Revelation 12: 9, 12.
Guided by his own self - serving objective, this enemy of God views people as disposable.
Since he has the whole world under his control, he has promoted that same spirit among mankind.
Indeed, the Bible points to this by foretelling that in “the last days, ” people will be“ lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self - assuming, haughty. ”
Hence, it is no surprise that the Devil has created a global system that thrives on those and other ungodly traits.
He encourages selfish and greedy exploitation that often puts people in harm’s way.
In what way does today’s greedy system promote disasters?
A United Nations report on global disasters states: “Populations are too often being concentrated in risky areas such as flood plains.
In addition, the destruction of forests and wetlands is harming the capacity of the environment to withstand hazards.
Looming above all this is the threat of global climate change and rising sea levels as a result of increased greenhouse gas concentrations... caused by human activity. ”
Though much of this “human activity ” is said to be for economic progress, it is in reality the work of the selfish and greedy spirit that permeates the world.
Consequently, many experts now recognize that indiscriminate human activity has intensified the devastating effects of the disasters that occur.
In reality, humans have played into the Devil’s hands by supporting a system that exacerbates disasters.
We see, then, that many disasters are the result of careless human activity.
Some disasters would not have been as devastating were it not for where they occurred.
In many parts of the world, the effects of natural disasters have been greatly aggravated by the underhanded dealings of unscrupulous individuals or by the fact that masses of people have been forced to live in hazardous areas as a result of the economic or social inequalities inherent in the world today.
Of course, some people suffer in disasters, not because of any particular person’s fault or negligence, but because “time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all. ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 9: 11.
Whatever the reason, should you be the victim of a natural disaster, how can you cope?
We will now take a look at what can be done to lessen the impact when calamities occur.
In view of the increase in both the frequency and the destructiveness of natural disasters, what can a person do to cope?
“Shrewd is the one that has seen the calamity and proceeds to conceal himself, but the inexperienced have passed along and must suffer the penalty, ” says the Bible.
This is wise counsel that can apply to disasters.
If a warning is given about an impending volcanic eruption, probable flooding, or an approaching hurricane or typhoon, wisdom dictates that those in the affected area evacuate and get to safer ground.
Life is more valuable than a house or other material things.
For some, it might be possible to choose not to live in an area of high risk.
One authority says: “Disaster risk is geographically highly concentrated.
A very small portion of the Earth’s surface contains most of the risk and most future large - scale disasters will occur in these areas. ”
This may be true, for example, in low - lying coastal regions or in areas near fault lines in the earth.
If you can avoid living in such high - risk areas or can move to a safer location, you may greatly reduce your risk of suffering from disasters.
In spite of all precautions taken, you may still find yourself a victim of an unexpected tragedy.
Coping with it will be much easier if you have planned in advance.
This is also in harmony with the advice at Proverbs 22: 3, quoted earlier.
Do you have an emergency kit prepared and ready to go?
The publication 1 - 2 - 3 of Disaster Education recommends including the following items: First - aid supplies, bottled water, nonperishable food, and important documents.
It would also be wise to review with your family the types of disasters that could take place and what could be done in each case.
This can help in any circumstance.
The Bible speaks of God as “the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation. ”
Another verse describes him as the God “who comforts those laid low. ” ​ — 2 Corinthians 1: 3, 4; 7: 6.
Yes, God is keenly aware of the circumstances coming upon those who put faith in him.
He is a God of love and provides uplifting encouragement in various ways.
Prayers, not for miracles but for God’s powerful holy spirit, can provide help in any situation.
The holy spirit can bring to mind Bible passages that can be comforting and soothing to those experiencing adversities.
Truly, God’s faithful servants can feel as did David, a king of ancient Israel, who said: “Even though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, I fear nothing bad, for you are with me; your rod and your staff are the things that comfort me. ” ​ — Psalm 23: 4.
The famine severely affected many of Jesus ’ disciples in Judea.
What did the disciples elsewhere do when they heard of their fellow Christians ’ plight?
The account states: “Those of the disciples determined, each of them according as anyone could afford it, to send a relief ministration to the brothers dwelling in Judea. ”
They lovingly responded by providing relief supplies.
When severe calamities occur today, God’s servants respond similarly.
Jehovah’s Witnesses are well - known for helping fellow believers.
For example, when a strong earthquake struck Chile on February 27, 2010, Jehovah’s Witnesses quickly responded to help those affected.
Karla, whose home was swept away by a tsunami, related: “It was comforting and encouraging to see that the very next day [fellow Witnesses] arrived from other areas to help us.
Without a doubt, Jehovah comforted us through the goodness of those volunteers.
I felt loved and protected. ”
Her grandfather, who is not a Witness, observed the help being given.
He said: “This is completely different from what I have seen for years in my church. ”
What he saw moved him to ask Jehovah’s Witnesses to study the Bible with him.
Fellow Christians help one another to deal with the effects of disasters
Being in association with those who love God can be a great aid during times of adversity.
Even so, will there ever be a time when the earth will be rid of the curse of disasters?
Let us see what the Bible has to say on this subject.
IF SOMEONE told you, “There will soon be no more disasters, ” how would you react?
You might reply, “You must be dreaming.
Disasters are just a fact of life. ”
Or you might just think to yourself, ‘ Whom does he think he’s kidding? ’
Even though natural disasters seem to be here to stay, there is a basis for real hope that this will change.
The change, however, will not come through human efforts.
Humans are not able to understand fully how and why things happen in nature, much less control or change them.
King Solomon of ancient Israel, noted for his wisdom and keen observation, wrote: “Mankind are not able to find out the work that has been done under the sun; however much mankind keep working hard to seek, yet they do not find out.
And even if they should say they are wise enough to know, they would be unable to find out. ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 8: 17.
If humans cannot control natural disasters, who can?
The Bible identifies our Creator as the one to make this change.
He is the One who put the earth’s ecological systems, such as the water cycle, in place.
And in sharp contrast with humans, God has unlimited power at his disposal.
Testifying to this fact, the prophet Jeremiah said: “O Sovereign Lord Jehovah!
Here you yourself have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm.
The whole matter is not too wonderful for you yourself. ”
Since God made the earth and all its elements, logically he knows how to manage things so that people can dwell on it in peace and security. ​ — Psalm 37: 11; 115: 16.
How, then, will God bring about the needed change?
You will recall that the second of this series of articles mentioned that the many terrifying things taking place on the earth today make up a “sign ” marking“ the conclusion of the system of things. ”
The Kingdom of God, a heavenly government of God’s making, will bring about big changes on the earth, even bringing natural elements under control.
Though Jehovah God has the power to do this himself, he has chosen to delegate the task to his Son.
Speaking of this one, the prophet Daniel said: “To him there were given rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him. ” ​ — Daniel 7: 14.
God’s Son, Jesus Christ, has been given the power necessary to bring about all the changes needed to make the earth a delightful place.
Two thousand years ago, when Jesus was on earth, he demonstrated on a small scale his ability to control the natural elements.
On one occasion, when he and his disciples were in a boat on the Sea of Galilee, “a great violent windstorm broke out, and the waves kept dashing into the boat, so that the boat was close to being swamped. ”
His disciples panicked. Fearing for their lives, they turned to Jesus.
What did Jesus do?
He simply “rebuked the wind and said to the sea: ‘ Hush!
Be quiet! ’
And the wind abated, and a great calm set in. ”
His disciples were amazed and asked: “Who really is this, because even the wind and the sea obey him? ” ​ — Mark 4: 37 - 41.
Since then, Jesus has been elevated to the spirit realm and has been given even greater power and authority.
As the King of God’s Kingdom, he has the responsibility as well as the ability to administer all the changes necessary to give people a peaceful and secure life on earth.
However, as we have seen, many of the problems and disasters are man - made, caused or made worse by the exploits of selfish and greedy individuals.
What will the Kingdom do about those who persist in such ways and refuse to change?
The Bible speaks of the Lord Jesus coming “from heaven with his powerful angels in a flaming fire, as he brings vengeance upon those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus. ”
Yes, he will “bring to ruin those ruining the earth. ” ​ — 2 Thessalonians 1: 7, 8; Revelation 11: 18.
Afterward, this “King of kings, ” Jesus Christ, will assert full control of earth’s elements.
He will make sure that the subjects of the Kingdom no longer suffer any calamities.
He will use his power to regulate the meteorological elements so that the weather and seasonal cycles will work to the benefit of mankind.
The result will be the realization of what Jehovah God long ago promised to his people: “I shall also certainly give your showers of rain at their proper time, and the land will indeed give its yield, and the tree of the field will give its fruit. ”
People will be able to build houses without fear of losing them in some calamity: “They will certainly build houses and have occupancy; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat their fruitage. ” ​ — Isaiah 65: 21.
No doubt you, like many others, are attracted to the idea of living in a world with no more devastating disasters.
What, though, do you have to do to be there?
Since “those who do not know God ” and“ those who do not obey the good news ” will not qualify to live in the disaster - free world to come, it is clear that one must now learn about God and support his arrangement for rulership of the earth.
God requires that we come to know him and obey the good news of the Kingdom that he has set up through his Son.
It contains the instructions for qualifying to live in the secure environment that will exist under Kingdom rulership.
Why not ask Jehovah’s Witnesses to help you learn what the Bible teaches? They are at your bidding for that very purpose.
One thing is sure ​ — if you make the effort to know God and to obey the good news, then the words of Proverbs 1: 33 will come true in your case: “As for the one listening to me, he will reside in security and be undisturbed from dread of calamity. ”
Learn From God’s Word
How Can We Choose Good Friends?
This article considers questions you may have raised and shows where you can read the answers in the Bible.
Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.
Why should we select friends carefully?
Most people like to be accepted by others. This desire often makes us imitate those around us.
So our friends have a powerful influence on the attitudes that develop in our heart.
Thus, our choice of friends can influence the sort of person we will become. ​ — Read Proverbs 4: 23; 13: 20.
The inspired Bible writer David selected his friends wisely.
He associated with those who helped him keep his integrity as a servant of God.
For example, David enjoyed Jonathan’s friendship because Jonathan encouraged him to trust Jehovah. ​ — Read 1 Samuel 23: 16 - 18.
How can you be God’s friend?
Although Jehovah is almighty, we can actually become his friends.
For example, Abraham became a friend of God.
Abraham trusted and obeyed Jehovah, so Jehovah considered him as a friend.
If we trust Jehovah and do what he tells us to do, we can also become friends of God. ​ — Read Psalm 15: 1, 2.
How can you benefit from good friends?
True friends are loyal and help you to do what is right.
For example, although Jonathan was likely 30 years older than David and would normally have been heir to the throne of Israel, he loyally supported David as the one chosen by God to be king.
True friends also have the courage to correct you if they see that you are acting foolishly.
Friends who love God will help you develop good habits. ​ — Read 1 Corinthians 15: 33.
You can meet people who share your love for what is right at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
There you will find friends who will encourage you in your efforts to please God. ​ — Read Hebrews 10: 24, 25.
However, even friends who love God may sometimes disappoint us.
Do not be easily offended by their mistakes.
Remember, no friend is perfect and friends who love God are valuable to us.
God’s Word urges us to overlook the faults of fellow Christians. ​ — Read Colossians 3: 13.
What if “friends ” oppose you?
Many people find that when they start receiving help to understand God’s Word, some of their old friends oppose them.
Perhaps such friends do not understand the practical counsel or the sure hope that you have found in the Bible.
Maybe you can help them. ​ — Read Colossians 4: 6.
In other cases, “friends ” may ridicule the good news presented in God’s Word.
Some may ridicule your efforts to do what is right.
If that happens to you, you may have to choose between being their friend and being God’s friend.
If you choose to be a friend of God, you will have chosen the best friend anyone can have. ​ — Read James 4: 4, 8.

Many servants of God in the past were filled with holy spirit.
In what ways did God’s spirit operate upon them?
Studying how Jehovah directed them will be of great encouragement to us in our service.

Why Be Guided by God’s Spirit? “You are my God.
Your spirit is good; may it lead me. ” ​ — PS.
143: 10.
Illustrate how an invisible force can guide a person.
HAVE you ever used a compass to find your way?
A compass is a simple device with only one moving part ​ — a magnetic needle pointing toward the north.
Because of an invisible force known as magnetism, the needle of the compass aligns itself with the magnetic field surrounding the earth between its poles.
For centuries, explorers and travelers have used the compass to guide their way over land and sea.
2, 3. (a) What powerful force did Jehovah use aeons ago?
(b) Why should we expect God’s invisible active force to guide our lives today?
There is another invisible force that is even more essential for our guidance.
What is it?
The one described in the opening verses of the Bible.
Speaking of what Jehovah accomplished aeons ago, Genesis states: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. ”
As he did so, he sent forth a powerful force, for the creation account adds: “God’s active force was moving to and fro. ”
What was at work?
Holy spirit ​ — the dynamic force behind creation.
We owe our existence to Jehovah’s use of this spirit to produce all his works. ​ — Job 33: 4; Ps.
104: 30.
As living, breathing humans, should we expect God’s active force to have any further effect on our lives?
God’s own Son knew that we should, for Jesus said to his disciples: “The spirit... will guide you into all the truth. ”
How are we to understand what this spirit is, and why should we want to be guided by it?
The Nature of Holy Spirit
4, 5. (a) What do Trinitarians wrongly think that the holy spirit is?
(b) How would you explain the true nature of holy spirit?
Likely, some of the people you talk to in the ministry believe in what the King James Version and some other Bible translations call the Holy Ghost.
Trinitarians wrongly think that this is a spirit person equal with God the Father.
It is noteworthy, however, that throughout The Webster Bible, an amended King James Version originally published in 1833, American lexicographer Noah Webster replaced “Holy Ghost ” with“ Holy Spirit. ”
Webster did so because he knew that in the Scriptures this expression did not mean “an apparition. ”
What, then, is the true nature of holy spirit?
A footnote at Genesis 1: 2 in the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures ​ — With References states: “Besides being translated ‘ spirit, ’ ruʹach [Hebrew] is also translated ‘ wind ’ and by other words that denote an invisible active force. ”
(Compare footnotes at Genesis 3: 8; 8: 1.) Just as wind is invisible but exerts force, so the immaterial, impersonal holy spirit is unseen but produces effects.
This spirit is energy from God projected and exerted on people or things to accomplish his will.
Is it hard to believe that such a marvelous force emanates from the holy Source, Almighty God?
Not at all! ​ — Read Isaiah 40: 12, 13.
What significant appeal did David make to Jehovah?
Can Jehovah continue to use his spirit to guide us through life?
He promised the psalmist David: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go. ”
Did David want that?
Yes, for he appealed to Jehovah: “Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.
Your spirit is good; may it lead me. ”
We should have the same desire and willingness to be guided by God’s spirit.
Why so?
Consider four reasons.
We Are Not Qualified to Guide Ourselves
7, 8. (a) Why are we not able to guide ourselves independent of God?
(b) Illustrate why we dare not try to find our own way through this wicked system of things.
First, we should want to be guided by God’s spirit because we are not capable of guiding ourselves.
“To guide ” means“ to direct in a course or show the way to be followed. ”
However, Jehovah did not create us with the ability to do that for ourselves, especially not in our imperfect condition.
His prophet Jeremiah wrote: “O Lord, I am conscious that a man’s way is not in himself: man has no power of guiding his steps. ”
And why not?
Jeremiah heard God’s analysis of why we are impaired when it comes to directing ourselves. Speaking of the person we are inside, Jehovah said: “The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate. Who can know it? ” ​ — Jer.
17: 9; Matt.
15: 19.
Would it not be foolhardy for an inexperienced person to set off alone, without a skilled guide and not so much as a compass, hiking deep into an uncharted wilderness?
Not knowing how to survive inhospitable conditions in the wild and not having the expertise to find his way safely to his destination, he would be putting his life in jeopardy.
So, too, the person who thinks he can direct his course through this wicked world without allowing God to show him the right way is placing his life in grave danger.
The only chance we have of traversing this system of things successfully is to make the same prayerful request to Jehovah that David did: “Let my steps take hold on your tracks, in which my footsteps will certainly not be made to totter. ”
How is it possible to receive such guidance?
As depicted on page 17, how can God’s spirit serve as a sure guide for us?
If we are humble and willing to depend on Jehovah, he will impart to us his holy spirit as a sure guide for our steps.
How will that active force help us?
Jesus explained to his disciples: “The helper, the holy spirit, which the Father will send in my name, that one will teach you all things and bring back to your minds all the things I told you. ”
As we regularly and prayerfully study God’s Word, including all the sayings of Christ, holy spirit will increase our comprehension of Jehovah’s deep wisdom, so that we can follow his will closely.
Additionally, at any unexpected turn in the road to life, the spirit will show us the way to go.
It will bring to mind Bible principles that we have already learned and help us to grasp how they apply in directing our next step.
Jesus Was Guided by God’s Spirit
10, 11.
What expectation did the only - begotten Son of God have regarding holy spirit, and what did he experience?
A second reason why we should want to be guided by holy spirit is that God led his own Son by it.
Before coming to earth, the only - begotten Son of God knew of the prophecy: “Upon him the spirit of Jehovah must settle down, the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and of mightiness, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah. ”
Just imagine how eager Jesus was to receive the help of God’s spirit while residing in the environment that he faced here on earth!
Jehovah’s words came true.
The Gospel record states what happened immediately after Jesus ’ baptism: “Now Jesus, full of holy spirit, turned away from the Jordan, and he was led about by the spirit in the wilderness. ”
There, while Jesus was fasting, praying, and meditating, Jehovah likely instructed and enlightened his Son about what lay ahead for him.
God’s active force was at work on Jesus ’ mind and heart, guiding his thinking and decisions.
As a result, Jesus knew what to do in each situation, and he did exactly what his Father wanted him to do.
Why is it necessary that we ask for God’s spirit to lead us?
Knowing the value of the effects of God’s spirit in his own life, Jesus impressed on his disciples the importance of their asking for and being led by holy spirit. (Read Luke 11: 9 - 13.)
Why is that so necessary for us?
Because it can transform our thinking, so that it resembles the mind of Christ.
By letting God’s spirit guide our lives, we can think as Christ does and imitate his example. ​ — 1 Pet. 2: 21.
The World’s Spirit Would Lead Us Astray
What is the world’s spirit, and what does it produce?
The third reason for wanting God’s spirit to guide us is that without it we could be led astray by the unholy spirit that is at work in the lives of most people today.
The world has its own powerful, impelling force that foments a course totally opposite of what holy spirit can produce in us.
Rather than fostering in people the mind of Christ, the world’s spirit causes their thinking and actions to resemble those of the ruler of the world, Satan.
(Read Ephesians 2: 1 - 3; Titus 3: 3.)
When a person gives in to the world’s spirit and takes up practicing the works of the flesh, grave consequences result, preventing him from inheriting God’s Kingdom. ​ — Gal.
5: 19 - 21.
14, 15.
How can we succeed in resisting the spirit of the world?
Jehovah has equipped us to resist the spirit of the world.
The apostle Paul said to “go on acquiring power in the Lord and in the mightiness of his strength... that you may be able to resist in the wicked day. ”
By means of his spirit, Jehovah fortifies us to withstand Satan’s efforts to mislead us.
The spirit of the world is strong, and we cannot avoid it altogether. However, we do not have to be corrupted by it. Holy spirit is even stronger, and it will help us!
Of those who forsook Christianity in the first century, the apostle Peter said: “Abandoning the straight path, they have been misled. ”
How very thankful we can be that we have received, “not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God ”!
With the help of its influence and by taking full advantage of all of Jehovah’s provisions to keep us on the right path spiritually, we can succeed in resisting the satanic spirit of this wicked world. ​ — Gal. 5: 16.
Holy Spirit Produces Good Fruitage
What fruitage can holy spirit produce in us?
A fourth reason for wanting God’s spirit to work within us is that it produces healthy fruitage in the lives of those who are led by it. (Read Galatians 5: 22, 23.)
Who among us would not want to be more loving, joyful, and peaceable?
Who of us would not like to abound in long - suffering, kindness, and goodness?
Who of us would not benefit from developing greater faith, mildness, and self - control?
God’s spirit produces in us fine qualities that benefit us and those with whom we live and serve.
Cultivating this fruitage is a constant work in progress, since there is no limit to the amount of the spirit’s fruitage that we need and are permitted to produce.
How can we cultivate an aspect of the fruitage of the spirit to a greater extent?
We are wise to take stock of ourselves to be sure that our words and actions give evidence that we are directed by holy spirit and are producing its fruitage.
If we see that we need to cultivate some aspects of the fruitage of the spirit, we can cooperate with holy spirit to a greater degree in producing such qualities.
We do this by studying each aspect as it is revealed through the pages of the Bible and discussed in our Christian publications.
Thus we can discern how the spirit’s fruitage should be manifested in our everyday life and then work to cultivate it to a greater extent.
* As we observe the results of the operation of God’s spirit in our own life as well as in the lives of our fellow Christians, we clearly see why we must be guided by it.
Are You Yielding to God’s Spirit?
How is Jesus a model for us in responding to God’s spirit?
As God’s “master worker ” in the creation of the physical universe, Jesus knew all about the earth’s magnetic field, which humans use to navigate the earth.
However, there is no evidence in the Bible that Jesus ever used that force to guide his way when he was on earth.
The Bible does report that as a human, he experienced what a powerful force God’s holy spirit was in his life.
He welcomed its influence, and when it impelled him, he yielded and acted accordingly.
Are you of that sort?
What must we do for holy spirit to become the guiding force in our life?
God’s active force still operates on willing minds and hearts to move and guide them.
How can you let it work upon you to lead you in the right direction?
Pray constantly to Jehovah that he send you his spirit and help you yield to its influence. (Read Ephesians 3: 14 - 16.)
Work in harmony with your prayers by searching out the counsel found in God’s written Word, the Bible ​ — a product of holy spirit.
Obey the wise instructions it offers, and then respond eagerly to the leading of holy spirit.
Act with faith in Jehovah’s ability to guide you properly through life in this wicked world.
In the preface of his Bible, Webster wrote: “Whenever words are understood in a sense different from that which they had when introduced, and different from that of the original languages, they do not present to the reader the Word of God. ”
For a discussion of each aspect, see the subject “Fruitage of God’s Spirit ” and the heading“ List by Aspect ” in the Watch Tower Publications Indexes.
Did You Get the Main Points?
• How can holy spirit affect our lives?
• What are four reasons why we should want to be guided by God’s spirit?
• How can we do our part to benefit fully from the leading of holy spirit?

Is He a Good Example for You or a Warning?
“The God of Jacob... will instruct us about his ways, and we will walk in his paths. ” ​ — ISA.
2: 3.
1, 2.
In what ways can you benefit from Bible examples?
ARE you not convinced that you can benefit from what is written in the Bible?
Therein you find examples of faithful men and women whose life course and qualities you would like to imitate.
However, you have likely noted warning examples also ​ — men and women whose deeds or attitudes you do well to avoid.
Actually, some individuals mentioned in the Bible stand out both as good examples of the course to follow and as warnings of what to shun.
Think of David, a humble shepherd and then a powerful king.
You find in him a good example of one who loved truth and trusted in Jehovah.
Yet, David was guilty of serious wrongs, such as those involving Bath - sheba, Uriah, and an ill - advised census.
Let us, though, focus on his son ​ — a king and also a Bible writer — ​ Solomon.
We will first note two ways in which he was a good example.
“The Wisdom of Solomon ”
Why can we say that Solomon set a good example for us?
The Greater Solomon, Jesus Christ, spoke favorably of King Solomon, setting him before us as a good example.
Jesus told some doubting Jews: “The queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, but, look!
something more than Solomon is here. ”
Yes, Solomon was famous for his wisdom, and he urged us to acquire it.
4, 5.
How did Solomon gain his wisdom, but how is our acquiring of wisdom different?
At the start of Solomon’s kingship, God appeared to him in a dream and invited him to make a request.
Aware of his limited experience, Solomon requested wisdom. (Read 1 Kings 3: 5 - 9.)
Pleased that the king asked for wisdom rather than for riches and glory, God gave Solomon “a wise and understanding heart ” ​ — as well as prosperity.
As Jesus mentioned, Solomon’s wisdom was so outstanding that the queen of Sheba heard of it and made a long trip to experience it for herself. ​ — 1 Ki.
10: 1, 4 - 9.
We personally do not expect to receive wisdom miraculously.
Solomon said that “Jehovah himself gives wisdom, ” but he wrote that we should strive to gain that godly quality:“ Pay attention to wisdom with your ear, that you may incline your heart to discernment. ”
Related to that, he used expressions such as “call out for, ”“ keep seeking for, ” and “keep searching for ” wisdom.
Clearly, we can gain wisdom.
In what ways may we show that we are benefiting from Solomon’s good example as to wisdom?
It would be good to ask, ‘ Am I taking to heart Solomon’s example of treasuring divine wisdom? ’
Economic uncertainties have moved many to concentrate on their job and finances or have influenced decisions about the type and amount of education to seek.
What about you and your family?
Do your choices indicate that you are treasuring and seeking divine wisdom?
Would adjusting your focus or goals allow you to acquire more wisdom?
Really, gaining and applying wisdom is for your lasting good.
Solomon wrote: “In that case you will understand righteousness and judgment and uprightness, the entire course of what is good. ” ​ — Prov.
2: 9.
Elevating True Worship Brought Peace
How did God come to have a grand temple?
Early in his reign, Solomon took steps to replace the tabernacle, in use since Moses ’ day, with a magnificent temple.
We may call it Solomon’s temple, but it was not his idea or his way to make a name for himself as an architect or a wealthy benefactor.
In fact, it was David who first proposed building a temple, whereupon God gave David detailed plans for the temple and its furnishings.
And David made a great contribution to finance the work.
Still, it fell on Solomon to carry out this building project that went on for seven and a half years. ​ — 1 Ki.
6: 37, 38; 7: 51.
8, 9. (a) We find in Solomon what good example as to persevering in good works?
(b) What resulted from Solomon’s elevating of true worship?
Thus Solomon set a good example for us of persevering in good works, and he kept the right focus.
When the temple was finished and the ark of the covenant was placed in it, Solomon offered a public prayer.
In part, he prayed to Jehovah: “[May your] eyes... prove to be opened toward this house night and day, toward the place of which you said, ‘ My name will prove to be there, ’ to listen to the prayer with which your servant prays toward this place. ”
Israelites and foreigners could pray toward this structure on which God’s name was called. ​ — 1 Ki.
8: 30, 41 - 43, 60.
What resulted from Solomon’s elevating of true worship?
After celebrating the temple’s inauguration, the people were “rejoicing and feeling merry of heart over all the goodness that Jehovah had performed for David his servant and for Israel. ”
In fact, remarkable peace and prosperity marked Solomon’s 40 - year reign.
(Read 1 Kings 4: 20, 21, 25.)
Psalm 72 reflects that and gives us insight into the blessings we will enjoy under the rule of the Greater Solomon, Jesus Christ. ​ — Ps.
72: 6 - 8, 16.
Solomon’s Warning Example
What failing on Solomon’s part may readily come to mind?
Why, though, can we say that Solomon’s life course is also a warning example?
You may think first of his foreign wives and concubines.
We read: “It came about in the time of Solomon’s growing old that his wives themselves had inclined his heart to follow other gods; and his heart did not prove to be complete with Jehovah. ”
Undoubtedly, you are determined never to imitate his foolish course.
But is that the only warning we find in Solomon’s life?
Consider some details of his life that are easily overlooked, and see what warning you find.
We can conclude what about Solomon’s first marriage?
Solomon reigned for 40 years.
Hence, what can you conclude from 1 Kings 14: 21?
According to that verse, upon Solomon’s death his son Rehoboam became king at age 41, his mother being “Naamah the Ammonitess. ”
This means that before Solomon became king, he married a foreigner from an enemy nation that served idol gods.
Did she worship them?
Even if she did at one time, she may have turned away from idols and may have become a true worshipper, as did Rahab and Ruth.
Still, Solomon likely came to have Ammonite in - laws and relatives who did not serve Jehovah.
12, 13.
Solomon made what poor decision early in his reign, and how might he have reasoned?
And things definitely took a bad turn after he became king.
Solomon formed “a marriage alliance with Pharaoh the king of Egypt and [took] Pharaoh’s daughter and [brought] her to the City of David. ”
Did this Egyptian woman imitate Ruth by taking up true worship?
Nothing indicates that she did so.
Rather, in time Solomon built a house for her (and perhaps her Egyptian maids) outside the City of David.
The Scriptures say that he did so because it was not fitting for a false worshipper to dwell near the ark of the covenant. ​ — 2 Chron.
8: 11.
Solomon may have seen political advantages in marrying an Egyptian princess, yet could he justify it?
Long before, God had forbidden the marrying of pagan Canaanites, even listing certain peoples.
Did Solomon reason that Egypt was not one of those listed nations?
Even if he reasoned that way, would such rationalizing be valid?
Actually, his course ignored the clear risk that Jehovah had mentioned ​ — that of turning an Israelite from true worship to false. ​ — Read Deuteronomy 7: 1 - 4.
How might we benefit from taking to heart Solomon’s warning example?
Will we let Solomon’s course be a warning example for us?
A sister might attempt to rationalize forming a romantic link that ignores God’s directive to marry “only in the Lord. ”
With similar rationalizing, one might share in extracurricular sports or clubs at school, underreport taxable income, or tell untruths when asked to reveal actions that could be embarrassing.
The point is, Solomon must have used imperfect reasoning to get around what God commanded, and that same danger exists for us.
How did Jehovah show mercy in dealing with Solomon, but what should we remember about that?
It is interesting that after mentioning Solomon’s marriage to that foreign princess, the Bible relates that God granted his request for wisdom, and He also added riches.
Solomon had ignored God’s instructions, yet there is no indication that Jehovah quickly rejected him as king or strongly disciplined him.
That accords with the fact that God realizes that we are imperfect humans, made from dust.
Remember though: Our actions can have consequences now or perhaps down the line.
So Many Wives!
In taking many wives, what was Solomon ignoring?
In the Song of Solomon, the king said admiringly of a certain virgin that she was more beautiful than 60 queens and 80 concubines.
If that refers to Solomon’s situation, he had acquired that many women at that point in his reign.
Even if most or all of them were true worshippers, God’s direction through Moses was that a king of Israel should “not multiply wives for himself, that his heart may not turn aside. ”
Again, though, Jehovah did not simply turn away from Solomon.
In fact, God still blessed Solomon, using him to compose the Bible book Song of Solomon.
What reality should we not ignore?
Does this suggest that Solomon could ignore God’s direction with impunity or that we can do so?
Rather, it shows that God’s forbearance can go on for some time.
Yet, that one of God’s people can ignore his direction with no immediate negative consequence does not mean that there will be no sad outcome eventually.
Recall what Solomon wrote: “Because sentence against a bad work has not been executed speedily, that is why the heart of the sons of men has become fully set in them to do bad. ”
He added: “I am also aware that it will turn out well with those fearing the true God, because they were in fear of him. ” ​ — Eccl.
8: 11, 12.
How did Solomon’s case illustrate the truth we find at Galatians 6: 7?
If only Solomon had kept heeding that divine truth!
Yes, he had done much good and had long enjoyed divine blessings.
But over time, he took one false step after another. A bad pattern developed.
How true what the apostle Paul was later inspired to write: “Do not be misled: God is not one to be mocked. For whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap ”!
In time, Solomon reaped sad fruitage from ignoring God’s direction.
We read: “King Solomon himself loved many foreign wives along with the daughter of Pharaoh, Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian and Hittite women. ”
Many of those likely remained attached to false gods, and Solomon was not immune.
He went astray and lost the favor of our patient God. ​ — Read 1 Kings 11: 4 - 8.
Learn From His Example ​ — Good and Bad
Why can you say that the Bible contains many good examples?
Jehovah kindly inspired Paul to write: “All the things that were written aforetime were written for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope. ”
Those written things include many good examples, men and women of outstanding faith.
Paul could say: “What more shall I say?
For the time will fail me if I go on to relate about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David as well as Samuel and the other prophets, who through faith defeated kingdoms in conflict, effected righteousness, obtained promises,... from a weak state were made powerful. ”
We can and should benefit from the good examples found in the Scriptures, following or imitating what is presented in those fine Biblical accounts.
20, 21.
Why are you determined to benefit from warning examples found in God’s Word?
Certain Bible accounts, however, include warning examples.
We can find some of those in the lives of men and women whom Jehovah at one point accepted and used as his servants.
As we read the Bible, we can note where and how some of God’s people went astray and thus became warning examples.
We can discern that some gradually developed wrong attitudes or tendencies, which eventually produced sad consequences.
How can we draw lessons from such accounts?
We may want to ask ourselves such questions as: ‘ How did that develop?
Might such a trend develop in my case?
What can I do to avoid that and instead to benefit from this warning example? ’
What Have You Learned?
• Why can you find both good examples and warning examples in the Bible?
• How did Solomon allow a bad pattern to develop in his life?
• How can you benefit from Solomon’s warning example?

Faithful Ones of Old ​ — Guided by God’s Spirit
“The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has sent me, even his spirit. ” ​ — ISA.
48: 16.
1, 2.
What is needed in order to demonstrate faith, and what encouragement will we find by considering faithful ones of old?
THOUGH it has been in evidence since the days of Abel, “faith is not a possession of all people. ”
So why does a person have this quality, and what enables him to be faithful?
To a large extent, faith follows the things heard from God’s Word.
It is an aspect of the fruitage of God’s holy spirit.
Therefore, to demonstrate and exercise faith, we need holy spirit.
It would be a mistake to conclude that men and women of faith are born that way, that faith comes naturally.
The exemplary servants we read about in the Bible were people “with feelings like ours. ”
They had doubts, insecurities, and weaknesses but “were made powerful ” by God’s spirit to face challenges.
By considering how Jehovah’s spirit operated on them, we today will be encouraged to continue in our course of faithfulness, living as we do at this time when our faith is under attack.
God’s Spirit Empowered Moses
3 - 5. (a) How do we know that Moses acted with the help of holy spirit?
(b) What does Moses ’ example teach us about Jehovah’s giving his spirit?
Of all humans alive in 1513 B.C.E., Moses was “by far the meekest. ”
This mild - tempered servant was entrusted with enormous responsibility in the nation of Israel.
God’s spirit empowered Moses to prophesy, judge, write, lead, and perform miracles.
(Read Isaiah 63: 11 - 14.)
Yet, at one point, Moses lamented that the load was simply too heavy.
So Jehovah took “away some of the spirit ” that was upon Moses and put it on 70 others to help carry the workload.
Although Moses ’ load seemed too heavy, he had, in fact, not been carrying it alone ​ — neither would the 70 who were appointed to assist him carry it alone.
Moses had been given holy spirit sufficient for the task.
After the change, Moses still had all the spirit that he needed.
Moses did not have too little, and the 70 older men did not have too much.
Jehovah supplies as much of his spirit as we need, according to our circumstances.
“He does not give the spirit by measure ” but gives“ from out of his fullness. ” ​ — John 1: 16; 3: 34.
Are you enduring trials?
Are legitimate demands on your time increasing?
Are you striving to provide for the spiritual and physical needs of your family while coping with rising expenses or anxieties over health?
Are you carrying weighty responsibilities in the congregation?
Be assured that by means of his spirit, God can give you the strength you need to cope with any situation. ​ — Rom.
15: 13. Holy Spirit Made Bezalel Qualified
6 - 8. (a) What did God’s spirit enable Bezalel and Oholiab to do?
(b) What shows that Bezalel and Oholiab were guided by God’s spirit?
(c) Why is Bezalel’s experience particularly encouraging?
The experience of Moses ’ contemporary Bezalel reveals much about the way God’s spirit can operate. (Read Exodus 35: 30 - 35.)
Bezalel was appointed to take the lead in making the necessary furnishings for the tabernacle.
Possibly, but in all likelihood his most recent job was that of making bricks for the Egyptians.
So how would Bezalel fulfill his complicated task?
Jehovah “proceeded to fill him with the spirit of God in wisdom, in understanding and in knowledge and in every sort of craftsmanship and for designing devices... to make ingenious products of every sort. ”
Whatever natural aptitude Bezalel may have had was enhanced by holy spirit. The same is true of Oholiab.
Bezalel and Oholiab must have learned well, for they not only performed their duties but also taught others what to do.
Yes, God put it into their hearts to teach. Another testimony that Bezalel and Oholiab were guided by God’s spirit is the amazing durability of their work.
Their productions were still in use some 500 years later.
Unlike modern - day manufacturers, Bezalel and Oholiab had no interest in leaving their signature or trademark on their work.
All credit went to Jehovah for their accomplishments. ​ — Ex.
36: 1, 2.
Today, we may be faced with daunting tasks requiring special skills, such as building, printing, organizing conventions, administering disaster relief, and communicating with doctors and hospital personnel about our Scriptural position on the use of blood.
At times, these deeds are performed by skilled workers, but more often they are carried out by volunteers without much background in a specific field.
God’s spirit makes their efforts succeed.
Have you held back from accepting an assignment in Jehovah’s service, feeling that others were more qualified than you?
Remember, Jehovah’s spirit can enhance your knowledge and abilities and help you to fulfill any assignment he gives you.
Joshua Succeeded With the Help of God’s Spirit
In what circumstance did the Israelites find themselves after the Exodus, and what question arose?
God’s spirit also guided a contemporary of Moses and Bezalel.
Shortly after the Exodus, the Amalekites launched an unprovoked attack on God’s people.
The time had come for the Israelites to repel the threat.
Although totally unaccustomed to war, the Israelites had to engage in their first military action as a freed people.
Someone was needed to lead the fighting force.
Who would it be?
Why did the Israelites under Joshua prove victorious in combat?
Joshua was chosen.
But if he had to state his previous work experience to qualify for that mission, what could he have listed?
Slave laborer?
Straw mixer?
Manna gatherer? True, Joshua’s grandfather Elishama was chieftain of the tribe of Ephraim and apparently led 108,100 men of one of the three - tribe divisions of Israel.
Yet, Jehovah directed through Moses that, neither Elishama nor his son Nun, but Joshua was to lead the force that would vanquish the enemy.
The battle lasted the greater part of a day.
With Joshua’s implicit obedience and his keen appreciation for the guidance of God’s holy spirit, Israel proved victorious. ​ — Ex.
17: 9 - 13.
How can we succeed in sacred service as Joshua did?
Later Joshua, “full of the spirit of wisdom, ” succeeded Moses.
Holy spirit did not produce in him the ability to prophesy or to perform miracles as it had in Moses, but it did enable Joshua to lead Israel in the military campaign that brought about the conquest of Canaan.
Today, we may feel inexperienced or underqualified to carry out certain aspects of our sacred service.
Yet, like Joshua, we are assured of success if we adhere closely to divine instruction. ​ — Josh.
1: 7 - 9.
“Jehovah’s Spirit Enveloped Gideon ”
12 - 14. (a) That 300 men could rout the overwhelming Midianite horde reveals what?
(b) How did Jehovah reassure Gideon?
(c) We receive what divine reassurance today?
After Joshua’s death, Jehovah continued to demonstrate how his power can strengthen faithful ones.
The book of Judges is replete with accounts of humans who “from a weak state were made powerful. ”
By means of holy spirit, God impelled Gideon to fight in behalf of His people.
The army Gideon assembled, however, was outnumbered by the Midianite menace 4 to 1.
In Jehovah’s eyes even that small Israelite regiment was far too numerous.
He twice decreed that Gideon scale back the army until the enemy outnumbered Israelite fighters 450 to 1.
These were odds that Jehovah favored.
If a stunning victory was to take place, who could brag that it was wrought by human effort or wisdom?
Gideon and his troops were almost ready.
Had you been part of that little band, would you have felt secure in the knowledge that your company had now been pruned of its fearful and less - than - vigilant ones?
Or would you have had a twinge of trepidation as you contemplated how matters might work out?
We do not have to guess how Gideon felt. He did what he was told to do!
(Read Judges 7: 9 - 14.)
Jehovah did not reproach Gideon for having asked for a sign as evidence that God would be with him.
Rather, he strengthened Gideon’s faith.
Jehovah’s power to save is infinite.
He can deliver his people from any predicament, even doing so by using those who appear weak or helpless.
Sometimes we may feel outnumbered or in desperate straits.
We do not expect miraculous affirmation such as Gideon received, but we can draw abundant guidance and reassurance from God’s Word and through his spirit - directed congregation.
Jehovah’s loving promises fortify our faith and convince us that he really is our Helper!
“Jehovah’s Spirit Now Came Upon Jephthah ”
15, 16.
Why did Jephthah’s daughter have a fine attitude, and how is this encouraging to parents?
Consider another example.
When the Israelites had to confront the Ammonites in battle, Jehovah’s spirit “came upon Jephthah. ”
Eager for victory to Jehovah’s praise, Jephthah made a vow that proved costly.
He vowed that if God gave Ammon into Jephthah’s hand, the first one to come out of the door when he returned home would be Jehovah’s.
As Jephthah returned from subduing Ammon, his daughter came running to meet him.
Did this come as a surprise to Jephthah?
Not likely, for he had but one child.
He fulfilled his vow by devoting his daughter to exclusive service at Jehovah’s sanctuary at Shiloh.
Being a loyal worshipper of Jehovah, Jephthah’s daughter was convinced that her father’s vow should be carried out.
(Read Judges 11: 36.)
Jehovah’s spirit gave both of them the strength they needed.
How had Jephthah’s daughter developed such a spirit of self - sacrifice?
No doubt her faith was built up as she observed her father’s zeal and godly devotion.
Parents, your example does not go unnoticed by your children.
Your decisions communicate that you believe what you say.
Your children observe how your fervent prayers and effective teaching combine with your example of what it means to serve Jehovah with a complete heart.
As your children do so, they will likely develop a strong desire to make themselves available to Jehovah for his service.
This is a cause for rejoicing.
“Jehovah’s Spirit Became Operative Upon ” Samson
What did Samson do by means of God’s spirit? Consider another example.
When Israel fell captive to the Philistines, “in time Jehovah’s spirit started to impel ” Samson to deliver Israel.
Samson was empowered to perform deeds of astonishing, incomparable strength.
When the Philistines persuaded Samson’s fellow Israelites to capture him, “Jehovah’s spirit became operative upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms came to be like linen threads that have been scorched with fire, so that his fetters melted off his hands. ”
Even from the physically weakened state brought on by his own poor judgment, Samson was made powerful “through faith. ”
Jehovah’s spirit operated on Samson in a unique way because of unusual circumstances.
Still, these historical events are of great encouragement to us.
How so?
18, 19. (a) Samson’s experience provides what assurance for us?
(b) How have you benefited from considering the examples of faithful ones in this article?
We rely on the same holy spirit that Samson did.
We do so as we carry out the work Jesus gave his followers, namely, “to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness. ”
How grateful we are that Jehovah uses his spirit to enable us to accomplish the wide variety of tasks that we are entrusted with!
Thus, as we carry out our commission, we can say as did the prophet Isaiah: “The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has sent me, even his spirit. ”
Yes, it is God’s spirit that has sent us!
We set our hearts to the work with the assurance that Jehovah will enhance our qualifications as he did for Moses, Bezalel, and Joshua.
We take up “the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word, ” confident that he will empower us as he empowered Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson.
By leaning on Jehovah for his help in overcoming obstacles, we can be as mighty spiritually as Samson was physically.
Clearly, Jehovah blesses those who take a bold stand for true worship.
As we respond to the operation of God’s holy spirit, our faith abounds.
It will be a pleasure, therefore, to review also some of the exciting events recorded in the Christian Greek Scriptures.
That will reveal how Jehovah’s spirit operated upon his faithful servants in the first century, both before and after Pentecost 33 C.E.
Why are you encouraged to know how God’s spirit operated upon...
• Moses?
• Bezalel?
• Joshua?
• Gideon?
• Jephthah?
• Samson?

Parents, your zealous example resonates with your children
Guided by God’s Spirit in the First Century and Today
“All these operations the one and the same spirit performs. ” ​ — 1 COR.
12: 11. What points will we consider in this study?
PENTECOST. What thrilling events that one word brings to mind!
The outpouring of holy spirit on that occasion in the first century marked a momentous change in God’s dealings with his servants.
In the preceding article, we considered some of the ways in which God’s spirit enabled faithful ones of old to carry out difficult and detailed assignments.
But what is the difference between the way God’s spirit operated in pre - Christian times and the way it worked in the first century?
And how do Christians benefit from the action of God’s holy spirit today?
Jehovah’s Slave Girl! ”
How had Mary seen the effect of holy spirit?
Yet, for more than three decades prior to that event, she had seen the effect of Jehovah’s spirit in remarkable ways.
Jehovah had transferred his Son’s life from heaven to earth, causing conception in Mary’s womb while she was still a virgin. What had been begotten in her was “by holy spirit. ” ​ — Matt. 1: 20.
3, 4.
What attitude did Mary display, and how might we imitate her?
Why had Mary been favored with that unparalleled privilege?
Jehovah’s slave girl! May it take place with me according to your declaration. ” In stating matters that way, Mary revealed a heart attitude that God had already noted.
Her immediate response indicates that she was ready to accept his will in the matter.
She did not raise any question about how people in the community would view her pregnancy or what possible effect it could have on her relationship with her fiancé.
By referring to herself as the lowliest of servants, Mary showed that she trusted completely in Jehovah as her Master.
Have you at times felt somewhat overwhelmed by challenges or responsibilities in God’s service?
Each of us does well to ask himself: ‘ Do I completely trust in Jehovah to work matters out in harmony with his will?
Am I truly demonstrating a willing spirit? ’
Be assured that God gives his spirit to those who trust in him with all their heart and recognize his sovereign will. ​ — Acts 5: 32.
Peter Was Helped by Holy Spirit
In what ways had Peter seen holy spirit at work before Pentecost 33 C.E.?
Like Mary, the apostle Peter had personally experienced the powerful operation of God’s holy spirit prior to Pentecost 33 C.E.
Jesus had given him and the other apostles authority to expel demons.
And although the Scriptures do not provide many details, it seems likely that Peter used that authority.
God’s power was also made manifest when Jesus invited Peter to walk toward him over the Sea of Galilee, and Peter did so. (Read Matthew 14: 25 - 29.)
Obviously, Peter relied on holy spirit to help him perform mighty deeds.
Soon that spirit would act on Peter and his fellow disciples in new ways.
By means of God’s spirit, what could Peter do during and after Pentecost 33 C.E.?
At the Festival of Pentecost 33 C.E., Peter and others were given the miraculous ability to communicate in the languages spoken by the sojourners visiting Jerusalem.
Thereafter, Peter took the lead in addressing the assembly.
Yes, this man who on occasion was impetuous or fearful was imbued with courage to give a bold witness despite threats and persecution.
He received knowledge by divine revelation.
And he was even empowered to perform a resurrection. ​ — Acts 9: 40.
What teachings of Jesus became clear to Peter only after his anointing?
Even prior to Pentecost, Peter got the sense of many truths that Jesus taught.
But there were aspects of Jesus ’ teachings that remained unclear to him before Pentecost.
For instance, Peter had not discerned that Christ would be resurrected as a spirit on the third day; nor had Peter grasped that the Kingdom would be in heaven.
The concept of humans becoming spirit creatures and ruling in a heavenly Kingdom was foreign to Peter.
Once he himself was baptized with holy spirit and given the heavenly hope, he could grasp the meaning of Jesus ’ teachings on those points.
Both the anointed and the “other sheep ” have what knowledge available?
Insight previously unattainable to Jesus ’ disciples became available after the outpouring of holy spirit.
By inspiration, the writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures set out ​ — for our benefit — ​ amazing facets of Jehovah’s purpose.
Today, both spirit - anointed ones and those of the “other sheep ” feed together spiritually, assimilating these same truths.
Do you cherish the knowledge and understanding of God’s Word that holy spirit thus makes available to you?
Paul Became “Filled With Holy Spirit ”
Paul was able to accomplish what by means of holy spirit?
A year or so after Pentecost 33 C.E., someone else received God’s gift of the holy spirit.
That was Saul, who became known as Paul.
The spirit operated on him in ways that benefit us today.
The apostle Paul was inspired to write 14 books of the Bible.
And as was true of Peter, God’s spirit enabled Paul to understand and write with clarity about the hope of immortality and incorruptibility in the heavens.
By holy spirit, Paul effected cures, expelled demons, and even raised the dead!
However, the power received through holy spirit had a more important purpose, one that all of God’s servants today experience, though not miraculously.
How did holy spirit affect Paul’s ability to speak?
Paul, who was “filled with holy spirit, ” spoke boldly against a sorcerer.
What an effect that had on the principal administrator of Cyprus, who was listening to the whole conversation!
That proconsul accepted the truth, “as he was astounded at the teaching of Jehovah. ”
Clearly, Paul knew well the importance of God’s holy spirit when it comes to speaking the truth.
He later entreated the congregation in Ephesus to make supplication for him that “ability to speak ” might be given him. ​ — Eph. 6: 18 - 20.
How was Paul guided by God’s spirit?
Not only did holy spirit enable Paul to speak but, at times, it forbade him to speak in certain localities.
As he embarked on his missionary journeys, Paul was guided by God’s spirit.
“Varieties of Operations ”
12 - 14.
Does God’s spirit work on all his servants in the same way?
Do accounts of Jehovah’s blessing on the first - century congregation of anointed ones provide significant encouragement to God’s dedicated servants today?
Without a doubt! Bear in mind Paul’s inspired words to the congregation in Corinth concerning the miraculous gifts of the spirit in his day: “Now there are varieties of gifts, but there is the same spirit; and there are varieties of ministries, and yet there is the same Lord; and there are varieties of operations, and yet it is the same God who performs all the operations in all persons. ”
Yes, holy spirit can operate in different ways on different servants of God for a purpose.
Indeed, the holy spirit is available both to Christ’s “little flock ” and to his“ other sheep. ”
Yet, it does not always operate in the same way on each member of the congregation.
Elders, for instance, are appointed by holy spirit.
But not all spirit - anointed ones serve as overseers in the congregation.
What are we to conclude from this?
Simply that God’s spirit operates in different ways on members of the congregation.
The spirit that instills in anointed ones “a spirit of adoption, ” or a sense of sonship, is the same spirit by which Jehovah raised his only - begotten Son from the dead to immortal life in heaven.
(Read Romans 8: 11, 15.)
It is the same spirit by which Jehovah brought the entire universe into existence.
By that same holy spirit, Jehovah qualified Bezalel for special work on the tabernacle, empowered Samson to perform deeds requiring outstanding strength, and enabled Peter to walk on water.
Let us, therefore, not confuse having God’s spirit with being anointed with God’s spirit, the latter being just one special operation of the spirit.
Spirit anointing depends on God’s choice.
Will baptism with holy spirit continue indefinitely? Explain.
God’s holy active force has been operating in various ways upon his faithful servants for as long as he has had faithful servants, yes, for thousands of years before spirit anointing began.
At Pentecost 33 C.E., that new operation began, but it will not continue forever.
Baptism with spirit will cease, but holy spirit will continue to operate on God’s people so that they may do his will for all eternity.
What are God’s servants doing now by means of his spirit?
What in particular is now taking place on earth by means of Jehovah’s holy spirit?
Revelation 22: 17 answers: “The spirit and the bride keep on saying: ‘ Come! ’
And let anyone hearing say: ‘ Come! ’
And let anyone thirsting come; let anyone that wishes take life’s water free. ”
Moved by God’s spirit, Christians today extend Jehovah’s life - giving invitation to “anyone that wishes ” to accept life’s water.
Anointed Christians are taking the lead in doing this.
Yet, those of the other sheep join in extending this invitation.
Both classes cooperate with the same holy spirit in accomplishing this work.
Those of both classes have symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by being baptized “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit. ”
And all of them yield to the action of God’s spirit in their lives, allowing it to produce in them its fruitage.
Like the anointed, the other sheep allow God’s spirit to help them.
With its help, they do their utmost to measure up to Jehovah’s requirements of holiness. ​ — 2 Cor.
7: 1; Rev. 7: 9, 14. Keep Asking for Holy Spirit How might we give proof that we have God’s spirit?
So whether your God - given hope is that of everlasting life in heaven or on earth, Jehovah can supply you with “power beyond what is normal ” in order for you to maintain your integrity and receive your reward.
Your continued preaching of the good news of the Kingdom may draw ridicule.
But remember that “if you are being reproached for the name of Christ, you are happy, because the spirit of glory, even the spirit of God, is resting upon you. ” ​ — 1 Pet. 4: 14.
18, 19.
How will Jehovah help you by means of his holy spirit, and what is your determination in this regard?
Holy spirit is God’s free gift to those who sincerely seek it.
It can enhance not only your abilities but also your desire to do your best in his service.
“God is the one that, for the sake of his good pleasure, is acting within you in order for you both to will and to act. ”
The precious gift of holy spirit, coupled with our earnest efforts to keep “a tight grip on the word of life, ” will allow us to“ keep working out [our] own salvation with fear and trembling. ” ​ — Phil. 2: 12, 13, 16.
With complete confidence in God’s spirit, then, pour your heart into every assignment, become skilled at what you are given to do, and look to Jehovah for assistance.
He will give you what you need to understand his Word, cope with life’s problems, and preach the good news.
“Keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you, ” and this includes receiving holy spirit.
Indeed, keep on supplicating Jehovah that you may be like faithful ones ​ — both ancient and modern — ​ who were guided by God’s holy spirit.
• Like Mary, what attitude can we display that will bring blessings?
• In what sense was Paul guided by God’s spirit?
• How are God’s servants guided by God’s spirit today?

Do Not Let Illness Rob You of Joy
PICTURE yourself waking up wishing that the day would end before it has even begun.
You have to cope with physical or emotional pain yet another day.
You may even feel like Job, who said: “I would prefer death to all my sufferings. ”
What if such a condition persists, even for years?
That was the case with Mephibosheth, the son of King David’s friend Jonathan.
When Mephibosheth was five years old, he “had a fall and was lamed. ”
Emotional distress must have increased the pain of his disability when he was later falsely accused of betraying the king and then suffered a material loss.
Yet, he consistently showed himself to be a wonderful example in coping with infirmity, slander, and disappointments, not letting such rob him of joy. ​ — 2 Sam.
9: 6 - 10; 16: 1 - 4; 19: 24 - 30.
The apostle Paul is another example.
He once wrote about “a thorn in the flesh ” with which he had to contend.
The thorn he mentioned might have been a long - term disability, or it could have been the people who challenged his apostleship.
Whatever the case, the problem lingered, and he had to deal with the physical or emotional pain it brought. ​ — 2 Cor. 12: 9, 10.
Debilitating chronic illnesses or emotional stresses plague some of God’s servants today. At the age of 18, Magdalena was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease in which the body’s immune defenses seem to attack its own organs.
“I was terrified, ” she says.
“As time went by, my condition worsened and was aggravated by digestive disorders, mouth ulcers, and thyroid problems. ”
Izabela, on the other hand, has to put up with conditions that are not so obvious.
She explains: “From childhood I have suffered from depression.
This has resulted in panic attacks, breathing problems, and stomach cramps.
Facing Reality
Sickness and infirmity can upset your life.
When that happens, it helps to sit down and honestly appraise your situation.
Accepting your limitations may not be easy.
Magdalena says: “My disease is progressive.
I often feel too exhausted to get out of bed. The unpredictable nature of my disease makes planning ahead very difficult.
My greatest frustration is that I can no longer do as much as I used to do in Jehovah’s service. ”
Zbigniew explains: “As the years go by, rheumatoid arthritis saps my energy, damaging one joint after another.
At times, when the inflammation is severe, I am unable to perform the simplest of tasks.
That leaves me feeling dejected. ”
Some years ago, Barbara was diagnosed with a progressive brain tumor.
“My body has undergone sudden changes, ” she comments.
“I feel listless, experience frequent headaches, and encounter concentration problems.
Because of my newfound limitations, I had to reevaluate everything. ”
All these individuals are dedicated servants of Jehovah. For them, doing his will takes priority.
They put their complete trust in God and benefit from his support. ​ — Prov.
3: 5, 6.
Jehovah Helps ​ — How?
We should avoid thinking that a personal affliction is evidence of God’s displeasure.
Think of what Job had to go through despite being “blameless and upright. ”
God does not try anyone with evil things.
All illnesses ​ — including the chronic and the emotional — ​ are a dismal legacy from our first parents, Adam and Eve. ​ — Rom.
5: 12.
Especially at difficult moments in our lives, we come to appreciate that God is ‘ our refuge and our stronghold. ’
So, then, when coping with conditions that have no easy solution, what can help you to maintain joy?
Prayer: Following the pattern of God’s faithful servants of old, you can throw your burden on our heavenly Father in prayer.
In doing so, you can experience “the peace of God that excels all thought. ” That inner peace“ will guard your hearts and your mental powers. ”
By relying on God through prayer, Magdalena copes with her debilitating disease.
She says: “Pouring out my heart to Jehovah brings relief and restores my joy.
Now I really understand what it means to rely on God day by day. ” ​ — 2 Cor. 1: 3, 4.
In response to your prayers, Jehovah can give you strength by means of his holy spirit, his Word, and the Christian brotherhood.
You would not expect God to remove your infirmity miraculously. Yet, you can count on him to give you the wisdom and strength needed to cope with each adversity.
4: 7.
Family: A loving and compassionate atmosphere at home can help you to endure illness.
Bear in mind, though, that your loved ones also suffer. They may feel as helpless as you feel.
Still, they are there for you, even in trying times.
Praying together will help you keep a calm heart. ​ — Prov.
14: 30.
Barbara says regarding her daughter and other young sisters in the congregation: “They support me in the ministry.
Their zeal warms my heart. ”
Zbigniew finds his wife’s support invaluable. “She looks after most of the household chores.
She also helps me get dressed and often carries my bag to the Christian meetings and in the ministry. ”
Fellow believers: When we are in company with our fellow believers, we are encouraged and consoled.
But what if you cannot attend meetings because of your illness?
Magdalena comments: “The congregation has made sure that I benefit from the meetings by means of audio recordings.
My fellow worshippers often call me to see what else they can do to help.
They also send me encouraging letters.
The thought that they remember me and are concerned about my well - being helps me to endure. ”
Izabela, who suffers from depression, relates: “Within the congregation, I have many ‘ fathers ’ and ‘ mothers, ’ those who listen and try to understand me.
The congregation is my family ​ — here is where I experience peace and joy. ”
Those who suffer various trials do well to avoid ‘ isolating themselves. ’
Rather, they treasure their association with the congregation.
They thus become a huge source of encouragement to others.
You may hesitate at first to let the brothers and sisters know of your needs. Yet, your fellow believers will appreciate your frankness.
It will afford them an opportunity to extend “unhypocritical brotherly affection. ” Why not let them know that you need a ride to the meeting, would like to work with them in the ministry, or want to have a heart - to - heart conversation?
Of course, we should not be demanding but be appreciative of their help.
Be positive: The key to coping with chronic illness without losing joy is often in your own hands.
A gloomy disposition and despondent feelings can lead to negative thinking.
The Bible states: “The spirit of a man can put up with his malady; but as for a stricken spirit, who can bear it? ” ​ — Prov.
18: 14.
Magdalena notes: “I work hard to avoid focusing on my problems.
I try to enjoy the days when I do feel better.
I find encouragement in reading the life stories of people who have remained faithful despite chronic illness. ”
Izabela is strengthened by the thought that Jehovah loves and values her.
She says: “I feel needed, and I have someone to live for.
I also have a wonderful prospect for the future. ”
Zbigniew says: “My illness teaches me humility and obedience. It teaches me to show insight and good judgment as well as to forgive from the heart.
I have learned to enjoy serving Jehovah without feelings of self - pity.
In fact, I have been motivated to keep on making spiritual progress. ”
Keep in mind that Jehovah carefully notes your endurance. He feels for you in your suffering and cares for you. He will not “forget your work and the love you showed for his name. ”
Take to heart the promise he makes to all who fear him: “I will by no means leave you nor by any means forsake you. ” ​ — Heb.
13: 5. If on occasion you do feel down, focus on the wonderful hope of living in the new world.
The time is fast approaching when your own eyes will see on the earth the blessings of God’s Kingdom!

They Keep Preaching Despite Chronic Illness
“I can no longer walk by myself, so my wife or some other brothers and sisters accompany me in the ministry.
I memorize presentations and Bible scriptures. ” ​ — Jerzy, visually impaired.
“In addition to doing telephone witnessing, I write letters and regularly correspond with a few interested ones.
While in the hospital, I always put the Bible and publications next to my bed.
That has helped me to strike up many good conversations. ” ​ — Magdalena, diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus.
“I like the door - to - door ministry, but when I am not feeling up to it, I engage in telephone witnessing. ” ​ — Izabela, suffers from clinical depression.
“I enjoy making return visits and helping out on Bible studies.
On my better days, I like to witness from house to house. ” ​ — Barbara, who has a brain tumor.
“I carry only a very light magazine bag.
I stay out as long as my aching joints allow. ” ​ — Zbigniew, rheumatoid arthritis patient.

Young and old can be sources of encouragement
Making Adjustments Has Been Rewarding
As told by James A.
When I was born in the southern United States in 1928, segregation of whites and blacks was the law. Breaking it could lead to imprisonment or worse.
AT THAT time in parts of the United States, white and black Jehovah’s Witnesses had to have separate congregations, circuits, and districts.
In 1937 my father became company servant (now called coordinator of the body of elders) of the black congregation in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Henry Nichols was company servant of the white one.
I have pleasant memories of when I was a youth sitting on our back porch at night and listening to Father and Brother Nichols talk.
While I did not understand everything they were talking about, I enjoyed being at Father’s side as the two discussed how best to carry on the preaching work under the existing circumstances.
Earlier, in 1930, tragedy hit our family.
Mother, who was just 20 years old, died. Father was left to take care of my four - year - old sister, Doris, and me, only two years old.
Although Father had only recently been baptized, he made good spiritual progress.
Examples That Shaped My Life
In 1933, Father met a wonderful Christian sister named Lillie Mae Gwendolyn Thomas, and they soon married.
Both Father and Mother set a good example for Doris and me in loyally serving Jehovah.
Congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses were asked in 1938 to support a resolution that elders in local congregations be appointed from our headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, instead of being elected locally.
When some in Chattanooga hesitated to accept the change, Father declared his unconditional support of the organizational adjustment.
His example of loyalty ​ — along with Mother’s wholehearted cooperation — ​ has helped me to this day.
Baptism and Full - Time Ministry
In 1940 several in our congregation rented a bus and traveled to the convention held in Detroit, Michigan.
A few in our bus group got baptized there.
Some wondered why I did not, as I had been preaching since the age of five and was very active in the ministry.
When they asked me about it, I replied, “I don’t understand all that is involved in baptism. ”
From then on, he made extra effort to help me understand what baptism means and its importance.
On a very cold day four months later, October 1, 1940, I was baptized in a pond outside of Chattanooga.
At age 14, I began pioneering during summer vacations from school.
I preached in small towns in Tennessee and the neighboring state of Georgia.
I would get up early, pack a lunch, and catch a 6: 00 a.m. train or bus to the territory. I returned about 6: 00 p.m.
The food I packed was often gone long before lunchtime.
Although I had money, I could not enter a local store to purchase any more food because I was black.
One time, I entered a store to get an ice - cream cone and was asked to leave.
A white woman kindly brought one out to me.
As I entered high school, the civil rights movement was picking up momentum in the South.
Organizations such as the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) encouraged student activism.
We were urged to become members. Several black schools, including mine, made it a goal to have 100 - percent membership.
I was pressured to “support our race, ” as it was put.
But I refused, explaining that God is impartial and does not favor one race over another.
Shortly after finishing high school, I decided to move to New York City.
On the way, however, I stopped in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to visit with friends whom I had met earlier at a convention.
The congregation there was the first racially mixed one that I attended.
During his visit, the traveling overseer took me aside and said that I was being assigned a part on the next meeting.
That made it easier for me to decide to stay there.
Among the friends I made in Philadelphia was a young sister named Geraldine White ​ — Gerri, as I came to call her.
She knew the Bible well and was adept at communicating with householders in the door - to - door ministry.
Especially important to me was that she shared my goal of becoming a pioneer. We were married on April 23, 1949.
Invited to Gilead
Our goal from the start was to attend Gilead School and serve as missionaries in a foreign country.
We were happy to adjust our circumstances to qualify for Gilead.
Shortly, we were asked to move to Lawnside, New Jersey; then to Chester, Pennsylvania; and finally to Atlantic City, New Jersey.
While in Atlantic City, we qualified to apply for Gilead, having been married for two years.
But our invitation was put on hold. What was the reason?
During the early part of the 1950 ’ s, many young men were being drafted to serve in the military and fight in the conflict going on in Korea.
The draft board in Philadelphia seemed prejudiced against Jehovah’s Witnesses because of our neutrality.
Finally, I was informed by a judge that a background check on me by the FBI had substantiated my neutral stand.
So on January 11, 1952, the Presidential Appeal Board granted me a 4 - D classification as a minister.
In August of that year, Gerri and I received an invitation to attend the 20th class of Gilead, which started in September.
During our studies, we anticipated receiving a foreign assignment.
My sister, Doris, had graduated from the 13th class of Gilead and was serving in Brazil.
How surprised Gerri and I were to receive an assignment to the circuit work ​ — visiting black congregations in the southern state of Alabama!
That disappointed us somewhat, for our hearts had been set on serving in a foreign land.
The first congregation we visited was in Huntsville.
Upon arriving, we went to the home of a Christian sister with whom we were to stay.
As we were unloading our things, we overheard her say on the telephone, “The children are here. ”
We were only 24 and looked even younger.
The nickname The Children stuck as we served that circuit.
The South was often referred to as the Bible Belt because most people there held the Bible in high regard.
So we frequently opened conversations with this three - point presentation:
(1) A brief comment on world conditions.
(2) The remedy the Bible provides.
(3) What the Bible says we must do.
Then we offered an appropriate Bible study aid.
Because of the success of this approach, I was assigned a part at the 1953 New World Society Assembly in New York.
There I demonstrated that three - point presentation. Soon, in the summer of 1953, I was assigned to serve black circuits in the South as district overseer.
Our territory covered the whole area from Virginia to Florida and as far west as Alabama and Tennessee.
Yes, traveling overseers needed to be adaptable.
For example, we often stayed in homes that had no indoor plumbing and bathed in a tin tub behind the kitchen stove.
Happily, that was the warmest part of the house!
The Challenge of Racial Segregation Serving in the South required forethought and ingenuity to get things done.
Blacks were not allowed to use Laundromats. So Gerri would go there and explain that the clothes were for “Mrs.
Thompson. ” Many seemed to think that she was a servant and that “Mrs. Thompson ” was the lady of the house.
When district overseers were showing the film The New World Society in Action, I would telephone the shop and reserve a large screen for “Mr.
Thompson. ” Later, I went to the shop and picked it up. We were always polite and generally fulfilled our ministry without trouble.
There was another form of prejudice, a regional one, against those from the North. A local newspaper once reported that James A.
Thompson, Jr., of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York would be speaking at an assembly.
Some read this to mean that I was from New York, and our contract for the use of a school auditorium was canceled.
So I went to the school board and explained that I had gone to school in Chattanooga.
We were then granted permission for our circuit assembly.
Racial tension was heating up in the mid - 1950 ’ s, and sometimes there was violence. In 1954, some Witnesses took offense when no black speakers were on the program at a number of district assemblies.
We encouraged our black brothers to be patient.
The following summer, I was assigned as a speaker. Thereafter, more black brothers in the South were on the programs.
In time, racial violence in the South diminished, and congregations gradually began to integrate.
This required reassigning publishers to different congregations as well as adjusting congregation territories and the responsibilities of brothers having oversight.
Some, both blacks and whites, did not favor the new arrangement.
The majority, however, were impartial, as is our heavenly Father.
In fact, many were close friends regardless of color.
Our family had experienced that in the 1930 ’ s and 1940 ’ s while I was growing up.
A New Assignment
In January 1969, Gerri and I received an invitation to go to Guyana, South America, and we happily accepted it.
First we went to Brooklyn, New York, where I received training to take oversight of the preaching work in Guyana. We arrived there in July 1969.
After 16 years in the traveling work, it was a big adjustment to be situated in one place.
Gerri spent most of her days in the field ministry as a missionary, and I worked at the branch office.
My work involved everything from cutting the grass and handling literature needs for the 28 congregations to corresponding with headquarters in Brooklyn.
I was working 14 to 15 hours each day.
It was hard work for both of us, but we enjoyed our assignment.
When we arrived, there were 950 publishers in Guyana; today there are over 2,500.
Although we enjoyed pleasant temperatures and exotic fruits and vegetables, our true joy was that humble people who yearned for Bible truth were learning about God’s Kingdom.
Often Gerri would conduct 20 weekly Bible studies, and many with whom we studied progressed to baptism.
Some, in time, became pioneers, congregation elders, and even went to Gilead to become missionaries themselves.
Challenges, Especially of Health
In 1983 my parents in the United States needed assistance. Doris, Gerri, and I had a family meeting.
Doris, who had served for 35 years as a missionary in Brazil, chose to return and look after them.
Why take two missionaries out of the field, she said, when one can do the job?
Since the death of our parents, Doris has stayed in Chattanooga and serves as a special pioneer.
I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1995 and had to return to the United States.
We settled in Goldsboro, North Carolina, because it was about halfway between my family in Tennessee and Gerri’s in Pennsylvania.
My cancer is now in remission, and we serve in a Goldsboro congregation as infirm special pioneers.
As I look back over 65 years in the full - time ministry, I am truly grateful that Jehovah has blessed Gerri and me for making adjustments to serve him.
How true are the words of David: “With someone loyal [Jehovah] will act in loyalty ”! ​ — 2 Sam.
22: 26.

Have you carefully read the recent issues of The Watchtower?
Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
Frenchman Pierre Robert was known by that name. During the Reformation in the 16th century, he translated the Bible into French.
He preferred “overseer ” to“ bishop ” and “congregation ” to“ church. ”
In places, he rendered God’s name “Jehovah. ” ​ — 9 / 1, pages 18 - 20.
Each of Israel’s other tribes got an allotment of land, but the Levites had Jehovah as their “share. ”
Still, Jehovah cared for their basic material needs.
Today, those who have the privilege of advancing Kingdom interests can be confident that the necessities of life will be provided. ​ — 9 / 15, pages 7 - 8, 13.
• How do we know when ancient Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians?
Classical historians give mixed, conflicting details about the Babylonian kings and their reigns. Yet, scholars agree that Cyrus II conquered Babylon in 539 B.C.E., a pivotal date.
In determining if a type of recreation will be beneficial and be pleasing in God’s eyes, it is useful to ask: What does it include?
When will I pursue it?
• How can the account at Proverbs 7: 6 - 23 help us avoid viewing pornography?
She seduced him. Today, we do well to avoid Internet sites that contain provocative images, and it is important to seek God’s help in prayer before even encountering such images on the Internet. ​ — 11 / 15, pages 9 - 10. • How do we know whether the earth will survive 2012?
Because of cycles in an ancient Maya calendar, some feel that the world will end in the year 2012.

Learn From God’s Word
This article considers questions you may have raised and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible.
Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.
Are Bible prophecies specific?
Only Almighty God can foresee the future in detail.
For example, since early times, he foretold the arrival of someone called the Messiah, or Christ.
The Messiah would be a descendant of the faithful man Abraham.
He would be a ruler who would make it possible for obedient humans to regain the blessing of perfect life free of disease.
This Promised One was to come from Bethlehem. ​ — Read Micah 5: 2.
Jesus proved to be the Messiah. Over seven centuries in advance, the Bible foretold that the Messiah would be born of a virgin and would be despised.
He would give his life for the sins of many, and he would be buried with the rich.
Every detail came true. ​ — Read Zechariah 9: 9; 11: 12.
Does God predict dates?
Over five centuries in advance, the Bible prophesied the exact year of the Messiah’s appearance.
The time until his arrival was measured in weeks of years, meaning that each “week ” was seven years long.
There would be 7 plus 62 of such weeks, making a total of 69 weeks of years.
That equals 483 years.
When did that span of years begin?
According to the Bible, the period began when God’s servant Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem and began to rebuild the city.
Persian history establishes the date as 455 B.C.E.
Jesus was baptized as the Messiah 483 years later, in the year 29 C.E., exactly on time. ​ — Read Daniel 9: 25.
Are Bible prophecies coming true now?
Jesus prophesied momentous events for our time.
His prophecy mentions the good news of God’s Kingdom, which will bring worldwide relief to people who love God.
The Kingdom will bring an end to the entire wicked system of things in which we live. ​ — Read Matthew 24: 14, 21, 22.
Bible prophecies describe in detail the concluding period of the present system of things.
The Bible revealed that in contrast with what might be expected in an age of progress, people would be ruining the earth.
Distress caused by wars, food shortages, earthquakes, and disease epidemics would increase.
Moral standards would collapse.
In these difficult times, Jesus ’ followers would preach the good news of God’s Kingdom in all nations. ​ — Read Matthew 24: 3, 7, 8; 2 Timothy 3: 1 - 5.
What will be mankind’s future?
Almighty God has good things in store for faithful mankind.
Jesus Christ, the Messiah, along with his chosen ones, will rule over the earth from heaven.
They make up the Kingdom government, which will rule for a thousand years.
The dead will be raised and will have the opportunity of being judged worthy of everlasting life.
Sickness and death will be no more. ​ — Read Revelation 5: 10; 20: 6, 12; 21: 4, 5.
For more information, see pages 23 - 25 and 197 - 201 of the book, What Does the Bible Really Teach?, pictured here.
Imitate Their Faith
ESTHER slowly approached the throne, her heart racing.
Imagine a hush falling over the great royal chamber in the Persian palace of Shushan, a silence so profound that Esther could hear her own soft footsteps and the rustling of her royal garments.
She could not let her attention wander to the grandeur of the royal court, the graceful columns, the richly carved ceiling of cedars imported from distant Lebanon.
She trained all her attention on the man seated upon the throne, the man who held her life in his hands.
The king watched her intently as she approached, extending his golden scepter toward her.
As she came to the throne, Esther reached out and gratefully touched the top of the scepter. ​ — Esther 5: 1, 2.
Everything about King Ahasuerus bespoke his immense wealth and power.
The royal garb of the Persian monarchs of those times reputedly cost the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars.
Yet, Esther could see some warmth in her husband’s eyes; in his own way, he did love her.
He said: “What do you have, O Esther the queen, and what is your request?
To the half of the kingship ​ — let it even be given to you! ” ​ — Esther 5: 3.
Esther had already shown remarkable faith and courage; she came before the king to protect her people from a plot to wipe them all out.
So far, she had met with success, but greater challenges lay ahead.
She had to convince this proud monarch that his most trusted adviser was a wicked man who had duped him into condemning Esther’s people to death.
How would she persuade him, and what can we learn from her faith?
She Wisely Chose “a Time to Speak ”
Should Esther have revealed to the king the whole problem in front of his court?
Doing so might have humiliated him and given his adviser Haman time to dispute her charges.
So what did Esther do?
Centuries earlier, wise King Solomon was inspired to write: “For everything there is an appointed time,... a time to keep quiet and a time to speak. ”
We may imagine Esther’s adoptive father, the faithful man Mordecai, teaching the young woman such principles as she grew up under his care.
Esther certainly understood the importance of choosing carefully the “time to speak. ”
Esther said: “If to the king it does seem good, let the king with Haman come today to the banquet that I have made for him. ”
The king agreed and had Haman summoned.
Can you see how wisely Esther spoke?
She preserved her husband’s dignity and created a more suitable setting for revealing her concerns to him.
No doubt Esther prepared that feast carefully, seeing to it that in every detail she catered to her husband’s preferences.
The banquet included fine wine to encourage a happy mood.
Ahasuerus enjoyed himself, and he was moved to ask Esther again what her petition might be.
Was this now the time to speak?
Esther thought not.
Rather, she invited the king and Haman to come to a second banquet, on the following day.
Why did she delay?
Remember, all of Esther’s people were facing death by the king’s decree.
With so much at stake, Esther had to be sure that the moment was right.
So she waited, creating yet another opportunity to show her husband how highly she regarded him.
Patience is a rare and precious quality.
Though distressed and eager to speak her mind, Esther patiently waited for the right moment.
We can learn much from her example, for all of us have likely seen wrongs that need to be put right.
If we seek to convince someone in authority to address a problem, we may need to imitate Esther and be patient.
Proverbs 25: 15 says: “By patience a commander is induced, and a mild tongue itself can break a bone. ”
If we wait patiently for the right moment and speak mildly, as Esther did, even opposition as hard as bone may be broken.
Did Esther’s God, Jehovah, bless her patience and wisdom?
Patience Paves the Way for Justice
Esther’s patience paved the way for a remarkable chain of events.
Haman left the first banquet in high spirits, “joyful and merry of heart ” that the king and queen favored him so.
As Haman passed through the castle gate, though, his eyes fell upon Mordecai, that Jew who still refused to pay him special homage.
Mordecai’s reasons had nothing to do with disrespect but, rather, with his conscience and his relationship with Jehovah God.
Yet, Haman “was immediately filled with rage. ” ​ — Esther 5: 9.
When Haman told his wife and friends of this slight, they urged him to prepare a huge stake, over 72 feet (22 m) tall, and then to ask the king’s permission to hang Mordecai on it.
Haman liked their idea and immediately set about the task. ​ — Esther 5: 12 - 14.
Meanwhile, the king had an unusual night.
“The king’s sleep fled, ” the Bible tells us, so he had the official records of State read aloud to him.
The reading included the report of an assassination plot against Ahasuerus.
He remembered the affair; his would - be murderers were caught and executed.
What, though, about the man who had exposed the plot ​ — Mordecai?
The answer? Nothing at all had been done for the man. ​ — Esther 6: 1 - 3.
Agitated, the king asked what court officials were available to help him correct this oversight.
Of all people, Haman was in the king’s court ​ — early, it seems, because he was eager to secure permission to execute Mordecai.
But before he could make his request, the king asked Haman how best to honor a man who had won the king’s favor.
Haman assumed that the king had him in mind.
So Haman devised a lavish honor: Clothe the man in royal garb, and have a high official parade him around Shushan on the king’s own horse, calling out the man’s praises for all to hear.
Imagine the expression on Haman’s face when he learned that the man to be honored was Mordecai!
And whom did the king assign to sing out Mordecai’s praises?
Haman! ​ — Esther 6: 4 - 10.
Haman grudgingly carried out what to him was an odious duty and then rushed home in distress.
His wife and friends said that this turn of events could only bode ill; he was bound to fail in his fight against Mordecai the Jew. ​ — Esther 6: 12, 13.
Because Esther was patient, waiting that one extra day to present her request to the king, Haman was given time to lay the basis for his own downfall.
And might not Jehovah God have been behind the king’s sleeplessness?
Little wonder that God’s Word encourages us to show a “waiting attitude. ”
When we wait on God, we may find that his solutions to our problems far exceed anything we might have devised ourselves.
She Spoke Up Bravely
Esther dared not test the king’s patience any further; at her second banquet, she had to tell all.
But how?
As it turned out, the king gave her the opportunity, asking again what her petition might be.
Esther’s “time to speak ” had come.
We may imagine Esther saying a silent prayer to her God before uttering these words: “If I have found favor in your eyes, O king, and if to the king it does seem good, let there be given me my own soul at my petition and my people at my request. ”
Notice that she assured the king that she respected his judgment regarding what seemed good.
How Esther differed from Vashti, the king’s previous wife, who had purposely humiliated her husband!
Further, Esther did not criticize the king’s folly of trusting in Haman.
Rather, she begged the king to protect her from a danger to her own life.
That request surely moved and amazed the king.
Who would dare endanger his queen?
Esther went on: “We have been sold, I and my people, to be annihilated, killed and destroyed.
Now if we had been sold for mere men slaves and for mere maidservants, I should have kept silent.
But the distress is not appropriate when with damage to the king. ”
Note that Esther frankly exposed the problem, yet she added that she would have kept quiet about it if mere slavery had been the threat.
Esther’s example teaches us much about the art of persuasion.
If you ever need to lay bare a serious problem to a loved one or even to a person in high authority, a mixture of patience, respect, and candor can be of great help. ​ — Proverbs 16: 21, 23.
Ahasuerus demanded: “Who is this, and just where is the one who has emboldened himself to do that way? ”
Imagine Esther pointing a finger as she said: “The man, the adversary and enemy, is this bad Haman. ”
The accusation hung in the air.
Terror filled Haman.
Picture the volatile monarch’s face coloring as he realized that his trusted adviser had duped him into signing an order that would destroy his own beloved wife!
The king stormed out into the garden to regain his composure. ​ — Esther 7: 5 - 7.
Haman, exposed as the scheming coward that he was, groveled at the queen’s feet.
When the king came back into the room and saw Haman pleading with Esther on her couch, he angrily accused Haman of attempting to rape the queen in the king’s own home.
That sounded the death knell for Haman.
He was taken away, his face covered.
One of the king’s officials then spoke up, telling the king of the huge stake that Haman had intended for Mordecai.
Ahasuerus immediately ordered that Haman himself be hanged upon it. ​ — Esther 7: 8 - 10.
In today’s unjust world, it is easy to imagine that we will never see justice done.
Have you ever felt that way?
Esther never despaired, never turned cynical, never lost faith.
When the time came, she spoke up bravely for what was right, and she trusted in Jehovah to do the rest.
Let us do the same!
Jehovah has not changed since Esther’s day.
He is still more than able to catch the wicked and cunning in their own traps, just as he did Haman. ​ — Psalm 7: 11 - 16.
She Acted Unselfishly for Jehovah and for His People
At last, the king learned who Mordecai was ​ — not only his loyal protector against assassination but also the adoptive father of Esther. Ahasuerus bestowed Haman’s position as prime minister on Mordecai.
Haman’s house ​ — including his immense fortune — ​ the king gave to Esther, who placed Mordecai over it. ​ — Esther 8: 1, 2.
Now that Esther and Mordecai were safe, could the queen relax?
At that moment, Haman’s decree to kill all the Jews was making its way to every corner of the empire.
Haman had cast lots, or Pur ​ — evidently a form of spiritism — ​ to determine the opportune time to carry out this vicious attack.
The day was yet months away, but it was fast approaching.
Could disaster still be averted?
Esther unselfishly risked her life again, appearing before the king once more without an official invitation.
This time, she wept for her people, pleading with her husband to revoke the terrible edict.
But laws passed in the Persian monarch’s name could not be revoked.
So the king empowered Esther and Mordecai to enact new laws.
A second proclamation was sent out, giving the Jews the right to defend themselves.
Riders sped to every part of the empire, taking the Jews this good news. Hope was kindled anew in many hearts.
We may imagine the Jews throughout that vast empire arming themselves and preparing for battle, which they could never have done without that new edict.
More important, though, would “Jehovah of armies ” be with his people? ​ — 1 Samuel 17: 45.
When the chosen day finally came, God’s people were ready.
Even many Persian officials were on their side now, as news had traveled far and wide about the new prime minister, Mordecai the Jew.
Jehovah gave his people a great victory. He no doubt saw to it that, lest his people face terrible reprisals, their enemies suffered a thorough defeat.
* ​ — Esther 9: 1 - 6.
Furthermore, Mordecai would never be safe to preside over Haman’s house while ten sons of that evil man still lived. They too were killed.
A Bible prophecy was thus fulfilled, for God had earlier foretold the complete destruction of the Amalekites, who had proved to be wicked enemies of his people.
The sons of Haman may well have been among the very last of that condemned nation.
Esther had to take on her young shoulders her share of very heavy burdens ​ — such as royal edicts involving war and execution.
It could not have been easy.
But Jehovah’s will required that his people be protected from destruction; the nation of Israel was to produce the promised Messiah, the one source of hope for all mankind!
Servants of God today are delighted to know that when the Messiah, Jesus, came to the earth, he forbade his followers from that time forward to take part in physical warfare. ​ — Matthew 26: 52.
Nonetheless, Christians do engage in a spiritual warfare; Satan is ever more eager to destroy our faith in Jehovah God. What a blessing to have Esther as an example!
Like her, may we show faith by our wise and patient use of persuasion, by our courage, and by our unselfish willingness to stand up for God’s people.
In the previous article in this series, we saw how the orphan Esther was adopted by her much older cousin, Mordecai, and was later chosen to be the wife of Ahasuerus, the king of Persia.
The king’s adviser, Haman, hatched a wicked plot to exterminate Mordecai’s people, the Jews.
Mordecai convinced Esther to approach the king to plead in behalf of her people. ​ — See the article “Imitate Their Faith — ​ She Stood Up for God’s People, ” in the October 1, 2011, issue of The Watchtower.
The king allowed the Jews a second day to finish their conquest of their enemies.
To this day, the Jews commemorate that victory each year in the month of Adar, which corresponds to late February and early March.
The festival is called Purim, named after the lots that Haman cast in his quest to destroy Israel.

Questions About Esther
Why did Mordecai allow Esther to marry a pagan unbeliever?
There is no basis for the suggestion of some scholars that Mordecai was an opportunist who wanted Esther to wed the king for the sake of prestige.
A faithful Jew, he would not have favored such a marriage.
Ancient Jewish tradition holds that Mordecai tried to prevent the marriage.
It seems unlikely that either he or Esther, mere foreigners in a land ruled by an autocrat who held a godlike status, would have had much choice in the matter.
In time, it became clear that Jehovah used Esther’s marriage as a means of protecting his people. ​ — Esther 4: 14.
Why does the book of Esther contain no mention of God’s personal name, Jehovah?
Mordecai was evidently the inspired writer of the book.
Perhaps the book was at first kept with official Persian records before it was taken back to Jerusalem.
The use of Jehovah’s name might have moved worshippers of the Persian gods to destroy the book.
In any case, Jehovah’s involvement in the story is clear.
Interestingly, God’s personal name is concealed in the original Hebrew text by means of acrostics, wherein the phrasing appears to have been arranged deliberately so that the first or the last letters of successive words spell out God’s name. ​ — Esther 1: 20, footnote.
Is the book of Esther historically inaccurate?
Critics level that charge against the book.
However, some scholars have noted that the writer of the book showed a remarkably detailed knowledge of Persian royalty, architecture, and customs.
True, no mention of Queen Esther has been found in surviving secular documents, but Esther would hardly be the only royal personage who was erased from public records.
What is more, secular records do show that a man named Mardukâ, a Persian equivalent of Mordecai, served as a court official in Shushan at the time described in the book.
[Box on page 29]
A Prophecy Fulfilled
In fighting for God’s people, Esther and Mordecai fulfilled another Bible prophecy.
Over a dozen centuries earlier, Jehovah inspired the patriarch Jacob to foretell regarding one of his sons: “Benjamin will keep on tearing like a wolf. In the morning he will eat the animal seized and at evening he will divide spoil. ”
In the “morning ” of Israel’s kingly history, Benjamin’s descendants included King Saul and other mighty warriors for Jehovah’s people.
In the “evening ” of that royal history, after the sun had set on Israel’s kingly line, Esther and Mordecai, both of the tribe of Benjamin, warred effectively against Jehovah’s enemies.
In a sense, they also divided spoil, in that Haman’s vast estate went to them.

Yes, This Is the Study Edition!
We have redesigned the study edition to be more appealing and helpful to you in your study of Jehovah’s precious Word of truth. ​ — Ps.
1: 2; 119: 97.
It was four years ago that we began publishing two editions of The Watchtower, one for the public and one for all of us ​ — Jehovah’s Witnesses and our progressive Bible students.
Regarding the study edition, a longtime servant of Jehovah wrote: “Marvelous and penetrating ​ — that was my impression of the first study edition of The Watchtower.
The deeper spiritual language and statements spoke directly to my heart.
Thank you so much for this wonderful new provision. ”
Another brother wrote: “I look forward to spending intimate hours with the study edition and my Reference Bible at hand. ”
We trust that you feel similarly.
As you know, The Watchtower has been in publication since 1879, a feat that has been possible only with Jehovah’s spirit and blessing.
During these 133 years, there have been several changes to the cover of the magazine.
For 2012, each study edition will feature on the cover an artist’s colorful rendering of a witnessing scene, reminding us of our God - given commission to bear thorough witness about Jehovah’s Kingdom.
Inside the cover, on page 2, you will find the photograph on which the artwork is based, along with a brief description of what is taking place and where.
Through the course of the year, this will remind all of us that Jehovah’s people are preaching the good news “in all the inhabited earth. ” ​ — Matt.
24: 14.
What other changes have been made to the magazine?
The review box has been moved to the beginning of each study article.
This will highlight for you the main points that you should look for as you read and study the article.
Of course, Watchtower Study conductors will want to continue using these questions to review the material at the end of the study.
You will note that the margins have been widened a little and that the page and paragraph numbers stand out more.
As is explained in this month’s issue, a new feature, “From Our Archives, ” is being added to show significant developments in the modern - day history of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Also, true - life experiences will occasionally appear under the heading “They Offered Themselves Willingly. ”
These will vividly describe the joy, satisfaction, and happiness that brothers and sisters have experienced by serving where there is a greater need for Kingdom proclaimers.
May you thoroughly enjoy the time you spend studying God’s Word with the help of this magazine.

“Your word is truth. ” ​ — JOHN 17: 17.
How did a meeting that was held in Jerusalem in 49 C.E. contrast with subsequent church councils?
Who were some champions of God’s Word who lived during the Middle Ages?
What method for Bible study was used by faithful Christians in the late 1800 ’ s, and why was it effective?
From personal experience, name one important respect in which Jehovah’s Witnesses are different from other religious groups.
THINK about the first time you had a meaningful discussion with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
What do you remember about it?
Many would reply, ‘ I was impressed by the fact that the Witness used the Bible to answer all my questions. ’
How delighted we were to discover God’s purpose for the earth, what happens when we die, and what the future holds for our dead loved ones!
What are some of the reasons why you came to appreciate the Bible?
As we studied further, however, we realized that the Bible does much more than answer our questions about life, death, and the future.
Its counsel is timeless, and those who carefully follow it will lead successful and happy lives. (Read Psalm 1: 1 - 3.)
Genuine Christians have always accepted the Bible, “not as the word of men, but, just as it truthfully is, as the word of God. ”
A brief historical review will highlight the contrast between those who truly respect God’s Word and those who do not.
A THORNY ISSUE IS SETTLED
What issue threatened the unity of the first - century Christian congregation, and what was at stake?
During the 13 years that followed the anointing of the first uncircumcised Gentile, Cornelius, an issue arose that threatened the unity of the Christian congregation.
Growing numbers of Gentiles were embracing the Christian faith.
The question was, Should the men be circumcised according to the Jewish custom before presenting themselves for baptism?
That was not an easy question for a Jew to answer.
Jews who observed the Law would not even enter a Gentile’s home, let alone enjoy warm fellowship with one.
Jewish Christians were already severely persecuted for abandoning their former religion.
If they went so far as to welcome uncircumcised Gentiles into their midst, it would only widen the rift between practicing Jews and the Christians and expose the latter to further reproach. ​ — Gal. 2: 11 - 14.
Who were called upon to resolve the issue, and in this regard, what questions could have arisen in the minds of onlookers?
In 49 C.E., the apostles and older men in Jerusalem, themselves circumcised Jews, “gathered together to see about this affair. ”
What followed was, not a mind - numbing theological debate over dry technicalities, but a lively doctrinal discussion.
Strong opinions were expressed on both sides of the issue.
Would personal preferences or prejudices rule the day?
Would the responsible older men postpone the decision until the religious climate in Israel improved for them?
Or would some sort of compromise be worked out, with advocates on each side modifying their position until a consensus of sorts was reached?
In what important ways did the meeting in Jerusalem in 49 C.E. differ from church councils held in later centuries?
Compromise and lobbying are common at church councils today. However, at that meeting in Jerusalem, there was no compromise; nor did any lobbying for votes take place.
What is more, a unanimous decision was reached.
As strongly as each participant felt about his point of view, all present respected God’s Word, and those holy writings held the key to resolving the issue. ​ — Read Psalm 119: 97 - 101.
6, 7.
How were the Scriptures used to settle the circumcision issue?
The passage that helped settle the matter was Amos 9: 11, 12.
As quoted at Acts 15: 16, 17, it reads: “I shall return and rebuild the booth of David that is fallen down; and I shall rebuild its ruins and erect it again, in order that those who remain of the men may earnestly seek Jehovah, together with people of all the nations, people who are called by my name, says Jehovah. ”
‘ But wait, ’ someone may object, ‘ that text does not say that it was unnecessary for Gentile believers to be circumcised. ’
That is true; however, Jewish Christians would have got the point.
They did not consider circumcised Gentiles as ‘ people of the nations ’ but as brothers.
For example, according to Bagster’s version of the Septuagint, Esther 8: 17 reads: “Many of the Gentiles were circumcised, and became Jews. ”
Thus, when the Scriptures foretold that those remaining of the house of Israel (Jews and circumcised Jewish proselytes) together with “people of all the nations ” (uncircumcised Gentiles) would become one people for God’s name, the message was clear.
Circumcision was not required of Gentiles who wanted to become Christians.
What role did courage play in the decision that was made?
God’s Word and his spirit led those sincere Christians to “a unanimous accord. ”
Even though the decision would likely expose Jewish Christians to more persecution, faithful ones lent their full support to the Bible - based decision. ​ — Acts 16: 4, 5.
A MARKED CONTRAST
What is one important factor that led to the defilement of true worship, and what significant doctrine came to the fore?
The apostle Paul foretold that after the death of the apostles, the Christian faith would be contaminated by false teachings. (Read 2 Thessalonians 2: 3, 7.)
Among those who would not put up with “the healthful teaching ” were some in responsible positions.
Paul warned elders in his day: “From among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves. ”
The New Encyclopædia Britannica describes one major factor that led to twisted reasoning: “Christians who had some training in Greek philosophy began to feel the need to express their faith in its terms, both for their own intellectual satisfaction and in order to convert educated pagans. ”
An important doctrine that was given a pagan twist had to do with the identity of Jesus Christ.
The Bible calls him the Son of God; the lovers of Greek philosophy insisted that he is God.
How could the issue of Christ’s identity have been settled?
The question was debated at a number of church councils.
The issue could have been settled quite easily had the delegates given appropriate weight to the Scriptures, but most did not.
In fact, the majority had made up their minds even before they arrived at the councils, and they left more deeply entrenched than ever in their positions.
The canons and declarations that resulted from these meetings hardly even referred to the Scriptures.
What weight was given to the authority of the so - called Church Fathers, and why so?
Why were the Scriptures not more thoroughly considered?
Scholar Charles Freeman answers that those who believed that Jesus is God “found it difficult to refute the many sayings of Jesus that suggested he was subordinate to God the Father. ”
As a result, church tradition and opinions of later authorities were substituted for the Gospels.
To this day, many of the clergy elevate the uninspired sayings of so - called Church Fathers to a plane higher than the Word of God!
If you have ever discussed the Trinity doctrine with a seminarian, you have likely noticed that.
What negative influence was exercised by the emperor?
A notable feature of the debates at those councils was the interference of the Roman emperors.
In this regard, Professor Richard E.
Rubenstein wrote respecting the Council of Nicaea: “Constantine had favored and enriched [the bishops] beyond their wildest dreams.
In less than a year, the new emperor had returned or rebuilt virtually all their churches, given them back the jobs and honors taken from them...
He had accorded Christian clergymen privileges formerly granted to pagan priests. ”
As a result, “Constantine was in a position strongly to influence ​ — perhaps even to dictate — ​ the course of events at Nicaea. ”
Charles Freeman confirmed: “The precedent had now been set that the emperor might intervene not only to strengthen the Church but to influence doctrine. ” ​ — Read James 4: 4.
What factors, do you think, influenced church leaders of later centuries to ignore the Bible’s plain teachings?
While church dignitaries found it difficult to determine the exact identity of Jesus Christ, many of the common people had no such problem.
Since they were not interested in lining their purses with the emperor’s gold or in furthering their careers in the church hierarchy, they were able to view matters more objectively, in the light of the Scriptures. And by all accounts, they did.
A theologian of the period, Gregory of Nyssa, made this derisive comment regarding the common people: “Clothes dealers, money changers, and grocers are all theologians.
If you inquire about the value of your money, some philosopher explains wherein the Son differs from the Father.
If you ask the price of bread, your answer is the Father is greater than the Son. If you should want to know whether the bath is ready, you get the pronouncement that the Son was created out of nothing. ”
Yes, unlike the members of the hierarchy, many of the common people were supporting their conclusions by using God’s Word.
Gregory and his associates would have done well to listen to them!
“WHEAT ” AND“ WEEDS ” GROW TOGETHER
Why can we conclude that from the first century onward, there must always have been some genuine anointed Christians on earth?
In a parable, Jesus indicated that from the first century onward, there would always be some genuine anointed Christians on the earth.
He compared them to “wheat ” growing among“ weeds. ”
Of course, we cannot say for certain which individuals or groups belonged to the anointed wheat class, but we can confirm that there have always been some who have courageously defended God’s Word and exposed the church’s unscriptural teachings.
Let us consider a few examples.
15, 16.
Name some who showed respect for God’s Word.
Archbishop Agobard of Lyons, France (779 - 840 C.E.), spoke out against image worship, churches dedicated to saints, and the church’s unscriptural liturgies and practices.
One of his contemporaries, Bishop Claudius, also rejected church tradition and objected to prayers to saints and the veneration of relics.
In the 11th century, Archdeacon Berengarius of Tours, France, was excommunicated for rejecting the Catholic teaching of transubstantiation.
Moreover, he held that the Bible is superior to church tradition.
The 12th century saw the arrival of two lovers of Bible truth, Peter of Bruys and Henry of Lausanne.
Peter resigned from the priesthood because he could not reconcile with the Scriptures the Catholic teachings of infant baptism, transubstantiation, prayers for the dead, and worship of the cross.
In 1140, Peter paid for his beliefs with his life.
Henry, a monk, spoke out against corrupt practices in the church as well as the unscriptural aspects of church liturgy. He was arrested in 1148 and spent the rest of his life in prison.
What important steps were taken by Waldo and his followers?
About the time that Peter of Bruys was burned alive for daring to criticize the church, a person was born who would later have a powerful influence on the spread of Bible truth.
His last name was Valdès, or Waldo.
* Unlike Peter of Bruys and Henry of Lausanne, he was a layman, but he valued God’s Word so much that he divested himself of his material goods and arranged for portions of the Bible to be translated into a language commonly spoken in southeastern France.
Some were so thrilled to hear the Bible’s message in their own tongue that they too gave up their belongings and devoted their lives to sharing Bible truth with others.
The church found this deeply disturbing.
In 1184 these zealous men and women, later called the Waldenses, were excommunicated by the pope and banished from their homes by the bishop.
This action actually served to spread the Bible’s message to other areas.
Eventually, the followers of Waldo, Peter of Bruys, and Henry of Lausanne as well as other dissenters could be found in many parts of Europe.
Other champions of Bible truth rose up in the centuries that followed: John Wycliffe (c.
1330 - 1384), William Tyndale (c.
1494 - 1536), Henry Grew (1781 - 1862), and George Storrs (1796 - 1879).
“THE WORD OF GOD IS NOT BOUND ”
“The word of God is not bound, ” says 2 Timothy 2: 9.
In 1870 a group of sincere Bible students began searching for the truth.
Their method of study?
Someone would raise a question. They would discuss it.
They would look up all related scriptures on the point, and then, when they were satisfied with the harmony of these texts, they would finally state their conclusion and make a record of it.
Does it not reassure you to know that like the apostles and older men of the first century, those faithful men, our “spiritual ancestors ” of the late 1800 ’ s, were determined to align their beliefs solidly with God’s Word?
What is the yeartext for 2012, and why is it appropriate?
The Bible is still the foundation for our beliefs.
With that in mind, the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses has chosen as our yeartext for 2012 the confident statement of Jesus: “Your word is truth. ”
Since everyone who desires to gain God’s approval must walk in the truth, may all of us continually strive to be guided by God’s Word.
Valdès has sometimes been called Pierre Valdès or Peter Waldo, but his first name cannot be confirmed.

“Keep on the watch with me. ” ​ — MATT.
Watching for direction on where to preach?
Being vigilant with a view to prayers? Bearing thorough witness despite obstacles?
1 - 3.
How did the apostles fail to keep on the watch during Jesus ’ final night on earth, and what shows that they learned from their mistake?
IMAGINE the scene on the final night of Jesus ’ earthly life.
Jesus has come to one of his favorite places, the garden of Gethsemane, just east of Jerusalem.
He has come here with his faithful apostles. With much weighing on his mind and heart, Jesus needs to find solitude so that he can pray. ​ — Matt.
26: 36; John 18: 1, 2. Three of the apostles ​ — Peter, James, and John — ​ accompany Jesus to a spot deeper in the garden.
“Stay here and keep on the watch with me, ” he tells them, and then he goes off to pray.
When he comes back, he finds his friends fast asleep.
Again he implores them: “Keep on the watch. ” Yet, they fall asleep two more times!
Later that same night, all the apostles fail to keep spiritually alert.
Why, they even abandon Jesus and flee! ​ — Matt. 26: 38, 41, 56.
Surely the apostles regretted their failure to keep on the watch.
Those faithful men quickly learned from their mistake.
The Bible book of Acts shows that they went on to set an outstanding example in keeping watchful.
Their faithful course must have influenced their fellow Christians to do the same.
Now more than ever, we need to keep on the watch.
Let us discuss three lessons about keeping on the watch that we can learn from the book of Acts.
WATCHFUL FOR DIRECTION ON WHERE TO PREACH
4, 5.
How did Paul and his traveling companions experience the direction of the holy spirit?
To begin with, the apostles were watchful for direction on where to preach.
In one account, we learn how Jesus used the holy spirit, which Jehovah put at his disposal, to guide the apostle Paul and his traveling companions during a most unusual journey.
Let us join them. ​ — Read Acts 16: 6 - 10.
Paul, Silas, and Timothy had left the city of Lystra in southern Galatia.
Days later they reached a Roman highway leading westward to the most populated region of the district of Asia.
They wanted to take that road so as to visit cities where thousands of people needed to hear about Christ.
But something stopped them in their tracks. Verse 6 says: “They went through Phrygia and the country of Galatia, because they were forbidden by the holy spirit to speak the word in the district of Asia. ”
In some undisclosed manner, the holy spirit prevented the travelers from preaching in the province of Asia.
Evidently Jesus ​ — by means of God’s spirit — ​ wanted to guide Paul and his companions in a different direction.
6, 7. (a) What happened to Paul and the other travelers near Bithynia?
(b) What decision did the disciples make, and with what result?
Where did the eager travelers go?
Verse 7 explains: “Further, when getting down to Mysia they made efforts to go into Bithynia, but the spirit of Jesus did not permit them. ”
Prevented from preaching in Asia, Paul and his companions turned northward, intending to preach in the cities of Bithynia.
However, when they neared Bithynia, Jesus again used the holy spirit to block them.
By then, the men must have been puzzled.
They knew what to preach and how to preach, but they did not know where to preach.
We might put it this way: They had knocked on the door leading to Asia ​ — but in vain.
They had knocked on the door leading to Bithynia ​ — again in vain. Did they stop knocking?
At this point, the men made a decision that might have appeared a bit strange.
Verse 8 tells us: “They passed Mysia by and came down to Troas. ”
So the travelers turned west and walked 350 miles (563 km), bypassing city after city until they reached the port of Troas, the natural gateway to Macedonia.
There, for the third time, Paul and his companions knocked on a door, but this time it swung wide open! Verse 9 reports what happened next: “During the night a vision appeared to Paul: a certain Macedonian man was standing and entreating him and saying: ‘ Step over into Macedonia and help us. ’ ”
Finally, Paul knew where to preach.
Without delay, the men sailed for Macedonia.
8, 9.
What can we learn from the account of Paul’s journey?
What can we learn from this account?
Note that only after Paul set out for Asia did God’s spirit intervene.
Then, only after Paul neared Bithynia did Jesus step in.
And finally, only after Paul reached Troas did Jesus direct him to Macedonia.
As Head of the congregation, Jesus may deal with us in a similar way.
For example, you may have been thinking about serving as a pioneer or moving to an area where the need is greater.
But it may be only after you take steps to reach your goal that Jesus, by means of God’s spirit, will guide you.
To illustrate: A driver can direct his car to turn left or right but only if the car is moving.
Likewise, Jesus may direct us in expanding our ministry but only if we are moving ​ — if we are putting forth effort to reach our goal.
What, though, if your efforts do not bear fruit right away?
Should you give up, concluding that God’s spirit is not guiding you?
Well, remember that Paul too encountered setbacks.
Yet, he kept on searching and knocking until he found a door that opened.
Similarly, if you persevere in searching for “a large door that leads to activity, ” you too may be rewarded. ​ — 1 Cor.
16: 9. VIGILANT WITH A VIEW TO PRAYERS
What shows that being vigilant in prayer is essential to keeping on the watch?
Consider, now, a second lesson about watchfulness that we can learn from our first - century Christian brothers: They were vigilant with a view to prayers.
Persevering in prayer is essential to keeping on the watch.
Recall that in the garden of Gethsemane just before his arrest, Jesus told three of his apostles: “Keep on the watch and pray continually. ” ​ — Matt. 26: 41.
11, 12.
Why and how did Herod mistreat the Christians, including Peter?
Peter, who was present on that occasion, later experienced firsthand the power of fervent prayers. (Read Acts 12: 1 - 6.)
In the opening verses of this account, we learn that in order to win favor with the Jews, Herod mistreated the Christians.
He likely knew that James was an apostle who had been especially close to Jesus.
Hence, Herod had James killed “by the sword. ” The congregation thus lost a beloved apostle.
What a test for the brothers! What did Herod do next?
Verse 3 explains: “As he saw it was pleasing to the Jews, he went on to arrest Peter also. ”
But prisons had not always managed to contain the apostles, including Peter.
Herod may well have known that.
The canny politician took no chances.
He turned Peter over to “four shifts of four soldiers each to guard him, as he intended to produce him for the people after the passover. ”
Imagine that! Herod had Peter chained between 2 guards, with 16 guards working in shifts day and night to make sure that this apostle did not escape.
Herod’s intention was to present Peter to the people after the Passover, his death sentence a gift to delight the crowds.
Under such dire circumstances, what could Peter’s fellow Christians do?
13, 14. (a) How did the congregation react to Peter’s imprisonment?
(b) What can we learn from the example set by Peter’s fellow Christians in the matter of prayer?
Verse 5 reads: “Consequently Peter was being kept in the prison; but prayer to God for him was being carried on intensely by the congregation. ”
Yes, their prayers in behalf of their beloved brother were intense, heartfelt pleas.
So the death of James had not plunged them into despair; nor had it caused them to view prayer as ineffective.
On the contrary, they knew that the prayers of faithful worshippers mean a great deal to Jehovah.
If such prayers are in harmony with his will, he answers them. ​ — Heb. 13: 18, 19; Jas.
What can we learn from the response of Peter’s fellow Christians?
Keeping on the watch involves praying not just for ourselves but for our brothers and sisters as well.
Do you know of fellow believers who are beset by trials?
Some may be enduring persecution, governmental bans, or natural disasters.
Why not make them the subject of your heartfelt prayers?
You may know of others who are undergoing less noticeable hardships.
They may be struggling to cope with family troubles, discouragement, or ill health.
Why not think of specific individuals whom you can mention by name as you speak to Jehovah, the “Hearer of prayer ”? ​ — Ps.
65: 2.
15, 16. (a) Describe how Jehovah’s angel delivered Peter from prison.
(See the picture below.) (b) Why is it comforting to contemplate the way that Jehovah rescued Peter?
How, though, did things turn out for Peter?
During his final night in the prison while he was fast asleep between his two guards, Peter experienced a series of amazing events. (Read Acts 12: 7 - 11.)
Picture what happened: Suddenly, a bright light filled his cell. An angel stood there, evidently unseen by the guards, and urgently woke Peter up.
And those chains binding his hands simply fell off!
The angel then led Peter out of the cell, right by the guards stationed outside, and through the massive iron gate, which opened “of its own accord. ”
Once they were outside the prison, the angel vanished.
Peter was free!
Is it not faith - strengthening to contemplate Jehovah’s power to rescue his servants?
Of course, we do not expect Jehovah to deliver us miraculously at this time.
However, we have full faith that he uses his power in behalf of his people today.
By means of his powerful holy spirit, he can make us equal to any trial we may face.
And Jehovah will soon empower his Son to free countless millions from that most unyielding of prisons, death.
Our faith in God’s promises can give us tremendous courage when we face trials today.
BEARING THOROUGH WITNESS DESPITE OBSTACLES
How did Paul set an outstanding example in preaching with zeal and urgency?
Here is a third lesson about watchfulness that we can learn from the apostles: They kept on bearing thorough witness despite obstacles.
Preaching with zeal and urgency is vital to keeping on the watch.
The apostle Paul was an outstanding example in this regard. He exerted himself zealously, traveling extensively and establishing many congregations.
He endured many hardships, yet he never lost his zeal or his sense of urgency. ​ — 2 Cor. 11: 23 - 29.
How did Paul continue to bear witness when he was in custody in Rome?
Consider our last glimpse of Paul in the book of Acts, as recorded in Acts chapter 28.
Paul arrived in Rome, where he was to appear before Nero. He was kept in custody, perhaps chained to his guard.
Paul continued to find ways to bear witness.
(Read Acts 28: 17, 23, 24.)
After three days, Paul summoned the principal men of the Jews in order to give them a witness. Then, on a chosen day, he gave an even greater witness.
Verse 23 states: “They [the local Jews] now arranged for a day with him, and they came in greater numbers to him in his lodging place.
And he explained the matter to them by bearing thorough witness concerning the kingdom of God and by using persuasion with them concerning Jesus from both the law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning till evening. ”
19, 20. (a) Why was Paul effective in bearing witness?
(b) How did Paul respond when not everyone accepted the good news?
Why was Paul so effective in bearing witness?
Notice that verse 23 really highlights a number of reasons.
(1) He focused on God’s Kingdom and on Jesus Christ.
(2) He tried to appeal to his listeners “by using persuasion. ”
(3) He reasoned from the Scriptures.
(4) He showed a selfless attitude, bearing witness “from morning till evening. ”
Paul gave a powerful witness, but not everyone responded. “Some began to believe the things said; others would not believe, ” notes verse 24.
Dissension ensued, and the people departed.
Was Paul disheartened because not everyone accepted the good news?
Acts 28: 30, 31 tells us: “He remained for an entire two years in his own hired house, and he would kindly receive all those who came in to him, preaching the kingdom of God to them and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with the greatest freeness of speech, without hindrance. ”
On that truly warm note, the inspired book of Acts concludes.
What can we learn from Paul’s example when he was under house arrest?
What can we learn from Paul’s example?
While under house arrest, Paul was not free to witness from house to house.
Yet, he maintained a positive outlook, witnessing to all who came to him.
Likewise, many of God’s people today maintain their joy and keep preaching despite being unjustly imprisoned because of their faith.
Some of our dear brothers and sisters are housebound, perhaps even living in nursing homes because of advanced age or illness.
As they are able, they preach to doctors and staff, visitors, and others who come in to them.
Their heart’s desire is to bear thorough witness about God’s Kingdom.
How we appreciate the example they set!
(a) What provision is helping us to benefit from the Bible book of Acts?
(See box above.) (b) What is your determination as you await the end of this old system of things?
Clearly, there is much to learn about watchfulness from the apostles and other first - century Christians mentioned in the Bible book of Acts.
As we await the end of this old system of things, let us be determined to imitate those first - century Christians in giving a bold and zealous witness.
There is now no greater privilege we can have than to share in “bearing thorough witness ” about God’s Kingdom! ​ — Acts 28: 23.
[Box on page 13]
“THE BOOK OF ACTS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME FOR ME ”
After reading the book “Bearing Thorough Witness ” About God’s Kingdom, a traveling overseer expressed his feelings as follows:“ The book of Acts will never be the same for me.
I have ‘ walked ’ through the account of Acts on many occasions but only as if holding a candle and wearing dirty glasses.
Now I feel as if I have been blessed to see its glory in the brightness of the sun. ”

“[You have] the framework of the knowledge and of the truth in the Law. ” ​ — ROM. 2: 20.
What did the sacrifices stipulated by the Mosaic Law foreshadow?
What parallel exists between certain sacrifices made by the Israelites and by Christians today?
What factors determine whether a sacrifice will be acceptable or unacceptable to Jehovah?
Why should we be interested in understanding the significance of the Mosaic Law?
WERE it not for the inspired writings of the apostle Paul, it would be hard for us to understand the significance of many aspects of the Mosaic Law.
In his letter to the Hebrews, for example, he clarifies how Jesus as a “faithful high priest ” could once and for all time offer a“ propitiatory sacrifice ” making it possible for those exercising faith in it to obtain “an everlasting deliverance. ”
Paul explained that the tabernacle was merely “a shadow of the heavenly things ” and that Jesus became the Mediator of“ a better covenant ” than that mediated by Moses.
In Paul’s day, such explanations of the Law were invaluable to Christians, and they still are.
They help us to grasp more fully the value of the provisions that God has made for us.
What advantage did Jewish Christians have over Gentiles?
When Paul wrote to Christians in Rome, he directed some of his comments to congregation members who were of Jewish stock and who had been instructed in the Mosaic Law.
He acknowledged that because of their familiarity with that divine Law, such ones had the advantage of possessing a “framework of the knowledge and of the truth ” concerning Jehovah and his righteous principles.
A grasp of that ‘ framework of truth ’ and heartfelt respect for it enabled Jewish Christians, like faithful Jews before them, to guide, teach, and illuminate those who were in ignorance of the Law that Jehovah had given to his people. ​ — Read Romans 2: 17 - 20.
SHADOWS OF JESUS ’ SACRIFICE
How do we benefit from studying ancient Jewish sacrifices?
The framework of truth to which Paul referred is still important in order for us to understand Jehovah’s purposes.
The principles behind the Mosaic Law have not lost any significance or value.
With this in mind, let us consider just one aspect of that Law ​ — how various sacrifices and offerings led humble Jews to Christ and helped them to understand what God required of them.
And since Jehovah’s basic requirements for his servants never change, we will also see that God’s laws to the Israelites regarding sacrifices and offerings can help us to analyze the quality of our sacred service. ​ — Mal.
3: 6.
4, 5. (a) Of what did the Mosaic Law remind God’s people?
(b) God’s law concerning sacrifices pointed to what?
It could hardly have been lost on the ancient Jews that many aspects of the Mosaic Law emphasized their sinfulness.
For example, anyone who touched a human corpse was required to undergo purification.
To this end, a sound red cow was slaughtered and burned.
Its ashes were kept to make “water for cleansing, ” which was sprinkled on the person being purified on the third and the seventh day after contamination.
And as a reminder that human reproduction transmitted imperfection and sin, a woman who gave birth was required to observe a period of uncleanness, after which she was to make atonement by means of a sacrifice. ​ — Lev.
12: 1 - 8.
Animal sacrifices were required in many other situations of everyday life to atone for sins.
Whether the worshipper realized it or not, these sacrifices ​ — and those later offered at Jehovah’s temple — ​ were “a shadow ” of Jesus ’ perfect sacrifice. ​ — Heb.
10: 1 - 10. THE SPIRIT BEHIND THE SACRIFICE
6, 7. (a) What considerations guided the Israelites in their selection of sacrificial offerings, and what did this foreshadow?
(b) What questions might we ask ourselves?
A fundamental standard concerning any animal that was to be sacrificed to Jehovah was that it be “sound ” in all respects ​ — not blind, injured, deformed, or sick.
A second - rate offering was not acceptable to Jehovah.
The important requirement regarding animal sacrifices pictured that Jesus ’ sacrifice would be spotless and unblemished and that Jehovah would sacrifice what was best and dearest to him in order to redeem mankind. ​ — 1 Pet.
1: 18, 19.
If the person making a sacrifice was truly grateful to Jehovah for all of His goodness, then would he not be happy to select the very best that he possessed?
The quality of the offering was left up to the individual.
However, he knew that God would not be pleased with a defective offering because that would indicate that the man considered the sacrifice a mere formality, even a burden.
(Read Malachi 1: 6 - 8, 13.)
This should make us reflect on our service to God: ‘ With what spirit am I serving Jehovah?
Might it be appropriate for me to review the quality of my service and my motives for serving him? ’
8, 9.
Why should we consider the spirit with which the Israelites made their sacrifices?
If an Israelite’s sacrifice was a voluntary manifestation of sincere gratitude to Jehovah or, as in the case of a burnt offering, a request for his approval, then making the appropriate choice of animal would likely present no challenge.
The worshipper would be happy to give Jehovah his very best.
Christians today do not make the literal sacrifices stipulated by the Mosaic Law; yet they do make sacrifices, in the sense that they use their time, energy, and resources to serve Jehovah.
The apostle Paul referred to the “public declaration ” of the Christian hope and“ the doing of good and the sharing of things with others ” as sacrifices that please God.
The spirit with which Jehovah’s people engage in such activities reveals how grateful and appreciative they are for all that God has given to them.
So there is a parallel between the attitudes and motivations of those who engage in Christian service today and those who offered voluntary sacrifices in ancient times.
What can be said, though, of a situation in which the Mosaic Law required a sin offering or a guilt offering from an individual because of some shortcoming on his part?
Do you think that the obligatory nature of the sacrifice would have made a difference to a person’s willingness and attitude in offering it?
Might such sacrifices have been offered begrudgingly?
They would not have been if the person involved was sincere in wanting to maintain a good relationship with Jehovah.
What “sacrifices ” might Christians have to make to repair damaged relationships?
Similarly today, you may realize that thoughtlessly, unwittingly, or carelessly, you may have offended a brother.
Your conscience may tell you that you have fallen short in your conduct.
Anyone who is serious about serving Jehovah would do all in his power to rectify the shortcoming, would he not?
That could mean apologizing sincerely to the person offended or, in the case of serious wrongdoing, seeking the spiritual assistance of loving Christian overseers.
So it costs us something to rectify a sin committed against a fellow man or against God himself.
Even so, when we make such “sacrifices, ” we restore our relationship with Jehovah and our brother and we gain a clean conscience.
This, in turn, reassures us that Jehovah’s way is the best way.
11, 12. (a) What provision characterized communion sacrifices?
(b) What relevance do communion sacrifices have to modern - day pure worship?
Certain sacrifices stipulated by the Mosaic Law were considered communion offerings.
These signified peace with Jehovah.
The person making such an offering and his family would eat the meat of the sacrificed animal, perhaps in one of the temple’s dining rooms.
The officiating priest received a portion of the meat, as did the other priests serving at the temple.
The worshipper made his sacrifice purely out of the desire to enjoy a good relationship with God.
It was as though the worshipper, his family, the priests, and Jehovah himself were joyfully partaking of a meal together, in peace.
What greater privilege could there be than, in a symbolic way, to invite Jehovah to such a meal and for him to accept?
Naturally, the host would want to offer his very best to such an honored guest.
The provision of communion sacrifices, part of the Law’s framework of truth, pointed to the fact that by means of Jesus ’ greater sacrifice, all those of mankind who desire to attain an intimate, peaceful relationship with their Creator can do so.
Today, we can enjoy Jehovah’s friendship and company as we voluntarily sacrifice our resources and energies in his service.
CAUTIONS REGARDING SACRIFICES
13, 14.
Why was King Saul’s intended sacrifice not acceptable to Jehovah?
Naturally, in order to be accepted by Jehovah, the sacrifices prescribed by the Mosaic Law had to be offered with the right spirit and heart condition.
The Bible, however, contains cautionary examples of sacrifices that were not acceptable to God.
What made him reject them? Let us consider two situations.
The prophet Samuel told King Saul that the time had come for Jehovah to execute judgment on the Amalekites. Saul therefore was to exterminate this enemy nation along with its livestock.
After his victory, however, Saul allowed his soldiers to preserve alive Agag, the king of the Amalekites.
Saul also spared the best of their livestock as something that could be sacrificed to Jehovah.
What was Jehovah’s reaction?
He rejected Saul for his disobedience.
(Read 1 Samuel 15: 22, 23.) What do we learn from this?
That to be acceptable to God, a sacrifice must be accompanied by obedience to his commands.
The bad conduct of certain Israelites who made sacrifices in Isaiah’s day showed what?
A similar example is found in the book of Isaiah.
In Isaiah’s day, the Israelites were going through the motions of sacrificing to Jehovah.
Their bad behavior, however, made their sacrifices invalid.
“Of what benefit to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? ”
“I have had enough of whole burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well - fed animals; and in the blood of young bulls and male lambs and he - goats I have taken no delight....
Stop bringing in any more valueless grain offerings.
Incense ​ — it is something detestable to me. ”
What was the problem?
God told them: “Even though you make many prayers, I am not listening; with bloodshed your very hands have become filled.
Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the badness of your dealings from in front of my eyes; cease to do bad. ” ​ — Isa.
1: 11 - 16.
What determines whether a sacrifice is acceptable to God?
Jehovah took no pleasure in sacrifices offered by unrepentant sinners.
However, the prayers and offerings of those sincerely striving to live in harmony with God’s commands were acceptable to him.
The framework of the Law taught such individuals that they were sinful and in need of forgiveness.
That realization appropriately produced a contrite heart.
Similarly today, we need to recognize our need for Christ’s sacrifice, which is truly capable of atoning for sins.
If we understand and appreciate this, then Jehovah will be “delighted ” with all that we offer him in our dedicated service. ​ — Read Psalm 51: 17, 19.
EXERCISE FAITH IN JESUS ’ SACRIFICE!
17 - 19. (a) How can we appropriately show Jehovah our gratitude for Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice?
(b) What will be considered in the next article?
The advantage we have over those who lived in pre - Christian times is that we no longer have to be content with seeing just “a shadow ” of God’s purposes.
The laws concerning sacrifices encouraged the Jews to develop attitudes appropriate to attaining a good relationship with God ​ — genuine gratitude to him, the desire to give him one’s best, and recognition of the need for redemption.
Thanks to the explanations in the Christian Greek Scriptures, we can understand that by means of the ransom, Jehovah will permanently remove the effects of sin and that even now he allows us to have a good conscience before him.
Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice is a wonderful provision! ​ — Gal.
3: 13; Heb. 9: 9, 14.
Of course, more than a simple understanding of the ransom sacrifice is needed in order for us to benefit from it.
“The Law has become our tutor leading to Christ, that we might be declared righteous due to faith, ” wrote the apostle Paul.
And such faith cannot be devoid of works.
Paul thus encouraged first - century Christians who possessed the framework of knowledge conveyed by the Mosaic Law to put that knowledge into practice.
By so doing, their conduct would harmonize with the divine principles they taught. ​ — Read Romans 2: 21 - 23.
Although Christians today are not required to observe the Mosaic Law, they must still present sacrifices that are acceptable to Jehovah.
How we can do this will be the subject of the following article.

“Whatever you are doing, work at it whole - souled as to Jehovah. ” ​ — COL.
3: 23. How can we honor Jehovah in our everyday activities?
What sacrifices do we make in our worship of God?
How can we offer our material things to Jehovah?
1 - 3. (a) Did Jesus ’ death on the torture stake mean that Jehovah no longer required any kind of sacrifice from us?
Explain. (b) What question arises with regard to sacrifices today?
IN THE first century C.E., Jehovah revealed to his people that Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice had abolished the Mosaic Law.
All the sacrificial offerings that the Jews had been making for hundreds of years were no longer necessary and no longer had any value.
The Law had fulfilled its function as a “tutor leading to Christ. ” ​ — Gal.
3: 24. That is not to say that Christians are no longer interested in sacrifices.
On the contrary, the apostle Peter spoke of the need to “offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. ”
Moreover, the apostle Paul had made it clear that a dedicated Christian’s life ​ — every aspect of it — ​ may appropriately be considered “a sacrifice. ” ​ — Rom. 12: 1.
So, then, a Christian makes sacrifices for Jehovah, either by offering up certain things to him or by giving up certain things for him.
On the basis of what we know about the requirements that existed for the Israelites, how can we be sure that all our sacrifices today are acceptable to Jehovah?
IN EVERYDAY LIFE
What must we remember about everyday activities of life?
As we go about our everyday lives, it might seem difficult to relate our activities to making sacrifices for Jehovah.
Housework, schoolwork, secular work, shopping, and the like might on the surface seem to have little to do with spiritual concerns.
However, if you have dedicated your life to Jehovah or hope to do so in the near future, then the spirit with which you approach mundane activities is important.
We are Christians 24 hours a day. Scriptural principles need to be applied in every aspect of our lives.
Hence, Paul urged us: “Whatever you are doing, work at it whole - souled as to Jehovah, and not to men. ” ​ — Read Colossians 3: 18 - 24.
5, 6.
What considerations should affect our everyday dress and conduct?
A Christian’s day - to - day activities are not part of his sacred service.
Yet, the fact that Paul urges us to work “whole - souled as to Jehovah ” makes us think about our entire course of life.
So how might we apply this to ourselves? Do we act and dress with proper decorum at all times?
Or while engaging in day - to - day activities, might we be embarrassed to identify ourselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses, either because of the way we behave or because of the way we dress?
Never may that be!
Jehovah’s people would not want to do anything that might reflect badly on God’s name. ​ — Isa.
43: 10; 2 Cor.
6: 3, 4, 9.
Let us examine how a desire to work “whole - souled as to Jehovah ” affects a number of different areas of life.
As we do so, bear in mind that all sacrifices that the Israelites presented to Jehovah had to be the very best they had. ​ — Ex.
23: 19.
HOW YOUR LIFE IS AFFECTED
What is involved in Christian dedication?
In effect, you said that in every aspect of your life, you would put Jehovah first. (Read Hebrews 10: 7.)
That was a good decision.
Doubtless you have seen that when you seek Jehovah’s will in a matter and strive to work in harmony with it, the results are excellent.
God’s people are holy and joyful because they reflect the qualities of the One who instructs them. ​ — Lev.
11: 44; 1 Tim.
1: 11.
Of what significance is it to us that Jehovah considered ancient sacrifices to be holy?
The sacrifices that the Israelites made to Jehovah were considered to be holy.
The Hebrew term translated “holiness ” conveys the idea of separateness, exclusiveness, or sanctification to God.
In order for our sacrifices to be acceptable to Jehovah, they must be separate from and uncontaminated by worldly influences.
We cannot be loving any of the things that Jehovah hates. (Read 1 John 2: 15 - 17.)
Clearly, this means that we have to avoid any associations or involvements that would defile us from God’s point of view.
3: 5, 6.
How important is a Christian’s conduct toward others, and why?
Paul urged fellow believers: “Do not forget the doing of good and the sharing of things with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. ”
So being good and doing good to others as a matter of course is something that Jehovah views as an acceptable sacrifice to him.
Loving concern for others is a distinguishing mark of true Christians. ​ — John 13: 34, 35; Col.
1: 10. SACRIFICES IN WORSHIP
10, 11.
How does Jehovah view our Christian ministry and worship, and what effect should this have on us?
One of the most obvious ways in which we as Christians do good things for others is through “the public declaration of our hope. ”
Do you seize every opportunity to give a witness?
Paul called this essential Christian activity “a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to [God’s] name. ”
Much could be said about the quantity and quality of the time that we spend preaching the good news of the Kingdom, and many Service Meeting parts are designed to stimulate our thinking on this matter.
Briefly stated, however, since our field service and informal witnessing activities are “a sacrifice of praise, ” a part of our worship, that sacrifice should be of the very best that we can offer.
While circumstances vary, the amount of time that we devote to announcing the good news often reflects our appreciation for spiritual things.
Christians regularly spend time in private or group worship. Jehovah requires us to do so.
It is true that we no longer have to observe a strict Sabbath rest or make regular trips to festivals in Jerusalem.
However, those ancient observances do have their counterparts in Christian life.
God still expects us to desist from dead works and to study his Word, pray, and attend Christian meetings.
And Christian family heads take the initiative in conducting family worship with the members of their own households.
Regarding our spiritual activities, we do well to ask ourselves, ‘ Could I improve the quality of my worship? ’
(a) The offering of incense in ancient worship can be compared to what today?
(b) How should this comparison affect the content of our prayers?
King David sang to Jehovah: “May my prayer be prepared as incense before you. ”
Think for a moment about your prayers ​ — about their regularity and their quality.
The book of Revelation likens “the prayers of the holy ones ” to incense in that acceptable prayers rise to Jehovah like a sweet - smelling and pleasant odor.
In ancient Israel, the incense that was regularly offered on Jehovah’s altar had to be carefully and precisely prepared.
It was acceptable to Jehovah only if offered according to the guidelines that he had established.
If our heartfelt prayers are similarly formulated, then we can be sure that they are acceptable to Jehovah.
GIVING AND RECEIVING
13, 14. (a) What service did Epaphroditus and the Philippian congregation perform for Paul, and how did the apostle feel about it?
(b) How can we follow the example of Epaphroditus and the Philippians?
Financial contributions made to support the worldwide work can be likened to a sacrifice, whether we offer much or little.
In the first century C.E., the congregation in Philippi sent Epaphroditus to Rome in order to care for Paul’s physical needs. That envoy of the Philippians evidently carried with him a monetary gift from the congregation.
This was not the first time that the Philippians had shown generosity to Paul.
By their kindness they intended to free Paul of financial worries so that he could devote more time to the ministry.
How did Paul view the gift?
He called it “a sweet - smelling odor, an acceptable sacrifice, well - pleasing to God. ” (Read Philippians 4: 15 - 19.)
Paul truly appreciated the Philippians ’ kind gesture, and so did Jehovah.
Likewise today, Jehovah deeply appreciates our contributions to the worldwide work.
Moreover, he promises that if we continue to put Kingdom interests first in our lives, he will take care of all our needs, spiritual and physical. ​ — Matt.
6: 33; Luke 6: 38.
What are some of the things for which you are grateful to Jehovah?
It would take a long time to enumerate the many reasons we have for being grateful to Jehovah.
Is it not true that we should thank him each day for the gift of life?
He gives us all that we need to sustain ourselves ​ — food, clothing, and shelter as well as every breath that we take.
Moreover, our faith, based on accurate knowledge, gives us hope.
It is appropriate that we worship Jehovah and offer sacrifices of praise to him, simply because of who he is and what he has done for us. ​ — Read Revelation 4: 11.
How should we respond to Christ’s ransom sacrifice?
As we have seen in the preceding article, an especially precious gift of God to mankind is Christ’s ransom sacrifice.
This is an outstanding manifestation of God’s love for us.
What is the appropriate response to it?
Paul declared: “The love the Christ has compels us, because this is what we have judged, that one man died for all;... and he died for all that those who live might live no longer for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised up. ”
In effect, Paul was saying that if we appreciate God’s undeserved kindness, we will use our lives to honor Him and His Son.
Our love and appreciation for God and Christ is expressed through our obedience and by our desire to preach and make disciples. ​ — 1 Tim.
2: 3, 4; 1 John 5: 3.
17, 18.
In what ways have some increased their sacrifice of praise to Jehovah?
Give an example.
Would it be possible for you to improve the sacrifice of praise that you offer to God?
After reflecting on all the good that Jehovah has done for them, many have been moved to organize their time and activities to increase their participation in the Kingdom - preaching work or other theocratic activities.
Some have been able to auxiliary pioneer for one or more months each year, while others have been able to enter the ranks of the regular pioneers.
Still others have engaged in Kingdom construction projects.
Are not these excellent ways to show one’s appreciation?
If performed with the right motive ​ — to show gratitude and give thanks — ​ these acts of sacred service are acceptable to God.
Many Christians have felt a debt of gratitude to Jehovah and have been motivated by it.
One such person is Morena.
She searched for answers to her spiritual questions in Catholicism, the religion in which she was raised, and in Asian philosophy.
But she found no satisfying answers in either.
Morena was so grateful for the Scriptural answers to all her questions and for the stability that those answers gave to her life that she wanted to thank Jehovah by using all her energies in his service.
She began auxiliary pioneering on a regular basis immediately after her baptism, and as soon as her circumstances allowed for it, she became a regular pioneer.
That was 30 years ago, and Morena is still in full - time service.
How might it be possible for you to increase your sacrifices to Jehovah?
Of course, there are many faithful servants of Jehovah whose circumstances do not allow them to serve as pioneers.
Whatever we can do in Jehovah’s service, all of us can offer acceptable spiritual sacrifices to him.
In our conduct, we need to observe righteous principles carefully, mindful that we represent Jehovah at all times.
In faith, we put full trust in the outworking of God’s purposes.
In fine works, we help spread the good news.
Out of our heart’s abundance and out of appreciation for all that Jehovah has done for us, let us continue to make whole - souled sacrifices for Jehovah.

Does Jehovah’s goodness motivate you to improve your sacrifice of praise?
[Picture on page 23]
Do you seize every opportunity to give a witness?
“You are ‘ a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special possession. ’ ” ​ — 1 PET.
2: 9. When was a royal priesthood first promised?
How does the new covenant produce the royal priesthood?
What benefits will the royal priesthood bring to mankind?
Why is “the Lord’s evening meal ” also called the Memorial, and what is its purpose?
DURING the evening of Nisan 14 in the year 33 C.E., Jesus Christ and his 12 apostles observed the Jewish Passover for the last time.
After dismissing the traitorous Judas Iscariot, Jesus introduced a different observance, later called “the Lord’s evening meal. ”
Jesus twice said: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me. ” This event is also known as the Memorial, a memorial of Christ with emphasis on his death.
In obedience to this command, Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide observe the Memorial annually.
In 2012, Nisan 14 of the Bible calendar begins at sundown, Thursday, April 5.
What did Jesus say about the emblems he used?
The disciple Luke sums up in two verses what Jesus did and said on that occasion: “He took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying: ‘ This means my body which is to be given in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me. ’
Also, the cup in the same way after they had the evening meal, he saying: ‘ This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf. ’ ”
How would the apostles have understood these words?
How would the apostles have understood the meaning of the emblems?
As Jews, the apostles were well - acquainted with animal sacrifices that priests offered to God at the temple in Jerusalem.
Such offerings were made to gain Jehovah’s favor, and many served as a token covering for sin.
So the apostles could understand that when Jesus said that his body and blood were ‘ to be given and to be poured out in their behalf, ’ he meant that he was to give his own perfect life as a sacrifice.
It would be a sacrifice of far greater worth than that of animals.
What did Jesus mean when he said: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood ”?
What about Jesus ’ words “this cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood ”?
The apostles knew the prophecy about the new covenant, recorded at Jeremiah 31: 31 - 33. (Read.)
Jesus ’ words indicated that he was now introducing that new covenant, which would replace the Law covenant that Jehovah had established with Israel through Moses.
Were the two covenants related?
What prospects did the Law covenant offer Israel?
Yes, their purposes were closely linked.
When introducing the Law covenant, Jehovah told the nation: “If you will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant, then you will certainly become my special property out of all other peoples, because the whole earth belongs to me.
And you yourselves will become to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. ”
What would these words have meant to the Israelites?
THE PROMISE OF A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD
Of what promise was the Law covenant a further development?
The Israelites understood the term “covenant, ” for Jehovah had concluded such solemn agreements with their forefathers Noah and Abraham.
As part of his covenant with Abraham, Jehovah had promised: “By means of your seed all nations of the earth will certainly bless themselves. ”
The Law covenant was a further development of this promise.
On the basis of it, Israel could become Jehovah’s “special property out of all other peoples. ”
For what purpose?
To ‘ become to Jehovah a kingdom of priests. ’
What was meant by the expression “a kingdom of priests ”?
The Israelites were familiar with kings and priests, but Melchizedek was the only man of the past who had held both offices at the same time with Jehovah’s approval.
Jehovah now offered to the nation the opportunity of producing “a kingdom of priests. ”
As inspired writings later indicated, this meant the opportunity to furnish a royal priesthood, kings who would also be priests. ​ — 1 Pet. 2: 9.
What services do divinely appointed priests provide?
A king, of course, rules.
But what does a priest do?
Hebrews 5: 1 explains: “Every high priest taken from among men is appointed in behalf of men over the things pertaining to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. ”
So a priest appointed by Jehovah represents sinful people before God by means of prescribed offerings, pleading with Him on their behalf.
Conversely, a priest also represents Jehovah before people, instructing them in divine law.
In these ways, a divinely appointed priest works to reconcile people to God.
(a) On what condition could Israel realize the promise of providing “a kingdom of priests ”?
(b) Why did Jehovah establish a priesthood within Israel?
(c) What prevented Israel from furnishing “a kingdom of priests ” under the Law covenant?
The Law covenant thus offered to Israel the opportunity to produce a royal priesthood that would benefit “all other peoples. ”
This awesome prospect came with a condition, though: “If you will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant. ”
Could the Israelites ‘ strictly obey Jehovah’s voice ’?
Yes, to a certain degree.
Could they do so perfectly?
No. For that reason, Jehovah established in the meantime a priesthood within Israel, separate from any kingship, to offer animal sacrifices for sins that the Israelites would inevitably commit.
These sins included those of the priests themselves.
Jehovah accepted such sacrifices, but they could not fully compensate for the sins of the offerers.
The priesthood under the Law covenant could not fully reconcile even sincere Israelites to God.
The apostle Paul put it this way: “It is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take sins away. ”
Because of their violating the Law, the Israelites actually came under a curse.
They could hardly serve the world as a royal priesthood in such a condition.
What purpose did the Law covenant serve?
Was Jehovah’s promise that they could furnish “a kingdom of priests ” therefore an empty one?
If they sincerely tried to obey, they would have this opportunity ​ — but not under the Law.
(Read Galatians 3: 19 - 25.)
For those who faithfully endeavored to observe it, the Law had the effect of preserving pure worship.
It made the Jews aware of their transgressions and of the need for a sacrifice greater than their high priest could offer.
It was a tutor that would lead them to the Christ, or Messiah, titles that mean “Anointed One. ”
However, when the Messiah arrived, he would introduce the new covenant foretold by Jeremiah.
Those who accepted the Christ were invited to become party to the new covenant and would actually become “a kingdom of priests. ”
THE NEW COVENANT PRODUCES A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD
How did Jesus become the foundation of a royal priesthood?
In 29 C.E., the Messiah arrived in the person of Jesus of Nazareth.
At about 30 years of age, he presented himself to do Jehovah’s special will for him, symbolizing this by water baptism.
Jehovah acknowledged him as “my Son, the beloved, ” anointing him, not with oil, but with holy spirit.
That anointing commissioned him as High Priest for believing ones of the entire human family and as their future King.
He would be the foundation of a truly royal priesthood.
What did Jesus ’ sacrifice make possible?
As High Priest, what sacrifice could Jesus offer that would completely cover the inherited sin of believing ones?
As he indicated when instituting the Memorial of his death, his own perfect human life was the sacrifice. (Read Hebrews 9: 11, 12.) From the time of his baptism in 29 C.E., Jesus as High Priest submitted to tests and training until the time of his actual death.
After he was resurrected, he ascended to heaven and presented the value of his sacrifice to Jehovah himself.
Thereafter, Jesus could plead with Jehovah on behalf of those exercising faith in his sacrifice and assist them to serve God with everlasting life in view.
His sacrifice also served to validate the new covenant. ​ — Heb.
8: 6; 9: 15. What were the prospects of those invited to be in the new covenant?
Those invited to be in the new covenant were also to be anointed with holy spirit.
Faithful Jews and then Gentiles were included.
What were the prospects of those in the new covenant?
They would receive true forgiveness of their sins.
Jehovah had promised: “I shall forgive their error, and their sin I shall remember no more. ”
With their sins legally canceled, they would be in a position to become “a kingdom of priests. ”
Addressing anointed Christians, Peter wrote: “You are ‘ a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special possession, that you should declare abroad the excellencies ’ of the one that called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. ”
Peter here quotes Jehovah’s words to Israel when introducing the Law and applies them to Christians in the new covenant. ​ — Ex.
19: 5, 6.
A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD BRINGS BENEFITS TO ALL MANKIND
Where would the royal priesthood serve?
Where would those in the new covenant serve?
On earth, where, as a group, they would serve as a priesthood, representing Jehovah to people by ‘ declaring abroad his excellencies ’ and providing spiritual food.
After their death and resurrection, they would serve with Christ in heaven as both kings and priests, fully carrying out the functions of both offices.
Confirming this, the apostle John saw in vision a number of spirit creatures near Jehovah’s throne in heaven.
In “a new song ” addressed to“ the Lamb, ” they sing: “With your blood you bought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and you made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God, and they are to rule as kings over the earth. ”
In a later vision, John says of these rulers: “They will be priests of God and of the Christ, and will rule as kings with him for the thousand years. ”
Together with Christ, they make up a royal priesthood to benefit all mankind.
15, 16.
What benefits will the royal priesthood bring to mankind?
What benefits will the 144,000 bring to those on earth?
Revelation chapter 21 portrays them as a heavenly city, New Jerusalem, called “the Lamb’s wife. ”
Verses 2 to 4 state: “I saw also the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God and prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples.
And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away. ’ ”
What wonderful blessings!
The elimination of death will remove the principal cause of tears, mourning, outcry, and pain.
It will mean lifting faithful humans to perfection, completely reconciling them to God.
Further describing the blessings this royal priesthood will bring, Revelation 22: 1, 2 states: “He showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of [New Jerusalem’s] broad way.
And on this side of the river and on that side there were trees of life producing twelve crops of fruit, yielding their fruits each month.
And the leaves of the trees were for the curing of the nations. ”
With these symbolic provisions, “the nations, ” or family groups of mankind, will be completely cured of the imperfection inherited from Adam.
Truly, ‘ the former things will have passed away. ’
THE ROYAL PRIESTHOOD COMPLETES ITS WORK
What will the royal priesthood eventually accomplish?
As High Priest and King, Christ will then present the completely restored human family to Jehovah.
(Read 1 Corinthians 15: 22 - 26.)
The royal priesthood will have fully accomplished its purpose.
After the royal priesthood has accomplished its work, how will Jehovah use Christ’s associates?
Thereafter, how will Jehovah use these highly privileged associates of Christ?
According to Revelation 22: 5, “they will rule as kings forever and ever. ”
The Bible does not say.
But the quality of life that they possess and their experience in helping a world of imperfect people will equip them to hold a regal position in Jehovah’s purposes forever.
Of what will those present at the Memorial be reminded?
When we gather to observe the Memorial of Jesus ’ death on Thursday, April 5, 2012, these Bible teachings will be on our minds.
The small remnant of anointed Christians still on earth will partake of the emblems of unleavened bread and red wine, signifying their being party to the new covenant.
These symbols of Christ’s sacrifice will remind them of their awesome privileges and responsibilities in God’s eternal purpose.
May all of us attend with profound appreciation for Jehovah God’s provision of a royal priesthood to benefit all mankind.

The royal priesthood will bring eternal benefits to mankind
JEHOVAH’S people have a very rich spiritual heritage. The fascinating record of that heritage can be gleaned not only from publications but also from photographs, letters, personal accounts, and artifacts related to our worship, our preaching work, and our history.
But of what benefit is it to preserve such material and delve into our past?
Well, family heads in ancient Israel were to make known to their sons the laws and wonderful acts of Jehovah so that they might “set their confidence in God himself. ” ​ — Ps.
78: 1 - 7.
Archival research has long played a role in the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose.
When opposers tried to stop work on the temple in Jerusalem, for instance, an official search of records in the archives at the Median capital of Ecbatana brought to light a document issued by King Cyrus authorizing such construction.
Thus, the temple was rebuilt in harmony with God’s will.
Archival sources were also used by the Gospel writer Luke, who “traced all things from the start with accuracy. ” ​ — Luke 1: 1 - 4.
The Governing Body is keenly interested in our theocratic history.
In commenting on the need to preserve, document, and pass on our spiritual heritage, one member of the Governing Body said, “To know where we are going, we have to know where we have come from. ”
To that end, Writing Archives was recently set up at world headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, and is under the direction of the Writing Committee.
OUR “FAMILY ALBUM ” AND“ HEIRLOOMS ”
With time, the past recedes, and most of us likely wish we had kept a more complete personal family record.
In Writing Archives, diligent work is now under way to preserve and document our rich and growing legacy.
Photographs carefully held in the Archives could be considered part of our “family album. ”
Our early publications, thrilling first - person accounts, and priceless memorabilia are also among the gems held in the Archives.
Such items are “heirlooms ” that enlighten us about our theocratic heritage and help us to look forward with confidence to the future of our spiritual family.
We invite you to look into Writing Archives through the new feature “From Our Archives. ”
It will appear periodically in the study edition of The Watchtower.
In a coming issue, for example, we plan to publish an illustrated account designed to answer these questions: What was a Dawn Mobile?
By whom was it used?
When was it in use, and for what purpose?
Like a family album of memories, the Archives collection tells us much about us and our spiritual forebears ​ — about the faith and courage of those who have gone before us, about the joys and challenges of serving our loving heavenly Father, and about God’s guidance and unfailing support of his people.
We are confident that Jehovah will bless ongoing efforts to preserve our spiritual history so that we are ever more united and strengthened to carry out his will.
[Box / ​ Picture on page 31]
During the preparation of Christian literature, DVDs, and other Bible - based material, our writers, artists, researchers, and others draw on archival resources.
Writing Archives therefore takes great care and practical steps to gather and preserve a wide range of historical materials from such sources as branch offices, Bethel departments, congregations, individuals, and secular institutions.
Consider the following overview of this work:
Acquisition and Analysis: Unique items are continually being added to the Archives collection.
Many of these are kindly donated or are loaned by individuals whose families have decades - long records of faithful service to Jehovah.
Analyzing and comparing such material helps to increase our understanding of our history and of those who lived through it.
Cataloging: The Writing Archives collection is made up of thousands of items, some more than a century old.
They come in different shapes, sizes, and formats and must be carefully cataloged for future use.
Restoration and Preservation: Fragile books and artifacts are repaired and preserved using professional restoration methods.
Documents, photographs, news clippings, films, and recordings are digitized.
They can therefore be accessed electronically to avoid handling original documents or other items of historical value.
Storage and Retrieval: Archival materials are stored in an orderly and secure way to prevent loss and to protect them against damage from light and moisture.
A database is being developed as an aid in research and retrieval of these precious gems from our past.

‘ How Will I Be Able to Preach? ’
Throughout the world, we have outstanding examples of brothers and sisters who faithfully share in the preaching work despite coping with serious health problems.
Take, as an example, Dalia, who lives in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania.
Dalia is a sister in her mid - 30 ’ s.
Since birth, she has suffered from the effects of cerebral apoplexy. That disorder has left her paralyzed and with a serious speech impediment.
As a result, only family members are able to understand her well. Dalia lives with her mother, Galina, who cares for her needs.
Although Dalia’s life has been filled with adversity and anxiety, she maintains a positive outlook.
How is that possible?
Galina explains: “In 1999, my cousin Apolonija came to visit us.
Before long, a Bible study was started with Dalia.
Occasionally, I joined them in the study to help interpret Dalia’s speech.
I noticed, though, that everything that she was learning really benefited her.
Soon I too requested a Bible study. ” As Dalia began to understand Bible truths, one question started to bother her more and more.
Finally, she spoke up and asked Apolonija: “How is one like me ​ — being paralyzed — ​ able to preach? ”
Apolonija calmly reassured Dalia: “Do not be afraid. Jehovah will help you. ”
And, indeed, Jehovah does.
How, then, does Dalia preach?
Christian sisters help her to prepare letters with a Bible message.
First, Dalia expresses her thoughts to the sisters. Then, they compose a letter containing her thoughts.
Dalia also witnesses by sending text messages on her mobile phone.
And when the weather is favorable, congregation members take her outside to approach people they meet in local parks and on the street.
Dalia and her mother have continued to make spiritual progress. They both dedicated themselves to Jehovah and were baptized in November 2004.
In September 2008, a Polish - speaking group was formed in Vilnius. Since the group had a need for more Kingdom publishers, Dalia and her mother joined it.
Says Dalia: “Some months I get worried when I have not yet been out in service.
But after praying to Jehovah about it, soon someone makes an appointment to go out with me in the ministry. ”
How does our dear sister Dalia feel about her situation? She states: “The disease has paralyzed my body, but it has not paralyzed my mind.
I am so happy to be able to tell others about Jehovah! ”
Making Study Time More Enjoyable and Productive
How can we find more enjoyment in studying the Bible? How can we make our study periods more productive?
Let us briefly consider three important steps that will help us to get the most out of our personal study of the Bible.
1 PRAY: The first step to take is to pray.
We should consider the study of God’s Word to be part of our worship.
Therefore, we need to ask Jehovah to put us in the proper frame of mind and to give us his holy spirit.
Says Barbara, a longtime missionary: “I always pray before I read or study the Bible.
After that, I feel that Jehovah is with me and that he approves of what I am doing. ”
Prayer before study opens our mind and heart to accept fully the abundant spiritual food that is before us.
2 MEDITATE: Because of lack of time, some limit themselves to a superficial reading of God’s Word.
However, they miss out on the benefits they could derive from studying the Bible.
Carlos, who has been serving Jehovah for more than 50 years, has come to realize the importance of setting aside time for meditation to make his study more productive. He says: “I now read fewer pages of the Bible at a time ​ — about two pages each day.
When we take time to meditate, we enhance our knowledge and comprehension of God’s will. ​ — Col.
1: 9 - 11.
3 APPLY: If we see the practical value of an activity, we benefit more from it.
That certainly is true of Bible study.
“Study helps me to overcome problems in daily life, and it prepares me to help others, ” says Gabriel, a young brother who has a regular Bible - study routine.
He adds: “I try to apply in my personal life everything I learn. ”
Yes, there is a wealth of godly knowledge that we can absorb and apply. ​ — Prov.
2: 1 - 5.
REVIEW: What a privilege we have to delve into the knowledge provided by Jehovah, the Source of all wisdom!
Then pause at times to meditate on what you read.
Also, follow through and apply in your daily life the things you learn.
When you take these important steps, you will find that your study of the Bible becomes most enjoyable and productive.
The Bible Changes Lives
WHAT motivated a tobacco farmer to change not only his occupation but also his deeply held religious beliefs?
How did an alcoholic gain the strength to change her lifestyle?
Read what these people have to say.
“I Love Being Part of This Large Family. ” ​ — DINO ALI
YEAR BORN: 1949
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: AUSTRALIA
HISTORY: TOBACCO FARMER
MY PAST: My parents emigrated from Albania in 1939 and settled in Mareeba, a small town in Queensland, Australia.
Many Bosnians, Greeks, Italians, and Serbians, among others, also settled in this area, bringing with them their values, customs, and cultures.
Mareeba was a tobacco - farming area, and my parents began growing that crop.
Soon, my older sister was born, followed by my two older brothers and me.
Sadly, Dad died of a heart attack when I was a year old.
Mum remarried and had four more sons.
We all grew up on my stepfather’s tobacco farm. I left home in my teens.
When I was in my early 20 ’ s, I married my wife, Saime, in the local mosque, since we were both Muslims.
All of my uncles, aunts, and cousins followed the Islamic faith.
I read the Koran and a book about the prophet Muhammad’s history.
The Koran speaks of the prophets mentioned in the Bible, and reading the Bible helped me to understand when they lived.
Jehovah’s Witnesses called at my house and regularly left magazines and books, which both Saime and I enjoyed reading.
I remember having many stimulating debates with the Witnesses on various religious subjects.
On each occasion, they answered my questions from the Bible, rather than giving their personal opinion.
That made a real impression on me.
The Witnesses offered to study the Bible with me and invited me to their meetings, but I always refused.
My immediate priority was to own my own farm and to have a large family.
I never did own a farm, but I eventually did become the proud father of five children.
HOW THE BIBLE CHANGED MY LIFE: Nine years after my first contact with Jehovah’s Witnesses, I had still not changed my religious beliefs.
However, I enjoyed receiving and reading all the publications that they produced.
Every Sunday, Saime and I took time to read this literature.
We kept all the magazines that we had received over the years.
They proved to be a very helpful resource when others began to test the faith that was growing in my heart.
For example, I met an evangelical preacher who tried to pressure me to accept Jesus as my Savior.
He had succeeded in convincing Saime’s brother and one of my half brothers to follow him.
Soon, acquaintances from all sorts of religious backgrounds began trying to convince me to join their religious groups.
Some gave me literature that attacked Jehovah’s Witnesses.
I asked these critics to show me from the Bible the reasons for the doctrines that they taught, but they could not answer my questions.
All this opposition only made me dig deeper into the Bible and do more research, using the literature I had collected from the Witnesses.
Finally, I realized that the time had come for me to act on what I was learning.
I didn’t have a personal Bible study with one of the Witnesses; I just began attending their meetings.
At first, I was very nervous and shy, but I met many friendly people at those meetings, and I enjoyed what I learned.
I made up my mind that I would become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and in 1981, I symbolized my dedication to God by being baptized.
My wife did not oppose my decision, although she sometimes questioned whether I was being deceived.
I continued to share with her the many truths that I was learning.
About a year after my baptism, as we were driving home from vacation, Saime expressed her desire to become a Witness.
I was so surprised that I almost drove off the road! She was baptized in 1982.
Making the needed changes in our lifestyle was not easy.
I had stopped growing tobacco because doing so conflicts with Bible principles.
It took some time before we found acceptable employment that provided a steady income.
Also, for many years after that, some of our relatives refused to visit us.
We tried to treat them according to Bible principles by showing them love.
Eventually, the barriers came down, and now our close relatives no longer shun us.
HOW I HAVE BENEFITED: Going through various tests, whether overcoming my shyness, coping with financial anxieties, or dealing with family opposition, has taught me how patient Jehovah God is in helping me deal with my problems.
For example, I now serve as a congregation elder and must often teach from the platform.
This is still a challenge for me because I battle with stammering as a result of nervousness.
But by means of constant prayer and with Jehovah’s help, I am able to care for this privilege.
My wife and I have grown closer, and the bond we now enjoy is beyond value.
We made mistakes when raising our children but tried our best to inculcate in them the Bible truths that we learned.
In fact, my oldest son and his wife are serving as missionaries.
I remember one occasion shortly after we began attending the meetings of the Witnesses as a family.
I parked the car and looked inside the hall at the crowd gathering there.
I asked my family, “What do you see? ”
Inside were people of different cultures, backgrounds, and tongues ​ — Aboriginals, Albanians, Australians, Croatians — ​ yet they were happily mingling together.
I love being part of this large family of spiritual brothers and sisters, which exists not only in Australia but all over the world. ​ — 1 Peter 5: 9.
“My Sister Never Gave Up on Me. ” ​ — YELENA VLADIMIROVNA SYOMINA
YEAR BORN: 1952
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: RUSSIA
HISTORY: ADDICTED TO ALCOHOL, ATTEMPTED SUICIDE
MY PAST: I was born in Krasnogorsk, a small, peaceful city near Moscow.
I grew up in a family of teachers.
I was a good student and received an education in music.
My future looked bright.
When I married, my husband and I moved to an area where cursing, drunkenness, and smoking were the norm.
I didn’t realize it at the time, but the environment had a bad effect on me.
At first, I went to parties merely to sing and play the guitar.
Once I was there, however, people would invite me to smoke and drink with them.
Soon I was addicted to alcohol.
My addiction began to destroy my life.
It took some time for me to hit rock bottom, but when I did, I could hardly eat anything.
I wanted to die, and I made a clumsy attempt at suicide.
I am thankful that I did not succeed.
Through all of this, my sister visited me regularly.
She had become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and she tried to explain how the Bible could help me.
I wasn’t interested in the Bible, so at first I chased her away.
But my sister never gave up on me.
She showed so much patience and love that I finally agreed to study the Bible.
HOW THE BIBLE CHANGED MY LIFE: After I started studying the Bible, I made a firm resolve to quit drinking.
About that time, I was attacked and beaten by a neighbor who was drunk.
I ended up in the hospital in serious condition.
Four of my ribs were broken, and one of my retinas had been damaged.
During that time, I prayed constantly. A Bible passage that brought me great comfort was Lamentations 3: 55, 56, which says: “I have called out your name, O Jehovah, from a pit of the lowest sort. My voice you must hear.
Do not hide your ear to my relief, to my cry for help. ”
I truly believe that Jehovah answered my prayers.
He gave me the strength to keep from returning to my past.
There were times when I was tempted to start drinking again. I’m happy to say that I never gave in to that temptation.
As I continued studying the Bible, I learned that I needed to support my husband in his role as head of the family.
That wasn’t easy for me to do, as I was accustomed to bossing my husband around.
I prayed for Jehovah’s help.
The change didn’t happen overnight, but gradually I became a better, more supportive wife.
Upon seeing these changes, my dear husband was amazed. Up to that point, he was not interested in the Bible.
But when I decided to quit smoking, he said: “If you will quit smoking, then I’ll start studying the Bible! ”
We both quit smoking on the same day.
HOW I HAVE BENEFITED: My husband kept his promise and began to study the Bible.
Now we read the Bible together every day, meditate on what we read, and try to apply the counsel in our lives.
Words cannot describe how our family life has improved ​ — not to mention how I have benefited personally.
I am grateful to Jehovah for having drawn me to him.
I’m also grateful to my sister, who never gave up on me.
As a result, I’ve learned firsthand that the Bible really does change lives.

Draw Close to God
DOES Jehovah really care about his people?
If so, how deep is his concern for them?
There is only one way that we can know the answers to those questions ​ — through God’s own revelation.
In the Bible, Jehovah clearly reveals how he feels.
Consider the words found at Isaiah 49: 15.
To illustrate the deep feelings that he has for his people, Jehovah, through Isaiah, uses one of the most touching examples that we could imagine.
He begins by asking this thought - provoking question: “Can a wife forget her suckling so that she should not pity the son of her belly? ”
At first glance, the answer seems obvious.
How could a nursing mother forget her suckling? Her baby is completely dependent on her day and night ​ — and it lets her know when it needs attention!
But there is more to Jehovah’s question.
Why does a mother nurse her child and care for its every need?
A mother naturally has pity for, or pities, “the son of her belly. ”
The Hebrew verb here translated “pity ” is also rendered“ show mercy. ”
This Hebrew term can convey the idea of tender compassion for the helpless or vulnerable.
A mother’s compassion for her suckling is one of the strongest emotions that we can imagine.
Sadly, though, not every mother has pity for the baby that longs to nurse at her breast.
We are living in a world in which many men and women are “disloyal, having no natural affection. ”
At times, we hear about mothers who neglect, abuse, or abandon their newborn baby.
Commenting on Isaiah 49: 15, one Bible reference work explains: “Mothers are sinful and their love is sometimes overcome by baseness.
Even the greatest of human love may fail. ”
“Yet, ” Jehovah assures us,“ I myself shall not forget you. ”
Now we can begin to see the point of the question that Jehovah raises, as stated at Isaiah 49: 15.
What he is making here is not so much a comparison as a contrast.
Unlike imperfect mothers, who may fail to show compassion for their helpless infant, Jehovah will never fail or forget to show compassion for his worshippers in need.
Fittingly, the reference work mentioned above says of Isaiah 49: 15: “This is one of the strongest, if not the strongest expression of God’s love in the Old Testament. ”
Is it not comforting to learn about “the tender compassion of our God ”? Why not learn how you can draw closer to Jehovah?
This loving God assures his worshippers: “I will by no means leave you nor by any means forsake you. ” ​ — Hebrews 13: 5.
Suggested Bible reading for February: ▪ Isaiah 43 - 62
Learn From God’s Word
This article raises questions you may have asked and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible.
Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.
Why did God organize the Israelites?
God organized descendants of the patriarch Abraham into a nation and gave them a body of laws.
He called the nation Israel and made it the custodian of true worship and of his Word, the Holy Scriptures.
Thus, people of all nations have benefited. ​ — Read Genesis 22: 18.
God chose the Israelites to be his witnesses.
When they were obedient, they benefited from God’s laws.
By studying the history of the Israelites, we can get to know more about the true God. ​ — Read Isaiah 43: 10, 12.
Why are true Christians organized?
In time, Israel lost God’s favor, and Jehovah replaced that nation with the Christian congregation.
Formerly, the Israelites were witnesses of God.
Now, true Christians serve as Jehovah’s witnesses. ​ — Read Acts 15: 14, 17.
Jesus organized his followers to witness about Jehovah and to make disciples in all nations.
This work is reaching its climax.
For the first time, Jehovah has united millions from all nations in true worship.
True Christians are also organized so that they can encourage and help one another.
Worldwide, they enjoy the same program of Bible instruction at their meetings. ​ — Read Hebrews 10: 24, 25.
In modern times, how did Jehovah’s Witnesses begin?
The modern - day organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses began in the 1870 ’ s.
A small group of Bible students began rediscovering long - lost Bible truths.
They knew that Jesus organized the Christian congregation to preach. So they undertook an international Kingdom - preaching campaign.
In 1931 they adopted the name Jehovah’s Witnesses. ​ — Read Acts 1: 8; 2: 1, 4; 5: 42.
How are Jehovah’s Witnesses organized today?
In the first century, the Christian congregations in many lands benefited from a central governing body that recognized Jesus as the Head of the congregation.
Similarly today, Jehovah’s Witnesses recognize Jesus as their Leader.
They also benefit from the guidance of a Governing Body of experienced elders who provide Scriptural encouragement and direction for the more than 100,000 congregations.
In each congregation, qualified men serve as elders, or overseers.
These men lovingly care for God’s flock. ​ — Read 1 Peter 5: 2, 3.
Jehovah’s Witnesses are organized to preach the good news and to make disciples.
In order to help people everywhere, they translate, print, and distribute Bible study material in over 500 languages.
Like the apostles, they preach from house to house.
They offer to study the Bible personally with sincere lovers of truth.
Since Jehovah’s people focus on pleasing God and helping others, they are an organization of happy people. ​ — Read Psalm 33: 12; Acts 20: 35.
For more information, see chapter 19 of this book, What Does the Bible Really Teach?, published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Our Readers Ask...
▪ Some believed that the earth would end on October 21, 2011.
It did not.
Thus, the prophecy of U.S. radio broadcaster Harold Camping rang hollow.
He predicted that Judgment Day would come on May 21, 2011 ​ — a tremendous earthquake would roll across the globe, and five months later, on October 21, the earth would be annihilated.
The earth, however, will never come to an end. Earth’s Creator will not allow it.
His Word states: “You have solidly fixed the earth, that it may keep standing. ” ​ — Psalm 119: 90.
Some Bible readers may object, however, that this planet will be destroyed by fire.
They point to 2 Peter 3: 7, 10 to support that view: “By the same word the heavens and the earth that are now are stored up for fire and are being reserved to the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly men....
Yet Jehovah’s day will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a hissing noise, but the elements being intensely hot will be dissolved, and earth and the works in it will be discovered. ”
Are the apostle Peter’s words to be taken literally?
Why not? Because the interpretation of these verses must line up with the context of Peter’s letter and with the rest of the Bible.
A literal view of those texts would mean that the heavens, or universe ​ — billions upon billions of stars and other matter — ​ will be consumed by fire because just one speck in its vastness contains wicked humans.
Would you destroy miles of shoreline of sand because one grain is not to your liking?
So neither would Jehovah destroy all of his created universe because rebellion erupted on just one of his creative works.
Besides, such a view is in direct conflict with the words of Jesus Christ, who said: “Happy are the mild - tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth. ”
Would a loving father handicraft a comfortable house for his family only to burn it down?
That would be unthinkable!
Jehovah is not only the Creator but also a loving Father. ​ — Psalm 103: 13; 1 John 4: 8.
Peter uses the term “earth ” in a figurative sense, referring to human society ​ — in this case wicked human society.
Note that Peter draws a parallel with the Flood of Noah’s day.
On that occasion, only wicked mankind was destroyed; the earth itself and righteous Noah and his family survived.
By the same token, Peter’s use of “heavens ” would also be symbolic.
In this case, “heavens ” refers to human rulership over the ungodly.
Thus, the incorrigibly wicked will be gone, as will all wicked governments, which will be dissolved and replaced by God’s heavenly rule, or Kingdom. ​ — Daniel 2: 44.
So, will planet earth come to its end?
What will end is the symbolic earth, or wicked human society.
The earth itself and the future godly human society will last forever. ​ — Proverbs 2: 21, 22.
Who made the earth?
Who made the sea?
Who created you and me?
Who made the butterfly with its colorful wings?
Jehovah God created all things Revelation 4: 11

Imitate Jesus ’ Example of Watchfulness
“Keep on the watch and pray. ” ​ — MATT. 26: 41.
HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER?
How can our prayers demonstrate that we are on the watch?
In what ways can we show that we are watchful in our ministry?
Why is it important that we keep on the watch when under trial, and how can we do so?
1, 2. (a) What questions might arise concerning Jesus ’ example of watchfulness?
(b) Is Jesus ’ perfect example useful for sinful humans?
After all, Jesus was perfect!
What is more, Jesus was at times able to see clearly into the future ​ — even thousands of years beyond his own day!
Did he really need to be watchful? ’
Let us address those questions first so that we can see just how relevant and urgent this subject is.
Is a perfect example helpful for sinful humans?
Yes, because it is possible to learn from a good teacher and his example.
For instance, imagine a man taking his first archery lesson.
He cannot shoot an arrow well enough to hit the target at all, but he takes more lessons and keeps on trying.
To improve, he carefully studies the example of his instructor, who is an expert archer. The student pays attention to how his teacher stands, positions his arms, and uses his fingers on the bowstring.
Little by little, the determined novice learns how much tension to apply to the string; he takes the wind into account, and he keeps on making an effort.
By imitating what he sees his instructor do, he eventually aims his arrows so that they strike closer and closer to the center of the target.
Similarly, we keep on striving to improve as Christians by following Jesus ’ instructions and imitating his perfect example.
(a) How did Jesus indicate that he needed the quality of watchfulness?
(b) What will we consider in this article?
Did Jesus actually need this quality?
For instance, on the final night of his earthly life, Jesus urged his faithful apostles: “Keep on the watch with me. ”
He added: “Keep on the watch and pray continually, that you may not enter into temptation. ”
Though he had manifested watchfulness all along, in those dire hours Jesus especially wanted to be watchful and as close to his heavenly Father as possible.
He knew that his followers needed the same alertness ​ — not just then but in the future.
So let us consider why Jesus wants us to keep on the watch.
Afterward, we will examine three ways in which we can imitate Jesus ’ watchfulness in our daily lives.
WHY JESUS WANTS US TO BE WATCHFUL
What is the connection between what we do not know about the future and our need to be watchful?
In brief, Jesus wants us to remain watchful because of what we do not know and what we do know.
When Jesus was a man on earth, did he know all that the future held?
No, for he humbly acknowledged: “Concerning that day and hour nobody knows, neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but only the Father. ”
At that time, Jesus, “the Son, ” did not know exactly when the end of this wicked world would come.
What about us today? Is our knowledge of the future limited?
Of course it is! We do not know just when Jehovah will send forth his Son to put an end to this wicked system of things.
If we did, would we really need to keep on the watch?
As Jesus explained, the end will come suddenly, unexpectedly; so we need to keep ever watchful. ​ — Read Matthew 24: 43.
5, 6. (a) How does our knowledge of the future and of God’s purposes affect our need to be watchful?
(b) Why should our knowledge about Satan make us more determined to be watchful?
On the other hand, Jesus did know many marvelous things about the future ​ — truths that most people around him did not know at all.
Our knowledge does not approach that of Jesus, but thanks to him, we do know a great deal about God’s Kingdom and what it will accomplish in the near future.
As we look around us, whether at school, at work, or in the territory where we carry out our ministry, do we not observe that most people live in utter darkness regarding these glorious truths?
So here we find another reason for watchfulness.
Like Jesus, we always need to be alert, watching for opportunities to share what we know about God’s Kingdom.
Each such opportunity is precious, and we do not want to squander any. Lives are at stake! ​ — 1 Tim. 4: 16.
Jesus knew something else that led him to remain watchful. He knew that Satan was determined to tempt him, to persecute him, and to break his integrity.
That vicious enemy was always watching for “another convenient time ” to put Jesus to the test.
Jesus never let down his guard.
He wanted to be ready for any test, be it temptation, opposition, or persecution. Cannot much the same be said about us?
We know that Satan is still “like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone. ”
That is why God’s Word exhorts all Christians: “Keep your senses, be watchful. ”
How, though, can we do so?
HOW TO BE WATCHFUL IN PRAYER
7, 8.
Jesus gave what counsel regarding prayer, and what kind of example did he set?
The Bible draws a strong connection between spiritual alertness, or watchfulness, and prayer.
Not long after asking his followers to keep on the watch with him, Jesus said: “Keep on the watch and pray continually, that you may not enter into temptation. ”
Did he mean to limit that counsel to the dire situation they were facing at the moment?
You may recall that he once spent an entire night praying to his Father.
Let us try to picture the scene.
(Read Luke 6: 12, 13.)
It is springtime, likely near the fishing town of Capernaum, Jesus ’ home base in the region.
As evening falls, Jesus goes up one of the mountains that overlook the Sea of Galilee.
As he views the darkening landscape, he perhaps sees the flickering of oil lamps down in Capernaum and other nearby villages.
When Jesus addresses Jehovah, though, he focuses intently on his prayer. Minutes ​ — then hours — ​ pass.
He takes little note as the lights far below go out one by one or as the moon drifts across the sky or as the nocturnal animals forage in the brush.
His prayer likely dwells on the big decision that lies before him ​ — that of choosing his 12 apostles.
We can imagine Jesus immersed in telling his Father all his thoughts and concerns about each disciple as he earnestly begs for guidance and wisdom.
What can we learn from Jesus ’ example of praying all night?
What can we learn from Jesus ’ example?
That we must spend long hours in prayer?
No, for he kindly acknowledged about his followers: “The spirit, of course, is eager, but the flesh is weak. ”
Nevertheless, we can imitate Jesus.
For instance, do we consult our heavenly Father before making any decision that may affect us, our family, or our fellow believers spiritually?
Do our prayers include concerns about our brothers and sisters in the faith?
Do we pray from the heart rather than repeat a set form of expressions?
Notice, too, that Jesus valued intimate, private talk with his Father.
In today’s busy, hectic world, it is all too easy to get so caught up in the rush of life that we forget what matters most.
If we make ample time for in - depth, private prayer, we will be more spiritually alert.
We will draw closer to Jehovah, eager to strengthen our relationship with him and avoid doing anything that might weaken it. ​ — Ps.
25: 14.
HOW TO BE WATCHFUL IN THE PREACHING WORK
What example shows us how Jesus kept alert to opportunities to give a witness?
Jesus was watchful in the work that Jehovah assigned him to do.
There may be some jobs that allow for the worker’s mind to wander without serious consequences.
Many jobs, though, call for keen focus and alertness, and the Christian ministry is certainly like that.
Jesus was ever alert in his work, watching for opportunities to share the good news.
For example, when he and his disciples arrived at the town of Sychar after a long morning of walking, the disciples went to purchase food.
Jesus stayed near the town’s well to rest, but he kept alert, and he saw an opportunity to witness.
A Samaritan woman approached to draw water.
Jesus could have chosen to take a nap. He could have thought of reasons to avoid a conversation.
However, he spoke up, involved the woman in conversation, and gave a powerful witness that affected many lives in that city.
Can we more closely imitate Jesus ’ watchful example, perhaps by striving to be increasingly alert to opportunities to share the good news with people we meet in our day - to - day life?
11, 12. (a) How did Jesus respond to those who sought to distract him from his work?
(b) What balance did Jesus display regarding his work?
At times, well - meaning individuals sought to distract Jesus from his work.
In Capernaum, the crowds were so moved by Jesus ’ miracles of healing that they wanted to keep him there with them.
That is understandable.
However, Jesus ’ mission was to preach to all “the lost sheep of the house of Israel, ” not just those in one city.
So he told those people: “Also to other cities I must declare the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this I was sent forth. ”
Clearly, Jesus ’ life was focused on his ministry.
He allowed nothing to sidetrack him.
Was Jesus so focused on his work that he was a fanatic or an ascetic?
Was he so absorbed in his ministry that he was aloof from the practical needs of families?
No, Jesus set a perfect example of balance.
He enjoyed life, taking pleasure in happy times with his friends.
He valued families, showing profound empathy for their needs and problems, and he freely showed his affection for children. ​ — Read Mark 10: 13 - 16.
How can we imitate Jesus ’ example of watchfulness and balance when it comes to our Kingdom - preaching work?
As we imitate Jesus ’ example of watchfulness, how can we strive for a similar balance?
We do not let this world distract us from our work.
Even well - meaning friends and relatives may urge us to slow down in our ministry or to seek what they see as a normal life. If we imitate Jesus, however, we view our ministry as if it were food.
Our work nourishes us spiritually and brings us delight as well.
Yet, we never want to be extremists, displaying a self - righteous or ascetic spirit.
Like Jesus, we want to be joyful, balanced servants of “the happy God. ” ​ — 1 Tim. 1: 11.
HOW TO BE WATCHFUL IN TIMES OF TRIAL
In times of trial, what tendency do we need to resist, and why?
As we have seen, some of Jesus ’ most urgent exhortations to keep watchful came when he was under severe trial. (Read Mark 14: 37.)
When we face hardships, we need his example more than ever.
Under trial, many tend to forget a vital truth, one so important that the book of Proverbs says it twice: “There exists a way that is upright before a man, but the ways of death are the end of it afterward. ”
If we rely on our own thinking, especially when we face serious problems, we are likely to endanger ourselves and those we love.
What temptation may a family head face during hard economic times?
For example, a family head may face severe pressure in providing materially for “those who are his own. ”
He might be tempted to take a job that repeatedly causes him to miss out on attending Christian meetings, taking the lead in family worship, or participating in the ministry.
If he relies solely on human thinking, such a course could seem justifiable, even upright.
However, it may well result in spiritual sickness or death.
How much better to follow the counsel of Proverbs 3: 5, 6! Said Solomon: “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding.
(a) What example of trusting Jehovah’s wisdom rather than his own did Jesus set?
(b) How are many family heads imitating Jesus ’ example of trusting in Jehovah during hard times?
When Jesus was under trial, he resolutely refused to lean on his own understanding.
Think of it! The wisest man ever to live on this earth chose not to draw on his own wisdom for answers.
For instance, when Satan tempted him, Jesus repeatedly answered with the phrase: “It is written. ”
He relied on his Father’s wisdom to ward off temptation, showing the humility that Satan despises and utterly lacks.
Do we do the same?
A family head who imitates Jesus ’ watchfulness lets God’s Word guide him, especially in trialsome times.
Around the world, thousands of family heads are doing just that.
They are steadfastly putting God’s Kingdom and pure worship first in life, even ahead of material concerns.
Thereby, they take the best care of their families.
Jehovah responds by blessing their efforts to provide for material needs, just as his Word promises. ​ — Matt. 6: 33.
What moves you to imitate Jesus ’ watchfulness?
Without question, Jesus set the best possible example of watchfulness.
His example is practical, beneficial, and even lifesaving.
Remember, Satan is eager to lull you into spiritual sleep ​ — a state of weak faith, lackadaisical worship, and compromised integrity.
Do not let him succeed!
Remain watchful as Jesus did ​ — watchful in your prayers, in your ministry, and in dealing with trials.
By following that course, you will enjoy a rich, happy, fulfilling life even now in the twilight of this dying system of things.
A watchful course will also ensure that when your Master comes to bring this system to its end, he will find you alert and active, doing his Father’s will.
How delighted Jehovah will be to reward you for your faithful course! ​ — Rev. 16: 15.

“Be Courageous and Very Strong ”
“Be courageous and very strong...
Jehovah your God is with you. ” ​ — JOSH.
1: 7 - 9.
HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND?
In what ways did Enoch and Noah display courage?
How were certain women of ancient times exemplary in faith and courage?
What examples of youthful courage impress you?
1, 2. (a) What is sometimes needed to pursue an upright course in life?
(b) What are we going to examine?
COURAGE is the opposite of fear, timidity, and cowardice.
We may think of a courageous person as one who is strong, valiant, even bold.
At times, however, quiet courage is needed in order to pursue an upright course in daily life.
Some people of Bible record were fearless under very trying conditions.
Others displayed courage in circumstances common to Jehovah’s servants in general.
What can we learn from Biblical examples of courage?
How can we be courageous?
COURAGEOUS WITNESSES IN AN UNGODLY WORLD
Enoch foretold what for the ungodly?
It took courage to be a witness of Jehovah among wicked ones on earth before the Flood of Noah’s day.
Yet, Enoch, “the seventh one in line from Adam, ” boldly delivered this prophetic message:“ Look! Jehovah came with his holy myriads, to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly concerning all their ungodly deeds that they did in an ungodly way, and concerning all the shocking things that ungodly sinners spoke against him. ”
Enoch spoke in the past tense because that prophecy was sure to be fulfilled.
And ungodly humans did perish in a global deluge!
Despite what circumstances did Noah ‘ walk with God ’?
The Flood occurred in 2370 B.C.E., over 650 years after Enoch’s prophetic ministry.
Meanwhile, Noah was born, raised a family, and with his sons built the ark.
Wicked angels had materialized fleshly bodies, mated with good - looking women, and fathered the Nephilim.
Moreover, man’s badness had become abundant, and the earth was filled with violence.
(Read 2 Peter 2: 4, 5.)
We need similar courage in these last days.
THEY DISPLAYED FAITH AND COURAGE
How did Moses display faith and courage? Moses had exemplary faith and courage.
From 1513 - 1473 B.C.E., God used him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and direct them in the wilderness.
Moses felt poorly equipped for this assignment, but he accepted it.
He and his brother, Aaron, repeatedly appeared before tyrannical Pharaoh of Egypt and courageously announced the Ten Plagues by which Jehovah disgraced Egyptian gods and delivered His people.
Moses displayed faith and courage because he had God’s unfailing support, even as we do. ​ — Deut.
33: 27.
If we are interrogated by secular authorities, how will we be able to bear witness with courage?
We need courage like that of Moses, for Jesus said: “You will be haled before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them and the nations.
However, when they deliver you up, do not become anxious about how or what you are to speak; for what you are to speak will be given you in that hour; for the ones speaking are not just you, but it is the spirit of your Father that speaks by you. ”
If we are interrogated by secular authorities, Jehovah’s spirit will enable us to bear witness respectfully with faith and courage. ​ — Read Luke 12: 11, 12.
Why was Joshua courageous and successful?
Regular study of God’s Law built up the faith and courage of Moses ’ successor, Joshua.
In 1473 B.C.E., Israel was poised to enter the Promised Land.
“Be courageous and very strong, ” God commanded.
By complying with the Law, Joshua would act wisely and would be successful.
“Do not suffer shock or be terrified, ” he was told,“ for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go. ”
How those words must have strengthened Joshua!
And God certainly was with him, for the major conquest of the Promised Land was completed in only six years ​ — by 1467 B.C.E.
VALIANT WOMEN WHO TOOK THEIR STAND
What example of faith and courage do we have in Rahab?
Through the centuries, many courageous women have taken their stand as valiant worshippers of Jehovah.
For instance, the prostitute Rahab of Jericho exercised faith in God, courageously concealing two spies sent out by Joshua, and then misdirecting the henchmen of that city’s king.
She and her household were preserved when the Israelites took Jericho.
Rahab abandoned her sinful profession, worshipped Jehovah faithfully, and became an ancestress of the Messiah.
How she was blessed for her faith and courage!
How did Deborah, Barak, and Jael show courage?
After Joshua’s death about 1450 B.C.E., judges administered justice in Israel.
Canaanite King Jabin had oppressed the Israelites for 20 years when God had the prophetess Deborah motivate Judge Barak to take action.
Barak assembled 10,000 men on Mount Tabor and was ready to engage in battle with Jabin’s military chief Sisera, who entered the torrent valley of Kishon with his army and its 900 war chariots.
When the Israelites marched into the valley plain, God caused a flash flood that turned the battlefield into a quagmire and immobilized the Canaanite chariots.
Barak’s men prevailed, and “all the camp of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. ”
Sisera himself sought refuge in the tent of Jael, but she killed him while he slept.
In line with Deborah’s prophetic words to Barak, “the beautifying thing ” of this victory went to the woman Jael.
Because Deborah, Barak, and Jael acted courageously, Israel “had no further disturbance for forty years. ” Many godly men and women have displayed similar faith and courage.
OUR WORDS CAN INSPIRE COURAGE
Why can it be said that our words can inspire courage?
What we say can inspire courage in fellow worshippers of Jehovah.
In the 11th century B.C.E., King David told his son Solomon: “Be courageous and strong and act.
Do not be afraid nor be terrified, for Jehovah God, my God, is with you.
He will not desert you or leave you until all the work of the service of Jehovah’s house is finished. ”
Solomon acted courageously and built the splendid temple of Jehovah in Jerusalem.
What effect did the courageous words of an Israelite girl have on one man’s life?
In the tenth century B.C.E., the courageous words of an Israelite girl proved to be a blessing for a leper.
She had been captured by a marauding band and became a servant of the leprous Syrian army chief Naaman.
Having learned about miracles that Jehovah performed through Elisha, she told Naaman’s wife that if her husband would go to Israel, God’s prophet would cure him.
Naaman did go to Israel, was miraculously healed, and became a worshipper of Jehovah.
If you are a young person who loves God as that girl did, he can give you courage to witness to teachers, fellow students, and others.
How did the words of King Hezekiah affect his subjects?
Well - chosen words in times of peril can inspire courage. When the Assyrians marched against Jerusalem in the eighth century B.C.E., King Hezekiah told his subjects: “Be courageous and strong.
Do not be afraid nor be terrified because of the king of Assyria and on account of all the crowd that is with him; for with us there are more than there are with him.
With him there is an arm of flesh, but with us there is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles. ”
How was that expression received?
Why, “the people began to brace themselves upon the words of Hezekiah ”!
Similar words may bolster our own courage and that of other Christians when we are being hounded by persecutors.
What example of courage do we have in King Ahab’s steward Obadiah?
Sometimes courage is shown by what we do not say. In the tenth century B.C.E., King Ahab’s steward Obadiah courageously hid a hundred prophets of Jehovah “by fifties in a cave ” so that they would not be killed at the order of wicked Queen Jezebel.
Like God - fearing Obadiah, many of Jehovah’s loyal present - day servants have courageously protected fellow believers by not giving persecutors information about them.
ESTHER ​ — A COURAGEOUS QUEEN
14, 15.
How did Queen Esther display faith and courage, and with what result?
Queen Esther displayed great faith and courage when a genocide plot hatched by wicked Haman imperiled the Jews throughout the Persian Empire in the fifth century B.C.E.
No wonder they mourned and fasted and undoubtedly prayed with all their heart!
Queen Esther was greatly distressed.
Her cousin Mordecai sent her a copy of the law authorizing the massacre and commanded her to appear before the king to implore favor for her fellow Jews.
But anyone going in to the king when not summoned was put to death. ​ — Esther 4: 4 - 11.
Yet, Mordecai told Esther: ‘ If you are silent, deliverance will come from another place.
But who knows whether it is for a time like this that you attained royal dignity? ’
Esther urged Mordecai to gather the Jews in Shushan and fast in her behalf.
“I shall fast likewise, ” she said,“ and upon that I shall come in to the king, which is not according to the law; and in case I must perish, I must perish. ”
Esther acted courageously, and the book bearing her name shows that God delivered his people.
In our day, anointed Christians and their dedicated associates display similar courage under trial ​ — and the “Hearer of prayer ” is always on their side. ​ — Read Psalm 65: 2; 118: 6.
“TAKE COURAGE ”
What example do our youngsters have in Jesus?
On one occasion in the first century C.E., 12 - year - old Jesus was found at the temple, “sitting in the midst of the teachers and listening to them and questioning them. ”
Moreover, “all those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers. ”
Although he was young, Jesus had the faith and courage needed to question older teachers at the temple.
Bearing in mind Jesus ’ example will help youngsters in the Christian congregation to take full advantage of opportunities to ‘ make a defense before everyone demanding a reason for their hope. ’ ​ — 1 Pet. 3: 15.
Why did Jesus urge his disciples to “take courage, ” and why do we need to act courageously?
Jesus urged others to “take courage. ”
He told his disciples: “Look!
The hour is coming, indeed, it has come, when you will be scattered each one to his own house and you will leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
I have said these things to you that by means of me you may have peace.
In the world you are having tribulation, but take courage!
I have conquered the world. ”
Like Jesus ’ early followers, we face the world’s hatred, but let us not become like the world.
Reflecting on the courageous course of God’s Son can give us courage to remain undefiled by this world.
He triumphed over the world, and so can we. ​ — John 17: 16; Jas.
1: 27. “BE OF GOOD COURAGE! ”
18, 19.
The apostle Paul gave what evidence of faith and courage?
The apostle Paul endured many tests.
On one occasion, Jews in Jerusalem would have torn him to pieces had Roman soldiers not rescued him.
During the night, “the Lord stood by him and said: ‘ Be of good courage!
For as you have been giving a thorough witness on the things about me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome. ’ ”
Paul did just that.
Paul fearlessly rebuked the “superfine apostles, ” who sought to corrupt the congregation in Corinth.
Unlike them, he could point to proof of his apostleship ​ — to imprisonment, beatings, perilous journeys, other dangers, hunger, thirst, and sleepless nights, as well as deep concern for fellow believers.
(Read 2 Corinthians 11: 23 - 28.)
What a record of faith and courage ​ — all of it proof of God - given strength!
20, 21. (a) Give an example showing that we must keep on mustering up courage. (b) Under what circumstances may we need to display courage, and of what can we be certain?
Not all Christians will experience severe persecution. Yet, all need to muster up boldness in order to meet the challenges of life.
To illustrate: A young person in Brazil belonged to a gang.
After studying the Bible, he saw the need to make changes, but usually anyone leaving the gang was killed.
He prayed, and he used scriptures to show the leader why he could not stay in the gang. The young man was released without reprisals and became a Kingdom publisher.
Courage is required to preach the good news.
Christian youths need this quality if they are to maintain integrity at school.
It may take courage to request time off from secular work in order to attend all sessions of a convention. The list could go on and on.
Regardless of the challenges we face, however, Jehovah will hear our ‘ prayers of faith. ’
And surely he can give us his holy spirit so that we can “be courageous and very strong ”!

Preserve the Positive Spirit of the Congregation
“The undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit you show. ” ​ — PHIL.
4: 23. HOW CAN WE PROMOTE A HEALTHY SPIRIT IN THE CONGREGATION...
while associating with our brothers?
by our zeal in the field ministry?
by reporting serious wrongdoing?
For what were the congregations in Philippi and Thyatira commended?
THE first - century Christians in Philippi were materially poor.
However, they were generous and showed exemplary love for their fellow believers.
In closing his inspired letter to them, the apostle Paul could therefore write: “The undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit you show. ”
Because a similar spirit was shown by the Christians in Thyatira, the glorified Jesus Christ told them: “I know your deeds, and your love and faith and ministry and endurance, and that your deeds of late are more than those formerly. ” ​ — Rev. 2: 19.
What part do we play in cultivating the spirit that our congregation displays?
Each congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses today likewise manifests a certain spirit, or dominant attitude.
Some congregations are especially known for showing a warm, loving spirit.
Others are exceptional in their zealous support of the Kingdom - preaching work and in showing high regard for the full - time ministry.
When we as individuals cultivate a positive spirit, we contribute to the unity of the congregation and further its spiritual advancement in general.
On the other hand, a negative spirit on our part can contribute to spiritual drowsiness, a lukewarm attitude, and even the toleration of wrongdoing in the congregation.
What is the spirit of your congregation?
How can you personally help to promote a positive spirit in the congregation?
ENCOURAGE A POSITIVE SPIRIT
3, 4.
How can we “laud [Jehovah] in the big congregation ”?
The psalmist sang: “I will laud you [Jehovah] in the big congregation; among a numerous people I shall praise you. ”
The psalmist did not hold back from praising Jehovah when he was with other servants of God.
Weekly congregation meetings, including the Watchtower Study, present fine opportunities for us to display a zealous spirit when we comment and make expressions of faith.
All of us may well ask ourselves: ‘ Am I taking full advantage of the privilege to participate in meetings?
Do I prepare well for them and make meaningful comments?
As a family head, do I help my children to prepare comments in advance and teach them to answer in their own words? ’
The psalmist David associated the steadfastness of our heart with our singing.
“My heart is steadfast, O God, ” he said,“ my heart is steadfast. I will sing and make melody. ”
The songs used at Christian meetings provide us a fine opportunity to “sing and make melody ” to Jehovah with a steadfast heart.
If we are not familiar with some of the songs, why not practice singing them during Family Worship evening?
May we be determined to ‘ sing to Jehovah throughout our life and make melody to him as long as we are. ’ ​ — Ps.
104: 33.
5, 6.
How may we be hospitable and generous to others, and what does doing so engender in the congregation?
Showing hospitality to our brothers and sisters is another way to engender a loving spirit in the congregation.
In the final chapter of his letter to the Hebrews, Paul includes this exhortation: “Let your brotherly love continue.
Do not forget hospitality. ”
Providing a meal for traveling overseers and their wives or for full - time servants in the congregation is an excellent way to display hospitality.
Think also of widows, single - parent families, or other individuals who may benefit from occasionally joining us for a meal or during our family worship.
Paul directed Timothy to admonish others “to work at good, to be rich in fine works, to be liberal, ready to share, safely treasuring up for themselves a fine foundation for the future, in order that they may get a firm hold on the real life. ”
Paul was recommending that his fellow worshippers cultivate the spirit of generosity.
Even in difficult economic times, we can promote a generous spirit.
A fine way to do this is to provide transportation in the field ministry and to and from the meetings for those needing it.
And what about those who benefit from such acts of loving - kindness?
They would be encouraging a positive spirit in the congregation if they showed appreciation, perhaps by offering what they can to help defray the increasingly high cost of fuel.
Moreover, would not our arranging to spend more time with our spiritual brothers and sisters make them feel needed and loved?
When we abound in good deeds “toward those related to us in the faith ” and are ready to share our time and resources with them, we not only deepen our love for them but also help to build a warm and positive spirit in the congregation. ​ — Gal.
6: 10. How does keeping the personal matters of others confidential help to preserve a good spirit in the congregation?
Consider yet other factors that strengthen the bond of love with our fellow believers: friendship and confidentiality.
(Read Proverbs 18: 24.)
True friends keep personal matters confidential.
When our brothers reveal their innermost thoughts and feelings to us and are sure that these will not become public knowledge, the bond of love that may already exist will grow stronger.
May we promote a loving, familylike spirit in the congregation by being a trustworthy friend who can keep things confidential. ​ — Prov.
20: 19.
BE ZEALOUS IN THE MINISTRY
What counsel did the Laodiceans receive, and why?
When addressing the congregation in Laodicea, Jesus said: “I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot.
I wish you were cold or else hot.
So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am going to vomit you out of my mouth. ”
The Laodiceans lacked zeal for the Christian ministry. Such an attitude likely affected their personal relationships as well.
So Jesus lovingly counseled them: “All those for whom I have affection I reprove and discipline.
Therefore be zealous and repent. ” ​ — Rev. 3: 19.
How does our attitude toward the field ministry affect the spirit of the congregation?
To promote a healthy, positive spirit in the congregation, we should give attention to our zeal for the field service.
The congregation is organized for the purpose of searching out sheeplike individuals in the territory and building them up spiritually.
Hence, we need to share in the disciple - making work with enthusiasm, as Jesus did.
The greater our zeal for the ministry, the more united we will be as “God’s fellow workers. ”
As we observe others in the field service defending their faith and expressing appreciation for spiritual things, we are moved to love and respect them more.
Also, serving “shoulder to shoulder ” in the ministry produces a united spirit in the congregation. ​ — Read Zephaniah 3: 9.
What effect does improving the quality of our field service have on the spirit of others in the congregation?
Our efforts to improve the quality of our ministry also have a good effect on others.
As we show greater concern for the people we meet, and as we endeavor to improve our effectiveness in reaching the hearts of our listeners, our enthusiasm for the ministry increases.
Enthusiasm tends to rub off on our companions.
Jesus sent his disciples out to preach in twos rather than individually.
This not only provided encouragement and training but also heightened their zeal for the ministry.
Do we not appreciate working with zealous Kingdom publishers?
Their enthusiastic spirit encourages us and spurs us on in the preaching work. ​ — Rom. 1: 12.
GUARD AGAINST MURMURING AND WRONGDOING
What kind of spirit did some Israelites in Moses ’ day develop, and what effect did this have on them?
Within just several weeks of their existence as a new nation, the Israelites developed a spirit of discontent and murmuring.
This led to rebellion against Jehovah and his representatives.
Only a small number of the Israelites who left Egypt lived to see the Promised Land.
Why, even Moses was denied entry to that land because of his reaction to the bad spirit of the congregation of Israel!
What can we do today to keep from falling prey to a negative spirit?
How can we guard against developing a complaining spirit?
We must guard against developing a spirit of murmuring.
While cultivating humility and respect for authority will help us, we need to be concerned about those with whom we associate.
A poor choice of entertainment or spending too much time with workmates or school associates who have no regard for righteous principles takes its toll.
We are wise to limit our association with people who are negative or who are promoting an independent attitude. ​ — Prov.
13: 20.
The corruptive influence of murmuring can lead to what other spiritually damaging developments in a congregation?
The corruptive influence of murmuring can lead to other spiritually damaging developments. For example, murmuring can disrupt a congregation’s peace and unity.
Moreover, voicing complaints against fellow believers may not only cause them pain but may also deteriorate into the sins of slander and reviling.
Some murmurers in the first - century congregation were “disregarding lordship and speaking abusively of glorious ones. ”
Such murmuring against responsible men in the congregation certainly did not have God’s approval.
14, 15. (a) Allowing wrongdoing to go on unchecked can have what effect on the entire congregation?
(b) What should we do if we become aware that someone is involved in a secret sin?
What if we become aware that someone is involved in a secret sin, perhaps abusing alcohol, viewing pornography, or living an immoral life?
Our turning a blind eye to gross wrongdoing can hinder the free flow of Jehovah’s holy spirit and threaten the peace of the entire congregation.
Just as the early Christians in Corinth had to clear out badness, so today any corrupting influence must be kept out of the congregation in order to preserve its healthy, positive spirit.
What can you do to contribute to the congregation’s peace?
As was previously mentioned, it is important to maintain confidentiality in certain matters, especially when others share with us their feelings and thoughts.
Even so, when serious sin has been committed, those Scripturally obligated to handle the matter ​ — the elders in the congregation — ​ should be informed.
(Read Leviticus 5: 1.)
So if we know that a brother or a sister has fallen into such wrongdoing, we should encourage that one to approach the elders and seek their help.
If he or she does not do so within a reasonable period of time, though, we should report the wrongdoing.
How does our reporting serious wrongdoing help to preserve the spirit of the congregation?
The Christian congregation is a spiritual haven, and we must help to protect it by reporting serious wrongdoing.
But what if the practicer of gross sin is unrepentant and does not respond to the loving counsel of the elders?
His expulsion from the congregation results in “the destruction, ” or removal, of the corrupting element from among us, and the spirit of the congregation is preserved.
(Read 1 Corinthians 5: 5.)
Yes, preserving the spirit of the congregation requires that each of us take proper action, cooperate with the body of elders, and protect the welfare of fellow believers.
ENCOURAGE “THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT ”
17, 18.
What will help us to “observe the oneness of the spirit ”?
By “devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles, ” Jesus ’ early followers helped to develop a spirit of unity within the congregation.
They valued the Scriptural counsel and direction received from the older men.
Because present - day elders cooperate with the faithful and discreet slave class, all in the congregation are encouraged and assisted to remain united.
When we submit to the Bible - based instruction from Jehovah’s organization and follow the direction of the elders, we give proof that we are “earnestly endeavoring to observe the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace. ” ​ — Eph. 4: 3.
By all means, then, let us work to preserve a healthy, positive spirit in the congregation.
If we do so, we are assured that ‘ the undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ will be with the spirit we show. ’ ​ — Phil. 4: 23.

Happiness Is Possible in a Divided Household
“How do you know but that you will save your [mate]? ” ​ — 1 COR.
7: 16.
What can believers do to cultivate peace in a religiously divided home?
How might a Christian help unbelieving family members to embrace true worship?
What can others do to help fellow believers who live in religiously divided households?
What effect can acceptance of the Kingdom message have on a family?
WHEN Jesus sent out his apostles on one occasion, he said: “As you go, preach, saying, ‘ The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near. ’ ”
This good news would bring peace and happiness to those accepting it with true appreciation.
However, Jesus warned his apostles that many would oppose their Kingdom - preaching work.
An especially painful form of opposition is experienced when family members reject the Kingdom message. ​ — Read Matthew 10: 34 - 36.
Why is happiness not out of reach for Christians who live in religiously divided households?
Does this mean that happiness is out of reach for Christ’s followers who live in religiously divided households? Not at all!
Though family opposition can sometimes be severe, that is not always the case.
Then, too, family opposition is not necessarily permanent.
Much depends on how believers respond to opposition or indifference.
Moreover, Jehovah blesses those who are loyal to him, making them joyful despite unfavorable circumstances.
Believers can add to their own happiness (1) by endeavoring to cultivate peace in the home and (2) by sincerely trying to help unbelieving family members to embrace true worship.
CULTIVATE PEACE IN THE HOME
Why should a Christian in a divided household cultivate peace?
For the seed of righteousness to bear fruit in a family environment, peaceful conditions in the home are essential. (Read James 3: 18.)
Even if a Christian’s family is not yet unified in pure worship, he must make an earnest effort to cultivate peace in the home.
How can this be done?
How may Christians maintain their inner peace?
Christians must maintain their inner peace.
This calls for heartfelt prayer, which can bring us the incomparable “peace of God. ”
Happiness and peace result from taking in knowledge of Jehovah and applying Scriptural principles in life.
Participation in congregation meetings and zealous activity in the field ministry are also vital if we are to enjoy peace and happiness.
Sharing in Christian activities in some way is generally possible for believers living in divided households.
For example, consider Enza, * whose husband is violently opposed.
She engages in the disciple - making work after taking care of her household duties.
Enza says, “Jehovah richly blesses me with good results each time I make the effort to share the good news with others. ”
Such blessings certainly result in peace, satisfaction, and happiness.
What challenge do believers in divided households often face, and what help is available?
This may present a challenge because what they want us to do may at times conflict with Bible principles.
Our holding firmly to right principles may upset some unbelieving family members, but such a stand promotes peace in the long run. Of course, being unyielding when something does not violate Scriptural principles may cause unnecessary friction.
(Read Proverbs 16: 7.)
When facing a challenge, it is important to seek Scriptural counsel from publications of the faithful and discreet slave class and from the elders. ​ — Prov.
11: 14.
6, 7. (a) Why do some oppose family members who begin to study with Jehovah’s Witnesses?
(b) How should a Bible student or a believer respond to family opposition?
Cultivating peace in a household calls for trust in Jehovah and insight into the feelings of unbelieving family members.
Even new Bible students can show discernment in this regard.
Some unbelieving husbands or wives may not object to having their mate study the Bible.
They may even acknowledge that this could be good for the family.
Others, however, may manifest hostility.
Esther, who is now a Witness, admits that she reacted in “pure anger ” when her husband began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
“I either threw out his literature or burned it, ” she says.
Howard, who at first opposed his wife’s Bible study, remarks: “Many husbands are afraid that their wives are being tricked into joining a religious sect.
A husband may not know how to react to this supposed threat and may become antagonistic. ”
A student whose mate is opposed should be helped to see that he does not have to discontinue his Bible study.
Often he will be able to resolve matters by being mild - tempered and showing respect for his unbelieving mate.
Howard says, “I am so grateful that my wife stayed calm and did not overreact! ”
His wife explains: “Howard demanded that I give up studying the Bible.
He said that I was being brainwashed.
Instead of arguing, I said that he could be right, but I also told him that I could not honestly see how.
So I asked him to read the book I was studying.
He did so and could not disagree with what it said. This deeply affected him. ”
It is good to remember that unbelieving spouses may feel abandoned or threatened when their mate leaves to participate in Christian activities, but loving reassurances can go a long way in allaying such feelings.
HELP THEM TO EMBRACE TRUE WORSHIP
What counsel did the apostle Paul give to Christians who have unbelieving mates?
The apostle Paul advises Christians not to leave a marriage partner just because that individual is an unbeliever. * (Read 1 Corinthians 7: 12 - 16.)
Keeping in mind the possibility that an unbelieving marriage mate may become a Christian can help a believer to maintain his or her happiness although living in a divided household.
In trying to reach the unbeliever with the message of the truth, though, a certain caution is in order, as the following experiences bear out.
When introducing Bible truth to unbelieving family members, what caution is in order?
When a Bible student comes to appreciate the truthfulness of what he has been taught from the Scriptures, he may be so happy that he talks about it almost all the time.
He may expect unbelieving family members to accept the Kingdom message immediately, but the good news could be met with an adverse response.
How did Jason’s initial enthusiasm affect his wife?
“I felt overwhelmed, ” she recalls.
One woman who accepted the truth 18 years after her husband did says, “I, for one, needed to learn it gradually. ”
If you are presently conducting a Bible study with a student whose mate has no desire to take part in true worship, why not hold regular practice sessions to help the student to approach issues tactfully?
Moses said: “My instruction will drip as the rain, my saying will trickle as the dew, as gentle rains upon grass. ”
A few well - placed droplets of truth will often do more good than a spiritual downpour would.
10 - 12. (a) What counsel did the apostle Peter give to Christians who have unbelieving mates?
(b) How did one Bible student learn to apply the counsel recorded at 1 Peter 3: 1, 2?
The apostle Peter provided inspired counsel for Christian wives living in religiously divided households.
“Be in subjection to your own husbands, ” he wrote,“ in order that, if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives, because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct together with deep respect. ”
A wife may be able to win her husband over to true worship by being in subjection and showing deep respect for him, even if he treats her harshly.
Likewise, a believing husband should conduct himself in a godly way and be a loving head of the household despite any opposition he may encounter from his unbelieving wife. ​ — 1 Pet. 3: 7 - 9.
Many modern - day examples illustrate the value of applying Peter’s counsel.
Consider the case of Selma.
When she began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses, her husband, Steve, was not pleased.
He admits, “I became angry, jealous, possessive, and insecure. ”
Selma observes: “Even before I got the truth, living with Steve was like walking on eggshells. He was hot - tempered.
When I started studying the Bible, this characteristic intensified. ” What helped?
Selma recalls a lesson she learned from the Witness who studied with her.
“On one particular day, ” says Selma,“ I didn’t want to have a Bible study.
The night before, Steve had hit me as I had tried to prove a point, and I was feeling sad and sorry for myself.
After I told the sister what had happened and how I felt, she asked me to read 1 Corinthians 13: 4 - 7.
As I did, I began to reason, ‘ Steve never does any of these loving things for me. ’
But the sister made me think differently by asking, ‘ How many of those acts of love do you show toward your husband? ’
My answer was, ‘ None, for he is so difficult to live with. ’
The sister softly said, ‘ Selma, who is trying to be a Christian here?
You or Steve? ’
Realizing that I needed to adjust my thinking, I prayed to Jehovah to help me be more loving toward Steve.
Slowly, things started to change. ”
After 17 years, Steve accepted the truth.
HOW OTHERS CAN HELP
13, 14.
How can others in the congregation assist those who live in a religiously divided household?
Like gentle drops of rain that soak the ground and help plants to grow, many individuals in the congregation contribute to the happiness of Christians in divided households.
“The love of my brothers and sisters was what helped me to stand firm in the truth, ” says Elvina in Brazil.
Kindness and interest on the part of others in the congregation can do much to affect the heart of an unbelieving family member.
A husband in Nigeria who accepted the truth 13 years after his wife did states: “While I was traveling with a Witness, his vehicle broke down.
He sought out fellow Witnesses in a neighboring village, and they gave us accommodations for the night.
They cared for us as if we had known them from childhood.
Right away, I felt the Christian love that my wife had always spoken about. ”
In England, a wife who came into the truth 18 years after her husband did recalls: “The Witnesses invited both of us for meals.
I always felt welcome. ”
* Says a husband in the same land who eventually became a Witness: “Brothers and sisters would visit us, or we were invited to their homes, and I found that they had a caring attitude.
This was especially noticeable when I was in the hospital and many came to visit me. ” Can you find ways to show similar interest in unbelieving family members?
15, 16.
What can help a believer to maintain happiness when others in the family remain unbelievers?
Of course, not all unbelieving spouses, children, parents, or other relatives embrace true worship, even after years of faithful conduct and tactful witnessing on the part of the believer.
Some remain indifferent or become unrelenting opposers.
When Christians display godly traits, however, this can have a very good effect.
A former unbelieving husband states: “When the believing mate starts to let those lovely qualities shine, you do not know what is going on in the unbeliever’s mind and heart.
So don’t ever give up on your unbelieving mate. ”
Even if a family member remains an unbeliever, happiness is possible for the believer.
Although her husband has not responded to the Kingdom message after 21 years of effort on her part, one sister says: “I am able to maintain my joy by striving to please Jehovah, by maintaining my loyalty to him, and by working to strengthen my spirituality.
Immersing myself in spiritual activities ​ — personal study, meeting attendance, the field ministry, and helping others in the congregation — ​ has drawn me closer to Jehovah and has safeguarded my heart. ” ​ — Prov.
4: 23.
DO NOT GIVE UP!
17, 18.
How can a Christian remain hopeful even in a religiously divided household?
If you are a faithful Christian living in a religiously divided household, do not give up.
Remember that “Jehovah will not desert his people for the sake of his great name. ”
He is with you as long as you cling to him.
(Read 2 Chronicles 15: 2.)
So “take exquisite delight in Jehovah. ” Indeed,“ roll upon Jehovah your way, and rely upon him. ”
“Persevere in prayer, ” and have faith that our loving heavenly Father can help you to endure hardships of all kinds. ​ — Rom.
12: 12.
Petition Jehovah for his holy spirit to help you promote peace in the home.
Yes, it is possible to foster peaceful conditions that may eventually touch the heart of unbelieving family members.
You will experience happiness and peace of heart and mind as you “do all things for God’s glory. ”
In these endeavors, how heartening it is to know that you have the loving support of your brothers and sisters in the Christian congregation!
Names have been changed.
Paul’s counsel does not rule out legal separation in extreme situations. That is a serious personal decision.
See “Keep Yourselves in God’s Love, ” pages 220 - 221.

They Courageously Proclaimed God’s Word!
Courage ​ — even boldness — ​ in the face of opposition. These qualities are displayed by true Christians, as shown in such publications as “Bearing Thorough Witness ” About God’s Kingdom and Jehovah’s Witnesses ​ — Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom.
Like our first - century fellow believers, we turn to Jehovah in prayer for his spirit and for help to speak his word with boldness. ​ — Acts 4: 23 - 31.
Regarding our preaching work during the first world war, one brother wrote: “God’s servants were energetically distributing the seventh volume of Studies in the Scriptures, entitled The Finished Mystery. It was reaching an unprecedented distribution.
Kingdom News No. 1 was released in 1918. Next came Kingdom News No. 2, explaining why The Finished Mystery was suppressed by the authorities.
This was followed by Kingdom News No. 3.
These publications were widely distributed by the faithful anointed class. It took faith and courage to put out Kingdom News. ”
Today, new Kingdom publishers usually receive training in the ministry, but that was not always so.
Reflecting on his first experience in field service in 1922, one Polish brother in the United States wrote: “Having no knowledge of how to present the literature and speaking very poor English, I stood alone before the office of a doctor and knocked.
A nurse opened the door. I will never forget that experience, for I was excited and frightened.
As I was opening my satchel, all the books fell out at the feet of the nurse.
I do not know what I said, but I placed a publication with her.
By the time I left, I had gained courage and felt blessed by Jehovah.
I placed many booklets that day on that business street. ”
“About 1933, many brothers used sound cars to spread the Kingdom message, ” said a sister.
On one occasion, she and a Witness couple were preaching in a mountainous area of California, U.S.A.
“The brother took the sound car higher up into the mountains, and we stayed down in town, ” she recalled.
“When he began playing the recorded message, it almost sounded as if it came from heaven.
The townspeople tried and tried to find the brother, but they never could.
After the record was finished, we called on the people and witnessed to them.
I worked with two other sound cars and can assure you that most people did not want to hear the message.
But they could not help but hear the talks as the message coming from the sound cars poured into their homes.
We could always see that Jehovah caused the right method to be used at the right time.
The method called for all the courage we could muster, but it always accomplished its purpose, and Jehovah’s name was glorified. ”
In the 1930 ’ s and early 1940 ’ s, phonographs and recorded Bible talks were used in our ministry.
One Christian woman recalled: “A young sister was working from door to door with the phonograph.
After she started playing the record at one door, the man of the house became so infuriated that he kicked the phonograph right off the porch. Not one record was broken.
Three men eating their lunch in a parked truck saw what happened, invited the sister to play the record for them, and obtained literature from her.
That made up for the ill - treatment. ”
It took courage to endure such trials.
The same sister added: “I recall the beginning of the magazine street work in 1940. Earlier, there were information marches.
In single file, brothers and sisters would make their way down the sidewalk carrying signs that read ‘ Religion Is a Snare and a Racket ’ and ‘ Serve God and Christ the King. ’
At the same time, free tracts were passed out to the people.
It took courage to engage in these features of the work, but they served the purpose of keeping Jehovah’s name and people before the eye of the public. ”
“Doing magazine work in small towns was very hard, ” said another sister.
“This was when opposition was strong against the Witnesses....
It took real courage to stand on a corner holding the magazines and calling out the slogans suggested for our use.
Yet, we seldom missed a Saturday. Sometimes people would be friendly.
At other times ugly groups would form, and occasionally we would have to slip away to avoid mob action. ”
Despite persecution experienced during World War II, Jehovah’s Witnesses courageously carried on their ministry.
In a 43 - day campaign from December 1, 1940, through January 12, 1941, about 50,000 publishers in the United States distributed almost eight million booklets during what was called the “Courage ” Testimony Period.
Many older ones in God’s organization vividly remember past challenges that called upon them to muster up courage.
Some recall that for years, their courageous spirit was reflected in their oft repeated adage, Press the battle to the gate!
What form our God - given message will yet take before the present wicked system ends remains to be seen.
With divine help, however, we will continue to proclaim Jehovah’s word with faith and courage.
[Blurb on page 9]
Courage has always been required to engage in the Kingdom - preaching work
Napoleon Bonaparte had it.
Julius Caesar had it. Alexander the Great had it.
Despite all their power and glory, these men harbored in their heart a trait that can poison one’s mind. All three envied someone else.
Envy can plague anyone, regardless of how much wealth he has, whatever virtues he possesses, and how successful he is in life.
Envy is a feeling of resentment toward others because of their belongings, prosperity, advantages, and so forth.
Distinguishing envy from jealousy, a Biblical reference work says: “‘ Jealousy ’... refers to the desire to be as well off as another, and the word ‘ envy ’ refers to the desire to deprive another of what he has. ”
Not only does the envious man begrudge what others have but he wants to take it from them.
We are wise to examine how envy can arise in us and what its consequences are.
Especially do we need to know what measures we can take to prevent envy from controlling our lives.
A SPIRIT THAT CAN FAN THE FLAME OF ENVY
While imperfect humans have “a tendency to envy, ” various factors can feed and strengthen this inclination.
Identifying one of them, the apostle Paul wrote: “Let us not become egotistical, stirring up competition with one another, envying one another. ”
The spirit of competition can make our imperfect leanings toward envy even worse.
Two Christians named Cristina and José * discovered this to be true.
Cristina, a regular pioneer, says: “I often find myself looking enviously at others.
I compare what they have with what I don’t have. ”
On one occasion, Cristina was sharing a meal with a couple who have the privilege of serving in the traveling work.
Aware that she and her husband, Eric, were about the same age as the traveling overseer and his wife and had had similar assignments in the past, Cristina said: “My husband too is an elder!
So how is it that you are in the traveling work and we are nothing? ”
The flame of envy, fanned by a competitive spirit, blinded her to the fine work she and her husband were doing and made her feel dissatisfied with their life.
José desired to serve as a ministerial servant in the congregation.
When he was not appointed but others were, he became envious of them and harbored ill feelings toward the coordinator of the body of elders.
“Envy caused me to nurse a hatred for this brother and to misinterpret his intentions, ” confesses José.
“When envy takes control of your life, you become self - centered and cannot think clearly. ”
WHAT SCRIPTURAL EXAMPLES TEACH US
The Bible contains many warning examples.
Some of these show not only how envy develops but also how it poisons those who allow it to overpower them.
For instance, Adam and Eve’s firstborn son, Cain, felt angry when Jehovah accepted Abel’s sacrifice but not his.
Cain could have remedied this situation, but he became so blinded by envy that he killed his brother.
No wonder the Bible speaks of Cain as one “who originated with the wicked one, ” Satan! ​ — 1 John 3: 12.
Joseph’s ten brothers envied the special relationship Joseph had with their father.
Their hatred for Joseph grew when he told them about his prophetic dreams.
They even wanted to kill him.
Finally, they sold him as a slave and cruelly led their father to believe that Joseph was dead.
Years later, they admitted their sin, saying to one another: “Unquestionably we are guilty with regard to our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul when he implored compassion on our part, but we did not listen. ” ​ — Gen.
42: 21; 50: 15 - 19.
In the case of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, envy arose when they compared their privileges with those of Moses and Aaron.
They accused Moses of ‘ playing the prince ’ and of lifting himself up above others.
This accusation was false.
Jehovah himself had appointed Moses.
But these rebels envied Moses ’ position.
Finally, envy led to their destruction at Jehovah’s hand. ​ — Ps.
106: 16, 17.
King Solomon witnessed the lengths to which envy can go.
A woman whose own newborn baby had died attempted to deceive her companion into thinking that it was her baby who had died.
During the subsequent trial, the liar even consented to the idea of killing the surviving baby.
However, Solomon saw to it that the child was given to the real mother. ​ — 1 Ki.
3: 16 - 27.
Envy can have devastating consequences.
The aforementioned Scriptural examples show that it can lead to hatred, injustice, and murder.
What measures can we take as antidotes to envy?
POWERFUL ANTIDOTES!
Develop love and brotherly affection.
The apostle Peter admonished Christians: “Now that you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth with unhypocritical brotherly affection as the result, love one another intensely from the heart. ”
And what is love?
The apostle Paul wrote: “Love is long - suffering and kind.
Love is not jealous, it does not brag, does not get puffed up, does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests. ”
Would not developing such love for others in our heart stifle a negative tendency to envy?
Instead of envying David, Jonathan ‘ loved him as his own soul. ’ ​ — 1 Sam.
18: 1.
Associate with godly people.
The composer of Psalm 73 felt envious of the wicked who enjoyed a problem - free life of luxury.
However, he conquered his envy by going to “the grand sanctuary of God. ”
Association with fellow worshippers helped the psalmist to recognize the blessings he derived from “drawing near to God. ”
Regularly associating with fellow believers at Christian meetings can do the same for us.
Seek to do good.
After observing that envy and hatred had developed in Cain, God told him: “Turn to doing good. ”
What does “doing good ” entail for Christians?
Jesus said that we ‘ must love Jehovah our God with our whole heart and with our whole soul and with our whole mind and must love our neighbor as ourselves. ’
The satisfaction we derive from centering our lives on serving Jehovah and helping others is a strong antidote to feelings of envy.
Having a meaningful share in the Kingdom - preaching and disciple - making work is a fine way to serve God and our neighbor and brings us “the blessing of Jehovah. ” ​ — Prov.
10: 22.
“Rejoice with people who rejoice. ”
Jesus rejoiced at the success of his disciples, and he pointed out that they would accomplish even more than he had in the preaching work.
We are united as Jehovah’s servants; hence, the success of any one of us is a blessing to all.
Should we not, then, rejoice rather than feel envious when others receive greater responsibility?
NOT AN EASY FIGHT!
The fight against envy can be a long one.
Cristina admits: “I still have a strong tendency toward envy.
Even though I hate it, the feeling is there, and I have to suppress it constantly. ”
José has had a similar fight. “Jehovah helped me to appreciate the good qualities of the coordinator of the body of elders, ” he says.
“A good relationship with God has proved invaluable. ”
Envy is one of “the works of the flesh, ” against which every Christian should fight.
By not allowing envy to control us, we can make our lives happier and can please our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
Names have been changed.

“Rejoice with people who rejoice ”
Nathan ​ — Loyal Advocate of Pure Worship
It is not easy to convince a powerful man that his ways are corrupt and that he needs to reform.
Would you confront such an individual if you knew that he had killed a man in order to save face?
King David of ancient Israel had committed adultery with Bath - sheba, and she became pregnant.
To hide their sin, David had her husband killed and then took Bath - sheba as his wife.
Months passed while David lived a double life, no doubt continuing to perform his official functions.
But Jehovah did not let the king’s sins pass unnoticed.
He sent his prophet Nathan to confront David.
This was a difficult mission.
Put yourself in Nathan’s place.
How could the prophet do this and convince King David that he needed to repent?
TACTFUL TEACHER
Why not take a few minutes to read 2 Samuel 12: 1 - 25?
Imagine that you were standing in Nathan’s place as he told David this story: “There were two men that happened to be in one city, the one rich and the other of little means.
The rich man happened to have very many sheep and cattle; but the man of little means had nothing but one female lamb, a small one, that he had bought.
And he was preserving it alive, and it was growing up with him and with his sons, all together.
From his morsel it would eat, and from his cup it would drink, and in his bosom it would lie, and it came to be as a daughter to him.
After a while a visitor came to the rich man, but he spared taking some from his own sheep and his own cattle to get such ready for the traveler that had come in to him.
So he took the female lamb of the man of little means and got it ready for the man that had come in to him. ” ​ — 2 Sam.
12: 1 - 4.
David ​ — who had been a shepherd himself — ​ evidently believed that this was a real situation.
“Perhaps, ” suggests one expositor,“ Nathan had been accustomed to come to him to plead the cause of the injured who could obtain no redress otherwise, and David imagined this to be his errand now. ”
Even if that was the case, it took loyalty to God as well as courage in order for Nathan to speak to the king as he did.
Nathan’s story made David furious. “As Jehovah is living, the man doing this deserves to die! ” he exclaimed.
Then came Nathan’s crushing declaration: “You yourself are the man! ” ​ — 2 Sam.
12: 5 - 7.
Consider why Nathan addressed the problem as he did.
It is not easy for a person who has become emotionally entangled with someone to view his situation objectively.
All of us tend to make excuses in an attempt to justify ourselves if our actions are questionable.
But Nathan’s illustration moved David unwittingly to condemn his own actions.
The king saw clearly that the conduct Nathan described was deplorable.
Only after David himself had condemned it, however, did Nathan reveal that the illustration applied to the king.
Then David could see the magnitude of his sin. This put him in the right frame of mind to accept reproof.
He acknowledged that he had indeed “despised ” Jehovah by his conduct in connection with Bath - sheba, and he accepted the deserved reproof. ​ — 2 Sam.
12: 9 - 14; Ps. 51, superscription.
What can we learn from this?
A Bible teacher’s objective is to help his listeners arrive at the right conclusion.
Nathan respected David and therefore approached him tactfully.
Nathan knew that at heart David loved righteousness and justice. With his illustration, the prophet appealed to these godly qualities.
How? By appealing to their sense of what is right, doing so without assuming any air of moral or spiritual superiority.
The Bible, not our personal opinion, is our authority regarding what is right and what is wrong.
More than anything else, loyalty to God enabled Nathan to reprove a powerful king.
Similar loyalty will give us the courage to stand firm for Jehovah’s righteous principles.
PROMOTER OF PURE WORSHIP
Apparently, David and Nathan were good friends, for David named one of his sons Nathan.
The first time Nathan appears in the Biblical record, he is in David’s company.
Both of them loved Jehovah.
The king evidently trusted Nathan’s judgment, for he revealed to the prophet his desire to build a temple to Jehovah. “‘ See, now, ’ ” said David,“ ‘ I am dwelling in a house of cedars while the ark of the true God is dwelling in the middle of tent cloths. ’
Upon that Nathan said to the king: ‘ Everything that is in your heart ​ — go, do, because Jehovah is with you. ’ ” ​ — 2 Sam.
7: 2, 3.
As a faithful worshipper of Jehovah, Nathan enthusiastically endorsed David’s plan to construct the first permanent center of pure worship on earth.
On that occasion, however, Nathan apparently expressed his own feelings instead of speaking in Jehovah’s name.
That night, God instructed his prophet to take a different message to the king: David would not build Jehovah’s temple. The person to do so would be one of David’s sons.
But Nathan announced that God was making a covenant with David to the effect that his throne would become “firmly established to time indefinite. ” ​ — 2 Sam.
7: 4 - 16.
God’s will did not harmonize with Nathan’s judgment with respect to temple construction.
Without murmuring, however, this humble prophet acquiesced to Jehovah’s purpose and cooperated with it.
What a fine example to follow if God should correct us in some way!
Nathan’s subsequent acts as a prophet show that he did not lose God’s favor.
In fact, it appears that Jehovah inspired Nathan, together with Gad the visionary, to direct David in organizing 4,000 musicians in temple service. ​ — 1 Chron.
23: 1 - 5; 2 Chron.
29: 25.
DEFENDER OF THE KINGSHIP
Nathan was aware that Solomon was to succeed elderly David as king.
So Nathan acted decisively when Adonijah attempted to usurp the throne during David’s waning years.
Tact and loyalty again characterized Nathan’s actions.
First he urged Bath - sheba to remind David of his sworn intention to make their son Solomon king.
Then Nathan himself entered the king’s presence to ask whether David had authorized Adonijah’s succession.
Realizing the gravity of the situation, the aged king instructed Nathan and other loyal servants to have Solomon anointed and proclaimed king. Adonijah’s coup was thwarted. ​ — 1 Ki.
1: 5 - 53.
UNASSUMING HISTORIAN
Nathan and Gad are generally credited with writing 1 Samuel chapters 25 to 31 as well as all of 2 Samuel 1 - 24.
With regard to the inspired histories recorded in those books, it is stated: “As for the affairs of David the king, the first ones and the last, there they are written among the words of Samuel the seer and among the words of Nathan the prophet and among the words of Gad the visionary. ”
Nathan is also identified with the composition of an account regarding “the affairs of Solomon. ”
Very likely, this means that Nathan continued to be active in affairs of the royal court even after David’s death.
Much of what we know about Nathan may have been written by the prophet himself.
Nathan evidently was an unassuming historian.
He was not ambitious, wanting to make a name for himself.
In the words of one Bible dictionary, he appears in the inspired record “with no introduction and no pedigree. ”
We know nothing about Nathan’s ancestry or personal life.
MOTIVATED BY LOYALTY TO JEHOVAH
From the few glimpses of Nathan given to us in the Scriptures, it is clear that he was a humble but vigorous defender of divine arrangements.
Jehovah God assigned him weighty responsibilities.
Meditate on Nathan’s qualities, such as loyalty to God and deep appreciation for divine requirements.
Strive to imitate such qualities. You are unlikely to be called upon to reprove adulterous kings or to thwart coups.
[Picture on page 25]
As a defender of the kingship, Nathan tactfully spoke to Bath - sheba
When full - time preacher Charlotte White arrived in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S.A., rolling a suitcase on wheels, she caused quite a stir.
THE year was 1908, and Sister White certainly got the attention of the townspeople with a brand new invention ​ — the Dawn - Mobile.
“It caused some comment, ” she reported,“ and made me a little conspicuous. ”
The Bible Students, as Jehovah’s Witnesses were then called, saw the need to share the precious truths they had learned from a diligent study of the Scriptures.
Many had gained Bible knowledge by means of a series of books entitled Millennial Dawn (later also called Studies in the Scriptures).
Those Christians who were willing and able traveled far and wide ​ — through towns, villages, and rural areas — ​ offering these books described as “Helping Hands for Bible Students ” to other eager readers.
In 1908, Sister White and other zealous Kingdom proclaimers would have offered the six - volume, clothbound set for $1.65 (U.S.).
Instead of placing the Dawns on the spot, they would take orders and return later ​ — usually on payday — ​ to deliver them for the modest printing cost.
One opposer complained about how little money people contributed when receiving the books!
Malinda Keefer remembered taking orders for two hundred to three hundred books a week.
But the great interest shown in the Dawns brought with it a dilemma.
Why, the sixth volume alone consisted of 740 pages!
“Fifty books weigh forty pounds, ” (18 kg) admitted The Watch Tower, making deliveries“ too great a strain, ” especially for sisters.
To solve the Dawn delivery dilemma, Brother James Cole invented a foldable, two - wheeled frame to which a suitcase could be attached by screws.
No longer obliged to carry heavy cartons full of books, the inventor himself remarked: “I am not breaking my shoulders. ” He introduced the new apparatus to a delighted audience at the 1908 Bible Students convention in Cincinnati, Ohio.
On buttons at each end of the crossbar was engraved the name Dawn - Mobile, since its main cargo consisted of volumes of Millennial Dawn.
With a little practice, transporting a suitcase filled with dozens of books became an easy, one - handed operation.
The height could be adjusted, and the wheels could roll along wagon - wheel tracks.
After a day in the ministry, the rubber wheels could be folded up against the side of the suitcase for the trip home on foot or by streetcar.
Sisters in full - time service could have a Dawn - Mobile free of charge. Otherwise, it cost $2.50 (U.S.).
Sister Keefer, pictured here, mastered the Dawn - Mobile technique so well that she could wheel a full suitcase with one hand and carry an additional satchel of books in the other.
Finding many receptive individuals in one Pennsylvania, U.S.A., mining town, she typically made three or four trips across a bridge on delivery day.
In the late 1980 ’ s, an airline pilot invented the wheeled luggage that is now such a common sight in airports and on busy city streets.
But some one hundred years ago, zealous Bible Students likely enjoyed the stares of curious onlookers as they conspicuously wheeled their Dawn - Mobiles to and fro while scattering precious seeds of Bible truth.

Are All “Christians ” Christian?
HOW many Christians are there?
According to the Atlas of Global Christianity, in 2010 there were almost 2.3 billion worldwide.
But the same publication also indicates that those Christians belong to over 41,000 denominations ​ — each with its own doctrines and rules of conduct.
Faced with this bewildering array of “Christian ” religions, it is understandable that some observers become confused or even disillusioned.
They may wonder, ‘ Are all who claim to be Christians really Christian? ’
A traveler is usually required to state his citizenship to a border official.
He also needs to prove that he is who he claims to be by producing some identification, perhaps a passport.
Similarly, a true Christian needs to do more than profess his faith in Christ.
He needs to have additional identification.
The term “Christian ” first came into use sometime after 44 C.E.
The Bible historian Luke reported: “It was first in Antioch that the disciples were by divine providence called Christians. ”
Note that those called Christians were Christ’s disciples.
What makes a person a disciple of Jesus Christ?
The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology explains: “Following Jesus as a disciple means the unconditional sacrifice of [one’s] whole life... for the whole of his life. ”
A true Christian, therefore, is one who follows the teachings and instructions of Jesus, the Founder of Christianity, totally and unconditionally.
Is it possible to find such people among the many who profess to be Christians today?
What did Jesus himself say would identify his true followers?
We invite you to consider how the Bible answers these questions.
In the following articles, we will examine five statements by Jesus that characterize and help to identify his true followers.
We will consider how the first - century Christians measured up. And we will endeavor to see who among the many professing to be Christians today fit the pattern.
“Remain in My Word ”
“If you remain in my word, you are really my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. ” ​ — JOHN 8: 31, 32.
What It Means: Jesus ’ “word ” means his teachings, which came from a higher source.
“The Father himself who sent me has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak, ” said Jesus.
In prayer to his heavenly Father, Jehovah God, Jesus said: “Your word is truth. ”
He frequently quoted God’s Word to support his teachings.
True Christians, therefore, ‘ remain in his word ’ ​ — that is, they accept God’s Word, the Bible, as “truth ” and the ultimate authority for their beliefs and practices.
How Early Christians Measured Up: The most prolific Christian Bible writer, the apostle Paul, shared Jesus ’ respect for God’s Word.
He wrote: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial. ”
Men appointed to teach fellow Christians had to “hold fast to the sure and trustworthy Word of God. ”
Early Christians were admonished to reject “the philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ. ” ​ — Colossians 2: 8.
Who Fit the Pattern Today?: According to the Vatican’s Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation, adopted in 1965 and quoted in the Catechism of the Catholic Church: “It is not from Sacred Scripture alone that the [Catholic] Church draws her certainty about everything which has been revealed.
Therefore both sacred tradition and Sacred Scripture are to be accepted and venerated with the same sense of loyalty and reverence. ”
An article in Maclean’s magazine quoted a minister in Toronto, Canada, who asked: “Why do we need a ‘ revolutionary ’ voice from two millennia ago to guide us?
We have fabulous ideas of our own, that are constantly weakened by having to tie them back to Jesus and Scripture. ”
Regarding Jehovah’s Witnesses, the New Catholic Encyclopedia states: “They regard the Bible as their only source of belief and rule of conduct. ”
Recently, a man in Canada interrupted one of Jehovah’s Witnesses as she was introducing herself.
“I know who you are, ” he said, pointing at her Bible,“ by your signature. ”
“No Part of the World ”
“The world has hated them, because they are no part of the world. ” ​ — JOHN 17: 14.
What It Means: Being no part of the world, Jesus was neutral in the social and political conflicts of the day.
“If my kingdom were part of this world, ” he explained,“ my attendants would have fought that I should not be delivered up to the Jews.
But, as it is, my kingdom is not from this source. ”
He also urged his followers to shun attitudes, speech, and conduct condemned in God’s Word. ​ — Matthew 20: 25 - 27.
How Early Christians Measured Up: According to religion writer Jonathan Dymond, the early Christians “refused to engage in [war]; whatever were the consequences, whether reproach, or imprisonment, or death. ”
They chose to suffer rather than compromise their neutral stand.
Their moral code also set them apart.
Christians were told: “Because you do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you. ”
Historian Will Durant wrote that Christians “were troubling the pleasure - mad pagan world with their piety and their decency. ”
Who Fit the Pattern Today?
Regarding Christian neutrality, the New Catholic Encyclopedia asserts: “Conscientious objection is morally indefensible. ”
An article in the Reformierte Presse states that a report by African Rights, a human rights organization, on the 1994 Rwandan genocide established the participation of all churches, “with the exception of Jehovah’s Witnesses. ”
Discussing the Nazi Holocaust, a high - school teacher lamented that “no group or organization of regular citizens spoke out against the mass of lies, cruelty, and eventual atrocities. ”
After consulting with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, he wrote: “I now had my answer. ”
He learned that Jehovah’s Witnesses stood firm in their beliefs in spite of the harsh treatment they received.
What about their moral code?
“The majority of today’s young adult Catholics disagree with church teachings on issues like cohabitation [and] premarital sex, ” says U.S. Catholic magazine.
The journal quotes a church deacon, who said: “A great percentage I see ​ — I’d guess it’s well over 50 percent — ​ are already living together when they come to be married. ”
The New Encyclopædia Britannica observes that Jehovah’s Witnesses “insist upon a high moral code in personal conduct. ”
“Have Love Among Yourselves ”
“I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves. ” ​ — JOHN 13: 34, 35.
What It Means: Christ told his followers to love one another the way that he loved them.
How did Jesus love them?
His love transcended the national and gender bias prevalent in his day.
Love moved Jesus to sacrifice his time, energy, and personal comfort in order to help others.
Finally, Christ showed love in the greatest way possible.
“I am the fine shepherd, ” he said.
“The fine shepherd surrenders his soul in behalf of the sheep. ” ​ — John 10: 11.
How Early Christians Measured Up: In the first century, Christians called each other “brother ” or“ sister. ”
People of all nations were welcomed into the Christian congregation, for they believed that “there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for there is the same Lord over all. ”
After Pentecost 33 C.E., the disciples in Jerusalem “went selling their possessions and properties and distributing the proceeds to all, just as anyone would have the need. ”
For what purpose?
So that those newly baptized could remain in Jerusalem and continue “devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles. ”
What motivated such actions? Less than 200 years after the death of the apostles, Tertullian quoted what others said of Christians: “How they love one another... and how they are ready even to die for one another. ”
Who Fit the Pattern Today?
The book The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1837) observed that over the centuries those who professed to be Christians “have inflicted far greater severities on each other, than they had experienced from the zeal of infidels [unbelievers]. ”
A recent U.S. study found a strong link between religious people ​ — most of whom identified themselves as Christian — ​ and racial bias.
Churchgoers in one land are often unaffiliated with those of the same denomination in another land and are thus unable or disinclined to help fellow believers when a need arises.
In 2004, after Florida was hit by a string of four hurricanes in two months, the chairman of Florida’s Emergency Operations Committee checked to ensure that their supplies were being used properly.
He said that no other group was as well organized as Jehovah’s Witnesses, and he offered to provide any supplies needed by the Witnesses.
Earlier, in 1997, a relief team of Jehovah’s Witnesses with medicine, food, and clothing traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo to assist their Christian brothers and others in need.
Fellow Witnesses in Europe had donated supplies totaling a million dollars (U.S.).
“I Have Made Your Name Known ”
“I have made your name manifest to the men you gave me out of the world....
I have made your name known to them and will make it known. ” ​ — JOHN 17: 6, 26.
What It Means: Jesus made known God’s name by using it in his ministry.
When Jesus read from the Scriptures, as he often did, he would have pronounced God’s personal name.
He taught his followers to pray: “Father, let your name be sanctified. ” ​ — Luke 11: 2.
How Early Christians Measured Up: The apostle Peter related to the older men at Jerusalem that God had taken out of the nations “a people for his name. ”
The apostles and others preached that “everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved. ”
They also used the divine name in their own writings.
The Tosefta, a collection of Jewish laws completed by about 300 C.E., says regarding the burning of Christian writings by opposers: “The books of the Evangelists and the books of the minim [thought to be Jewish Christians] they do not save from a fire.
But they are allowed to burn where they are,... they and the references to the Divine Name which are in them. ”
Who Fit the Pattern Today?
The Revised Standard Version of the Bible, authorized by the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the United States, says in its preface: “The use of any proper name for the one and only God, as though there were other gods from whom he had to be distinguished, was discontinued in Judaism before the Christian era and is entirely inappropriate for the universal faith of the Christian Church. ”
Thus, it replaced the divine name with a title, “LORD. ”
More recently, the Vatican directed its bishops: “In songs and prayers the name of God in the form of the tetragrammaton YHWH * is neither to be used or pronounced. ”
Who today use and make known God’s personal name?
When Sergey was a teenager in Kyrgyzstan, he watched a film that identified God’s name as Jehovah.
For some ten years, he did not hear the divine name again.
Later, after Sergey had moved to the United States, two of Jehovah’s Witnesses visited him at his home and showed him God’s name in the Bible.
Sergey was thrilled to find a group that used the name Jehovah.
Interestingly, under the entry “Jehovah God, ” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary gives the definition“ a supreme deity recognized and the only deity worshiped by Jehovah’s Witnesses. ”
In English, the divine name is commonly transliterated as “Jehovah. ”
“This Good News of the Kingdom Will Be Preached ”
“This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come. ” ​ — MATTHEW 24: 14.
What It Means: The Gospel writer Luke reported that Jesus “went journeying from city to city and from village to village, preaching and declaring the good news of the kingdom of God. ”
Jesus himself said: “I must declare the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this I was sent forth. ”
He sent his disciples to preach the good news in the towns and villages and later commanded them: “You will be witnesses of me... to the most distant part of the earth. ” ​ — Acts 1: 8; Luke 10: 1.
How Early Christians Measured Up: Jesus ’ disciples wasted no time in doing what Jesus told them.
“Every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ. ”
Preaching was not limited to an elite group.
Historian Neander observed that “Celsus, the first writer against Christianity, jeer [ed] at the fact, that wool - workers, cobblers, leather - dressers, the most illiterate and vulgar of mankind, were zealous preachers of the gospel. ”
In his book The Early Centuries of the Church, Jean Bernardi wrote: “[Christians] were to go out and speak everywhere and to everyone.
On the highways and in the cities, on the public squares and in the homes. Welcome or unwelcome....
To the ends of the earth. ” Who Fit the Pattern Today?
“The church’s failure to take preaching and teaching seriously is one reason for the general spiritual malaise of today, ” writes Anglican priest David Watson.
In his book Why Are the Catholics Leaving?
José Luis Pérez Guadalupe wrote about the activities of Evangelicals, Adventists, and others and observed that “they do not go from house to house. ”
Regarding Jehovah’s Witnesses, he wrote: “They go systematically from house to house. ”
An interesting and realistic observation made by Jonathan Turley is found in Cato Supreme Court Review, 2001 - 2002: “Mention the Jehovah’s Witnesses, and most people immediately think of preachers visiting our homes at inconvenient hours.
For the Jehovah’s Witnesses, proselytizing door - to - door is not simply to advance their faith but the very article of faith. ”

Do You Recognize the Mark?
Based on the Scriptural criteria discussed in this series of articles, who today, do you think, bear the mark of true Christianity?
Though there are tens of thousands of groups and denominations claiming to be Christian, bear in mind what Jesus told his followers: “Not everyone saying to me, ‘ Lord, Lord, ’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will. ”
Identifying those who are doing the will of the Father ​ — thus bearing the mark of true Christianity — ​ and associating with them can lead to eternal blessings under God’s Kingdom.
We invite you to ask Jehovah’s Witnesses, who brought you this magazine, for more information about God’s Kingdom and the blessings it will bring. ​ — Luke 4: 43.
Learn From God’s Word
This article considers questions you may have raised and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible.
Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.
How should Jesus ’ death be remembered?
Jesus told his followers to remember his death by means of a symbolic meal, using bread and wine.
The bread represents Jesus ’ body, and the wine his blood. ​ — Read Luke 22: 19, 20.
The bread that Jesus used was unleavened, or without yeast.
In the Bible, yeast is often used to represent sin.
So the bread was a fitting symbol of Jesus ’ perfect body.
He offered his body as a sacrifice, which did away with the animal sacrifices under the Mosaic Law.
The wine was a symbol of Jesus ’ precious blood that was poured out as a sacrifice for our sins. ​ — Read 1 Peter 1: 19; 2: 24; 3: 18.
When should we commemorate Jesus ’ death?
Jesus ’ death occurred on Passover, Nisan 14.
A Jewish day begins at sundown.
The evening before he died, Jesus ate the Passover meal with his apostles and then instituted a new memorial meal to commemorate his death. ​ — Read Luke 22: 14, 15.
Today, God’s people commemorate what God provided through Jesus to set the whole world free from sin and death.
Just as the Passover was observed once a year, so the Memorial of Jesus ’ death is held once a year after sundown on Nisan 14 according to the Bible’s lunar calendar. ​ — Read John 1: 29.
Who should partake of the bread and the wine?
When Jesus handed the wine to his followers, he said: “This cup means the new covenant. ”
The new covenant replaced the Mosaic Law covenant, in which God had promised the Israelites that if they strictly obeyed him, they would become his people.
However, Israel did not obey God’s voice.
So Jehovah provided a new covenant. ​ — Read Jeremiah 31: 31.
Through the new covenant, Jehovah makes blessings available to many by means of a few.
Those in the covenant are few, a mere 144,000.
Through them, millions from all nations will be blessed with everlasting life in an earthly paradise.
Some who are in the new covenant serve Jehovah on earth today.
They alone properly partake of the bread and the wine because the cup “means the new covenant. ” ​ — Read Luke 12: 32; Revelation 14: 1, 3.
How does the Memorial benefit us?
The annual Memorial of Jesus ’ death deepens our appreciation for Jehovah’s extraordinary love.
He sent his Son to die for our sins.
So when we attend the Memorial, we should contemplate what Jesus ’ death means for us.
We should consider how we can show appreciation for what Jehovah and Jesus have done for us. ​ — Read John 3: 16; 2 Corinthians 5: 14, 15.
For more information, see pages 206 - 208 of this book, What Does the Bible Really Teach?, published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.
What Is Wrong With Spiritism?
From youth, Barbara * saw visions, heard voices, and was convinced that she had contacts with deceased relatives.
She and her husband, Joachim, read books on the occult and became proficient in reading tarot cards.
These indicated that they would earn big money, which they did in business.
One day, the cards warned them that dangerous people would come to their home and told them how they should defend themselves.
ALTHOUGH belief in the occult may seem antiquated, interest in the paranormal is widespread.
People worldwide wear amulets, use Ouija boards, and consult spirit mediums to tell their fortune or to protect themselves from evil.
In an article entitled “Laptop and Lucifer, ” the German magazine Focus remarked:“ The Internet is giving the witchcraft scene new impetus. ”
Did you know that the Bible speaks about spiritism?
What it says on the subject might surprise you.
What the Bible Says About Spiritism
The law that God gave his people in ancient Israel stated: “There should not be found in you... anyone who employs divination, a practicer of magic or anyone who looks for omens or a sorcerer, or one who binds others with a spell or anyone who consults a spirit medium or a professional foreteller of events or anyone who inquires of the dead.
For everybody doing these things is something detestable to Jehovah. ”
Why such a strong stand against spiritistic practices?
As our opening experience shows, many believe that the living can communicate with the dead and that information obtained through occult practices originates with the dead.
Such beliefs are rooted in what is taught by many religions ​ — that at death humans live on in the spirit realm.
But, contrary to this teaching, the Bible clearly states: “As for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all. ”
It describes the dead as if they were in a deep sleep, totally unaware of what is taking place around them.
* That being the case, you might ask, How are we to explain experiences that people have with the paranormal?
What is the source of such communication?
Communication With the Spirit World
The Gospel accounts show that when on earth, Jesus had dealings with the spirit world.
Mark 1: 23, 24 reports that “an unclean spirit ” told Jesus:“ I know exactly who you are. ”
The spirits undoubtedly know who you are too.
But do you know who they are?
Before God created humans, he created multitudes of spirit sons, or angels.
The angels are of a life - form higher than humans.
They are powerful and highly intelligent, and they were created to do God’s will.
The psalmist sang: “Bless Jehovah, O you angels of his, mighty in power, carrying out his word. ” ​ — Psalm 103: 20.
The Bible reveals that in time some of the angels initiated unauthorized contact with humans.
For what purpose?
The first one to do so used deception to lead the first humans, Adam and Eve, away from their God and Creator.
In so doing, he turned himself into Satan the Devil, a slanderer and opposer of God. ​ — Genesis 3: 1 - 6.
Later, other angels “forsook their own proper dwelling place ” in heaven, took on human bodies, and began living with attractive women on earth.
Those renegade angels and their hybrid offspring terrorized humankind, so much so that the earth became “filled with violence. ”
You are probably familiar with the Bible account of how God put an end to that violent and wicked generation by the Flood in Noah’s day. ​ — Genesis 6: 3, 4, 11 - 13.
The floodwaters forced the spirits to dematerialize and return to the spirit realm.
But the Creator did not allow them to return to their original “dwelling place. ”
Instead, they were confined to a debased condition compared to “pits of dense darkness. ”
The Bible refers to rebel angels as “demons. ” They are the power behind spiritism.
What the Demons Want
The objective of the wicked spirits who communicate with humans is first to divert them from worshipping the true God, Jehovah.
The gifts or powers that many practicers of the occult claim to have are nothing more than distractions to keep people from gaining accurate knowledge about God and building a relationship with him.
The demons ’ second objective can be seen in what Satan, their leader, attempted with Jesus. Satan offered Jesus “all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. ”
What did Satan want in return?
Yes, Satan and the demons desire to be worshipped.
But Jesus rejected the idea of forsaking God and true worship. ​ — Matthew 4: 8 - 10.
Evil spirits seldom make such direct offers today. Rather, they seek to ensnare the unwary with seemingly harmless means of diversion, such as crystal balls, tea leaves, tarot cards, pendulums, and horoscopes.
Do not be deceived by such practices!
They are not doorways to the unknown by means of some mysterious force of nature.
Wicked spirits use fascination with the occult to lure and ensnare people with the aim of diverting them from worshipping Jehovah.
When that does not achieve their goal, evil spirits often harass and make miserable those who become entangled in their web.
If that has been true in your case, what can you do to free yourself from their influence?
Spiritism ​ — How to Escape
Make no mistake about it, spirits who communicate with humans are enemies of God, doomed for destruction.
They are impostors and liars, who pose as the dead.
How would you feel if you found that a supposed friend was an impostor, interested only in diverting you from your best interests?
How would you react if you discovered that you had unknowingly entered into a relationship with a sexual predator on the Internet?
Entanglement with the demons is far more dangerous.
You need to do all you can to break off the contact.
What can you do?
After learning what the Scriptures teach about spiritism, some inhabitants of ancient Ephesus saw the need to destroy their books on magical arts, costly though they were.
They “burned them up before everybody. ”
Today objects related to the occult include not only books, amulets, Ouija boards, and the like but also material from electronic sources.
Turn away from anything that seems like a gateway to spiritism.
Recall the couple mentioned at the beginning of this article.
From their tarot cards, they concluded that dangerous people would come to their home but that they should neither listen to nor accept anything from them.
However, when Connie and Gudrun, two of Jehovah’s Witnesses, appeared at their door saying that they brought good news about God, Joachim and Barbara decided that they would listen.
Their conversation came to the subject of spiritism, and Connie and Gudrun provided accurate information about it from the Scriptures.
A regular Bible discussion began.
Soon Joachim and Barbara decided to break off all contacts with the demons.
The Witnesses explained that the spirits would likely not be happy about that.
In fact, Joachim and Barbara went through difficult times and suffered frightening demon attacks.
For a while, they were in fear every night until moving into another house brought some relief.
Throughout their ordeal, this couple maintained confidence in the words of Philippians 4: 13: “For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me. ”
Jehovah blessed their determination, and the spirits eventually stopped harassing them.
Today Joachim and Barbara are happy worshippers of the true God, Jehovah.
The Scriptures urge all who would have Jehovah’s blessing: “Subject yourselves... to God; but oppose the Devil, and he will flee from you.
Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you. ”
Jehovah God can and will help you to get free from demon influence, if you want to.
Looking back on their liberation from spiritism, Joachim and Barbara wholeheartedly agree with the words of Psalm 121: 2: “My help is from Jehovah. ”
The names have been changed.
For a detailed discussion of the condition of the dead, see chapter 6, “Where Are the Dead?, ” in the book What Does the Bible Really Teach?
published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.

KINGDOM HALL CONSTRUCTION
1,031 since 1998
As told by Lois Didur
How often in your life have you said something like this, ‘ I wish I had not made the choice I did ’? Well, after 50 years in full - time service, I cannot think of anything lastingly unpleasant that has come from being at Jehovah’s right hand.
Let me tell you why.
I WAS born in 1939 and grew up in rural Saskatchewan, Canada, along with four sisters and a brother.
Life on the prairie farm was happy.
One day, Jehovah’s Witnesses called on my father, and I asked them if God has a name.
They showed us the name Jehovah at Psalm 83: 18.
That made me want to know more about God and his Word. In those years, farm children went to one - room rural schools up to the eighth grade.
They rode horses or walked the many miles to school.
The schoolteacher’s needs were provided for by families in the district.
One year, it was my parents ’ turn to accommodate the new teacher, John Didur.
Unknown to me, this young man too had a keen interest in God’s Word.
Once I was praising communism and socialism, which my father then advocated. John quietly replied: “No man has the right to rule over other men.
Only God has that right. ”
Having been born in 1931, John had heard of the hardships of war.
When the Korean War erupted in 1950, he questioned various churchmen about their involvement in war. All said that it was acceptable for Christians to take up arms.
Later, he asked Jehovah’s Witnesses the same question.
They directed him to the Scriptural stand toward war that the early Christians took.
John was baptized in 1955. The following year, I was too.
We both knew that we wanted to serve Jehovah with our life and energy.
In July 1957, John and I were married.
Many a year on our wedding anniversary, we were at a convention.
We were glad to be in the company of thousands of others who respected marriage. Our first international convention was in 1958.
Five of us set off for New York City by car from Saskatchewan.
For a week, we drove by day, and each night we slept in a tent.
Imagine our surprise when a brother we met in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, invited us to stay at his family home that night!
His spontaneous kindness allowed us to arrive in New York City clean and tidy.
That huge convention impressed on us the outstanding pleasure of serving Jehovah!
As the psalmist wrote, “there is pleasantness at your right hand forever. ” ​ — Ps.
16: 11.
A year later, in 1959, we were pioneering and living in a small house trailer on top of a prairie hill in Saskatchewan.
You could see for miles, and some of these miles were our territory.
One day, an interesting letter from the branch office arrived.
I hurried out to where John was working on the tractor.
The letter invited us to be special pioneers in Red Lake, Ontario.
Not knowing where that was, we quickly got out maps to find it.
What a contrast it proved to be to the open prairies!
Now we experienced huge forests and little towns built near gold mines.
As we were looking for accommodations the first day, a little girl heard our conversation with her neighbor.
She ran home to her mother, who kindly offered us lodging overnight.
The bed was in a dirt cellar.
The next day, we located a place, a two - room log house with no plumbing and no furniture, just a wood - burning tin heater.
We got a few things at a secondhand shop and soon felt quite content.
There was no congregation within 130 miles (209 km).
Many workers in the gold mines had come from Europe, and they asked if we could get them a Bible in their language.
In a short time, we had 30 excellent Bible studies.
Within six months, a small congregation was formed. The husband of one woman with whom we studied phoned his priest to come and set his wife straight.
During the encounter, the priest said that we should be teaching the Trinity, among other things.
The woman got their Catholic Bible and asked the priest to back up the things he was saying.
He flung the Bible across the table, saying that he did not need to prove anything.
As he left, he said in Ukrainian that they should throw us out of the house and never let us in again.
He did not realize that John understood Ukrainian!
Shortly thereafter, we left Red Lake because John was to be trained for the circuit work.
About a year later, however, when John was giving the baptism talk at a district convention, that husband was among the baptismal candidates!
The episode with the priest had caused him to begin looking into the Bible for himself.
BUSY IN THE TRAVELING WORK
In the circuit work, we had the unique pleasure of staying with many different families.
We became very close to those who shared their home and life with us.
Once, we were in an upstairs room that had no heat in the winter.
Early in the morning, we would hear the elderly sister quietly enter our room to light a fire in the tiny stove.
Soon, she would return with a basin and warm water so that we could prepare for the day.
I learned much from her quiet, gentle ways.
The traveling work helped me to draw closer to Jehovah.
One circuit in Alberta included a mining town in the Far North, where a sister lived.
How did Jehovah’s organization view that isolated sister?
Every six months, we flew there to spend a week in service and to hold meetings with her, just as with a large city congregation.
It was a warm reminder of Jehovah’s tender care for each little sheeplike one.
We kept in touch with many who provided accommodations for us.
That reminds me of one of the first gifts John gave me ​ — a colorful box full of writing paper.
We thoroughly enjoyed keeping in touch with friends by mail, using such writing material. I still treasure that letter box.
While we were in a circuit in Toronto, a brother from the Canada Bethel phoned to ask if we would consider coming to Bethel.
When did he want the answer? “Tomorrow if possible! ” He got it.
BETHEL SERVICE
Each change of assignment had shown us various aspects of the pleasantness that comes at Jehovah’s hand.
That continued when we moved to Bethel in 1977.
Association with some of the anointed ones allowed us to see not only their different personalities but also their high regard for God’s Word.
The new routine at Bethel felt good.
For example, our clothes were now in a drawer rather than in a suitcase, and we belonged to one congregation.
Besides working at my assignment, taking visiting groups on tour was always a happy experience for me.
I would explain the work being done at Bethel, hear the comments of the visiting brothers, and answer their questions.
Years passed quickly, and in 1997, John was invited to attend the School for Branch Committee Members at Patterson, New York.
Thereafter, we were asked if we would consider moving to Ukraine. We were encouraged to think it over carefully and prayerfully.
By the end of that evening, we knew that our answer would be yes.
ANOTHER CHANGE ​ — UKRAINE
We had attended the large international convention in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1992, and then the one in Kiev, Ukraine, in 1993.
Those had attracted us to our brothers in Eastern Europe.
Our new accommodations in Lviv, Ukraine, were on the second floor of an old home.
The windows overlooked a yard that had a little garden, a big red rooster, and a brood of hens.
It felt almost like being on a Saskatchewan farm.
Twelve of us lived in that home. We had an early morning ride across the city each day to work at Bethel.
How did we feel about being in Ukraine?
It was humbling to sit among many who had gone through trials, bans, and imprisonments.
Yet, they had kept their faith strong. When we commended them, they would say, “We did it for Jehovah. ”
They never felt that they were left on their own.
Even now, if you thank someone for a kindness, he or she may reply, “Thank Jehovah, ” acknowledging the Source of all good things.
In Ukraine, many walk to the meetings, so they have time to talk and encourage one another.
The walk might be an hour or more.
There are over 50 congregations in Lviv, 21 of which use a big Kingdom Hall complex.
On Sundays, it is a very beautiful sight to see a steady flow of brothers coming to the meetings.
We quickly felt at ease with the brothers and sisters, who have a gentle manner and are eager to care for others.
When I have a problem understanding the language, which I still do, they are very patient.
Their eyes often express as much as their words.
An example of the real trust among our brothers came during the 2003 international convention in Kiev.
We had just gone down to the platform of the busy underground metro system when a young girl walked over to us and quietly said, “I’m lost. I can’t find my grandma. ”
The girl had seen our badge cards and knew that we were Witnesses. She was so brave and did not cry.
A circuit overseer’s wife who was with us gently took the girl to the Lost and Found Department at the stadium. Soon the girl was reunited with her grandma.
I was very touched by the wonderful trust that this little girl had, even in a crowd of thousands of people.
Brothers from many countries came to Ukraine in May 2001 for the dedication of our new branch facilities.
After the special talk at a stadium on Sunday morning, a sea of brothers came walking up the road to tour the new Bethel.
What an unforgettable sight!
I was quite moved to see these brothers, who were so quiet and orderly.
It deepened my appreciation for the pleasantness that comes with serving God.
A DRASTIC CHANGE
Sadly, in 2004, John was diagnosed with cancer. We went to Canada for his treatment.
The first session of chemotherapy was almost too much for his system, and he spent some weeks in intensive care.
Thankfully, he regained consciousness. Though he could hardly speak, his eyes always showed appreciation for all who visited him.
But he was not able to recover, and he died that fall.
I felt that a very big part of me was missing. John and I had so enjoyed serving Jehovah together.
What would I do?
I chose to return to Ukraine. I have been very grateful for the warm love of the Bethel family and of the congregation there.
There was never a time in our life that we regretted the choices we had made.
It has been a pleasant life, with the best of association.
I know that there is still much to learn about Jehovah’s goodness, and I do hope to continue in his service forever because I truly have found ‘ pleasantness at Jehovah’s right hand. ’

Have you ever been asked to give advice to others?
For example, have you ever been asked such questions as: ‘ What should I do? Should I go to this gathering? pursue this career? associate with this person with a view to marriage? ’
Sincere people may ask you for help in making decisions ​ — decisions that may influence their relationship with friends, family, or even Jehovah.
On what will you base your reply?
What is your custom in giving advice to others?
Whether the topic appears trivial or weighty, “the heart of the righteous one meditates so as to answer, ” says Proverbs 15: 28.
Consider how the following five Bible principles can help as to giving advice.
1 Discern the Real Situation.
“When anyone is replying to a matter before he hears it, that is foolishness on his part and a humiliation. ” ​ — PROV.
18: 13.
In order to give good advice, we must understand the circumstances and viewpoint of the one seeking assistance.
To illustrate: If someone called you and asked for the best way to get to your home, what would you need to know in order to help?
Could you advise him of the best route to take without first knowing his present location?
Of course not!
Likewise, providing proper guidance requires discerning the present “location ” ​ — the circumstances and viewpoint — ​ of the one seeking direction.
Could there be extenuating circumstances that might affect our response?
Without proper knowledge of a situation, we might give advice that causes a person to become even more confused. ​ — Luke 6: 39.
Determine How Much Research He Has Done.
It may also be wise to ask the person seeking advice such questions as: “What Bible principles do you think apply? ”
“What are the apparent advantages and disadvantages of the options before you? ”
“What research have you already done? ”
“What help have others, such as the congregation elders, your parents, or your Bible study conductor, already provided for you? ”
The answers may help us to discern how much effort the person has already put into finding an answer. Also, our counsel will take into account what others may already have said.
We may also discern whether the person is basically seeking a counselor who will ‘ tickle his ears ’ with the advice he wants to hear. ​ — 2 Tim.
4: 3. 2 Avoid Hasty Responses.
“Every man must be swift about hearing, slow about speaking. ” ​ — JAS. 1: 19.
With good intentions, we may respond quickly. But would that usually be wise, especially if we are discussing a topic we have not thoroughly researched?
Proverbs 29: 20 says: “Have you beheld a man hasty with his words?
There is more hope for someone stupid than for him. ”
Take the time to make sure that your approach is in full harmony with godly wisdom.
Ask yourself, ‘ Have the thinking and “spirit of the world ” worked their way into my thinking? ’
Remember that good intentions alone may not be enough.
The apostle Peter, after he learned of Jesus ’ difficult assignment, advised Jesus: “Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this destiny at all. ”
What can we learn from Peter’s reaction? That if not careful, even a sincere person could promote, “not God’s thoughts, but those of men. ”
How important to think before we speak!
After all, is not our own experience severely limited when compared with God’s wisdom? ​ — Job 38: 1 - 4; Prov.
11: 2.
3 Humbly Apply God’s Word.
“I do nothing of my own initiative; but just as the Father taught me I speak these things. ” ​ — JOHN 8: 28.
Will you say, “If I were you, I would... ”?
Even if the answer to the inquiry seems obvious, you would do well to learn from the pattern of humility and modesty that Jesus left.
He had far greater wisdom and experience than any other human; yet, he said: “I have not spoken out of my own impulse, but the Father himself... has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak. ”
Jesus ’ teachings and advice were always based on his Father’s will.
For example, we read at Luke 22: 49 that Jesus ’ disciples asked for direction on whether they should fight when he was about to be arrested.
One disciple used a sword.
Notice from the parallel account at Matthew 26: 52 - 54 that even under those circumstances, Jesus took time to reason with the disciple on Jehovah’s will.
Aware of the principles found at Genesis 9: 6 and the prophecies of Psalm 22 and Isaiah 53, Jesus was able to give wise direction that no doubt saved lives and pleased Jehovah.
4 Use Your Theocratic Library.
“Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics, to give them their food at the proper time? ” ​ — MATT.
24: 45. Jesus has appointed a trusted slave class that dispenses vital spiritual food.
When you are giving advice and direction regarding important matters, do you take time to do thorough research in Bible - based publications?
The Watch Tower Publications Index and the Watchtower Library * place abundant and clear information at our fingertips.
What a mistake it would be to overlook this wealth of information!
Thousands of topics are cited, with many articles to help someone seeking advice. How skilled are you at helping others investigate Bible principles and reason on God’s Word?
Just as a GPS can help a person identify where he is and guide him to his destination, so research tools can help him see the road he is on and discern how to remain on the path to life.
Many elders have trained publishers to look up articles by using the Index or the Watchtower Library, thus assisting their brothers and sisters to reason on the Scriptures.
Such assistance helps publishers not only to address their immediate concerns but also to develop a habit of doing research and relying on Jehovah’s spiritual provisions. In this way, they “have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong. ” ​ — Heb. 5: 14.
5 Avoid Trying to Make Decisions for Others.
“Each one will carry his own load. ” ​ — GAL. 6: 5.
In the end, each person needs to choose for himself which counsel and advice to follow.
Jehovah allows all of us the freedom to decide whether we will be governed by his principles or not.
Some situations involve several Bible principles, and ultimately, the person seeking advice has to make his own decision.
Based on the issue or the age of the one seeking our advice, we may also need to ask ourselves, ‘ Do I really have the authority to address this question? ’
Some matters are best referred to congregation elders or if the inquirer is a young person, to his parents.
The Watchtower Library on CD - ROM is currently available in 39 languages.
The Watch Tower Publications Index is currently available in over 45 languages.
[Box / ​ Picture on page 8]
As a study project, why not do research to find answers to questions that have been posed to you recently?
What articles and Bible principles can you locate that could assist someone asking such questions?
For instance, suppose a brother or a sister asks you about dating someone with marriage in view.
When using the Index or the Watchtower Library, look up the most directly related subject first.
For example, in the Index you might look up “Dating ” or“ Marriage. ” Then scan the subtopics for relevant articles.
When viewing a main heading, note whether there are any “See also ” topics, which may point to a heading more directly related to your search.
[Box on page 9]
Thanks to Jehovah’s provisions through his organization, we can both give and receive the best advice.
Ecclesiastes 12: 11 states: “The words of the wise ones are like oxgoads, and just like nails driven in are those indulging in collections of sentences; they have been given from one shepherd. ”
Just like “oxgoads ” ​ — pointed sticks used to guide draft animals — ​ loving and sound advice guides sincere ones in the right direction.
“Nails driven in ” produce stable structures.
Similarly, sharing good advice can produce stable results.
Wise ones ‘ indulge, ’ or find unrestrained delight, in considering “collections of sentences ” that reflect the wisdom of their“ one shepherd, ” Jehovah.
Echo the Shepherd when giving advice.
What a privilege to provide a listening ear along with helpful counsel whenever we can!
When truly based on Bible principles, our advice will prove to be sound and may contribute to the everlasting good of the listener.
Help People to “Awake From Sleep ”
“You people know the season, that it is already the hour for you to awake from sleep. ” ​ — ROM. 13: 11.
Why is it vital that Christians stay awake spiritually?
Why should wakeful ministers listen and be observant?
What role do kindness and gentleness play in our ministry?
1, 2.
In what sense do many people need to wake up?
EVERY year, thousands die because they get drowsy or even fall asleep while driving a motor vehicle.
Others lose their jobs because they do not wake up in time to go to work or because they fall asleep on the job.
But spiritual drowsiness can have far more serious effects.
It is in this important context that the Bible says: “Happy is the one that stays awake. ” ​ — Rev.
16: 14 - 16. As Jehovah’s great day approaches, mankind in general is sleeping in a spiritual sense.
Even some of Christendom’s leaders have referred to their flocks as ‘ sleeping giants. ’
What is spiritual sleep?
Why is it vital that true Christians keep awake?
How can we help others to awake from such sleep?
SPIRITUAL SLEEP ​ — WHAT IS IT?
How would you describe a person who is not spiritually awake?
People who sleep are usually inactive.
In contrast, those who sleep spiritually may be very busy ​ — but not with spiritual matters.
They may be frantically occupied with the daily anxieties of life or seeking pleasure, prestige, or wealth.
With all this activity, they show little concern for their spiritual needs.
People who are spiritually awake, though, realize that we live “in the last days, ” so they are as active as possible in doing God’s will. ​ — 2 Pet.
3: 3, 4; Luke 21: 34 - 36. What is the import of the counsel: “Let us not sleep on as the rest do ”?
Read 1 Thessalonians 5: 4 - 8.
Here the apostle Paul exhorts fellow believers not to “sleep on as the rest do. ” What did he mean?
One way we can “sleep on ” is by ignoring Jehovah’s moral standards.
Another way we can “sleep on ” is by ignoring the fact that Jehovah’s time to destroy the ungodly has approached.
We must make sure that such ungodly individuals do not influence us to adopt their ways and attitudes.
What types of attitudes characterize those who are spiritually asleep?
Some people imagine that there is no God who will call them to account.
Others imagine that God is not interested in us humans, so there is no point in our being interested in him.
Still others feel that belonging to a church will make them friends of God.
All these people are spiritually asleep. They need to wake up.
How can we help them?
WE MUST KEEP AWAKE OURSELVES
Why must Christians strive to stay spiritually awake?
To be in a position to awaken others, we must be awake ourselves.
What does that involve?
God’s Word associates figurative sleep with “works belonging to darkness ” ​ — revelries, drunken bouts, illicit intercourse, loose conduct, strife, and jealousy. (Read Romans 13: 11 - 14.)
Avoiding such conduct can be challenging.
Vigilance is vital. A car driver who underestimates the danger of falling asleep behind the wheel may be risking his life.
How important it is for a Christian to be aware that spiritual slumber can be deadly!
How might a mistaken view of people affect us?
For example, a Christian might imagine that all in his territory have irrevocably rejected the good news.
He might reason, ‘ If no one is going to respond, why be energetic in trying to reach or help people? ’
Granted, many might now be sleeping spiritually, but their circumstances and attitudes could change.
Some do wake up and respond.
And we can help them if we ourselves keep awake, such as by trying new ways to present the Kingdom message in an appealing manner.
Part of our staying awake involves reminding ourselves why our ministry is vital.
WHAT MAKES OUR MINISTRY VITAL?
Why is our Christian ministry vitally important?
Bear in mind that whatever the current response, our preaching honors Jehovah and plays a role in the outworking of his purpose.
Soon, those who do not obey the good news will undergo judicial punishment.
The way people react to our preaching will be a basis for judgment.
Furthermore, it would be a mistake for a Christian to reason that vigorous preaching is unnecessary because “there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. ”
We understand from God’s Word that those who are judged as “goats ” will go“ into everlasting cutting - off. ”
Our preaching expresses God’s mercy, opening the way for people to change and to get “everlasting life. ”
If we did not preach, how would people have the opportunity to hear the message that can mean life?
How has sharing in preaching the good news benefited both you and others?
Preaching the good news also benefits us. (Read 1 Timothy 4: 16.)
Have you not found that speaking about Jehovah and the Kingdom hope strengthens your faith and your love for God?
Has it not helped you to develop Christian qualities?
Does not expressing your devotion to God by sharing in the ministry contribute to your happiness?
Many who have been privileged to teach the truth to others have had the joy of seeing God’s spirit help such ones to improve their way of life.
BE OBSERVANT
10, 11. (a) How did Jesus and Paul show themselves to be alert and observant? (b) Illustrate how being alert and observant can improve our ministry.
Individuals ’ interest in the good news may be awakened in different ways.
So Christian ministers must be alert observers.
Jesus is our example. Being perfect, he could discern the unspoken indignation of a Pharisee, the sincere repentance of a sinful woman, and the self - sacrificing attitude of a widow.
Jesus could respond to the spiritual need of each one.
However, a servant of God does not have to be perfect to be a good observer.
The apostle Paul illustrates that.
He adapted his presentation so as to appeal to different groups and to people with varying attitudes. ​ — Acts 17: 22, 23, 34; 1 Cor. 9: 19 - 23.
By our striving to be alert and observant like Jesus and Paul, we can discern how best to awaken interest in those we meet. For example, as you approach individuals, look for clues that indicate their culture, interests, or family situation.
Perhaps you can notice what they are doing at the moment and make a polite comment about it as you initiate a conversation.
While engaging in the ministry, why should we be careful about our conversation?
An alert observer tries to avoid distractions.
While in the ministry, conversation with our partner can be upbuilding.
Still, we want to remember that our purpose in engaging in the field ministry is to preach to others.
So we should be careful that our conversation between doors does not interfere with our ministry.
Discussing thoughts that we would like to share with interested ones is a good way to keep our minds focused on our objective.
Also, although a cell phone may sometimes help us to be effective in our ministry, we should take steps to be sure that a phone call will not disrupt our conversation with a householder.
SHOW PERSONAL INTEREST
13, 14. (a) How can we discern what interests a person?
(b) What might awaken people’s interest in spiritual things?
Ministers who are awake and alert listen carefully to those they meet.
What questions can you pose in order to get someone in your territory to express his feelings?
Is he concerned about the number of religions, the violence in the area, or the failure of governments?
Can you awaken interest in spiritual matters by commenting on the marvelous design of living things or by pointing out how practical the Bible’s advice is?
Prayer interests people of nearly all cultures, even some atheists.
Many wonder if anyone hears prayers. Others may be intrigued by the questions: Does God hear all prayers?
If not, what should we do to be heard by God?
We can likely learn much about the art of initiating conversations by observing how experienced publishers do it.
Notice how they avoid the appearance of interrogating or prying.
15: 13.
KINDNESS AND SKILL
Why should kindness characterize our attempts to preach?
Do you like to be awakened from a deep sleep?
Many do not react well when awakened suddenly. A gentle approach is usually preferred.
The same is true regarding efforts to awaken people spiritually.
For example, if someone reacts angrily to your visit, what is usually the best response?
Kindly acknowledge his feelings, thank him for being frank, and calmly take your leave.
Your kindness may move such a person to react more positively the next time a Witness calls.
16, 17.
How can we use insight in our ministry?
In other cases, you may be able to overcome a negative reaction. Someone may say, “No thank you.
I have my own religion ” or, “I am not interested ” merely because it seems the easiest way to end the conversation.
Yet, with skill and kind persistence, you may be able to raise an intriguing question that awakens the householder’s interest in spiritual things. ​ — Read Colossians 4: 6.
Sometimes when we meet people who feel that they are too busy to listen, it is best to acknowledge the situation and leave.
On occasion, though, you may discern that you can say something brief and meaningful.
Some brothers are able to open the Bible, read a thought - provoking text, and leave the householder with a question ​ — all in less than a minute.
Their concise presentation has at times awakened so much interest that the householder finds that he is not too busy for a brief conversation.
Why not try to do that when the situation allows?
What might we do to be more effective at informal witnessing?
When we meet people during our daily activities, we can often awaken their interest in the good news if we are prepared to do informal witnessing.
Many brothers and sisters carry some literature in their pocket or handbag.
They may also have a specific Bible text in mind to share with others if the opportunity arises.
You might speak with the service overseer or pioneers in your congregation about how you can prepare yourself to do that.
GENTLY ROUSING OUR RELATIVES
Why should we not abandon efforts to help our relatives?
Naturally, we would like to help our relatives to accept the good news.
If our initial effort is rebuffed, that could dampen our enthusiasm for trying again.
We might imagine that there is little we can do or say that will change their attitude.
Still, events may cause a change in your relatives ’ life or viewpoint.
Or you may have improved in your ability to explain the truth, so that you might now have a different result.
Why is tact important when speaking to relatives?
We should avoid being insensitive to our relatives ’ feelings.
Should we not speak as kindly to them as we do to those we meet in the preaching work?
Speak with mildness and respect. Without being preachy, give evidence of how the truth has affected you for the good.
Make plain how Jehovah has enriched your life, “teaching you to benefit yourself. ”
Let your relatives see in you an example of Christian living.
21, 22.
Relate an experience that shows the value of persevering in efforts to help relatives spiritually.
Recently, a sister wrote: “I have always tried to witness to my 13 brothers and sisters by my speech and conduct.
I never let a year go by without writing to each of them.
Yet, for 30 years, I have been the only Witness in the family. ”
The sister continued: “One day, I phoned one of my sisters who lives hundreds of miles away.
She told me that she asked her preacher to study the Bible with her, but he never did.
When I said that I would be glad to help, she said: ‘ All right, but I am telling you now: I will never be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. ’
After mailing her the book What Does the Bible Really Teach?, I called her every few days. But she still had not opened the book.
Finally, I asked her to get her book, and for about 15 minutes over the phone, we read and discussed some of the quoted scriptures.
After a few more calls, she wanted to study for more than 15 minutes.
Then she began calling me for her study, sometimes before I was even out of bed in the morning and sometimes twice a day.
The next year, she got baptized, and the year after that, she began pioneering. ”
Why should we not tire out in trying to awaken people from spiritual sleep?
Helping people to wake up from spiritual sleep is an art and requires persistent effort.
Yet, meek people are still responding to our efforts to awaken them.
On average, over 20,000 people each month get baptized as Witnesses of Jehovah.
So let us take to heart Paul’s counsel to our first - century brother Archippus: “Keep watching the ministry which you accepted in the Lord, that you fulfill it. ”
The next article will help all to appreciate what it means to preach with a sense of urgency.

▪ Try new ways to preach to others
▪ Remember the importance of your ministry
Maintain Your Sense of Urgency
“Preach the word, be at it urgently. ” ​ — 2 TIM.
Why did first - century Christians preach with urgency?
How can we maintain our sense of urgency?
Why is Kingdom preaching more urgent now than ever?
1, 2.
What questions arise about the command to ‘ be at our preaching urgently ’?
PEOPLE whose job it is to save lives usually work with a sense of urgency.
For example, firefighters rush to an emergency call; they know that lives may be in danger.
As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we hope to help people to be saved.
To that end, we take seriously our commission to preach the good news of the Kingdom.
Of course, we do not dash about frantically.
Then what did the apostle Paul mean when he gave the admonition: “Preach the word, be at it urgently ”?
How can we preach with urgency?
And why is our work so urgent?
WHY IS OUR PREACHING URGENT?
People’s accepting or rejecting the Kingdom message can bring what results?
When you consider what stands to be gained or lost as a result of our preaching, you probably feel an urgent need to speak to others about the good news.
God’s Word says: “When I say to the wicked one: ‘ You will positively die, ’ and he actually turns back from his sin and carries on justice and righteousness,... he will positively keep living.
He will not die.
None of his sins with which he has sinned will be remembered against him. ” Indeed, the Bible tells those who teach the Kingdom message: “You will save both yourself and those who listen to you. ” ​ — 1 Tim. 4: 16; Ezek.
3: 17 - 21. Why did apostasy make preaching in the first century urgent?
To appreciate why Paul exhorted Timothy to preach with urgency, consider some of the context of our theme scripture.
We read: “Preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season, reprove, reprimand, exhort, with all long - suffering and art of teaching.
For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled; and they will turn their ears away from the truth. ”
Jesus had foretold that an apostasy would develop.
As that development approached, it was urgent for Timothy to “preach the word ” even inside the congregation so that Christians would not be misled by the deceptive attractiveness of false teachings.
Lives were at stake.
What about today?
5, 6.
We may encounter what popular ideas in our ministry?
Apostasy from true worship has now grown and spread.
What teachings tickle people’s ears today?
In many places, the teaching of evolution has been promoted with religious fervor.
Though evolution is usually presented in scientific language, it has become almost a secular religion, affecting how people view God and others.
Another popular teaching is that God is not interested in us; thus, we do not need to be interested in him.
Why are these teachings so attractive that they lull millions into spiritual sleep?
They both carry the underlying message, ‘ You can do anything you want because you will not be called to account. ’
This truly is a message that has tickled the ears of many. ​ — Read Psalm 10: 4.
But there are other ways that people have their ears tickled.
Some who still go to church like to have teachers who tell them, ‘ No matter what you do, God loves you. ’
Priests and pastors tickle the ears of others by convincing them that ceremonies, Masses, fiestas, and images have God’s blessing.
Little do these churchgoers realize the danger of their situation.
Yet, if we can awaken them spiritually so that they understand the Bible’s true message, they can benefit from God’s Kingdom.
WHAT DOES PREACHING WITH URGENCY MEAN?
How can we demonstrate our sense of urgency?
A conscientious surgeon must give undivided attention to his work because lives are at stake.
In our Christian ministry, we can demonstrate a sense of urgency by concentrating on our work, such as by thinking about what issues, questions, or information might interest the people we meet.
A sense of urgency might also lead us to adjust our schedule so as to visit people when they are more disposed to receive us. ​ — Rom.
1: 15, 16; 1 Tim. 4: 16.
What does acting with urgency usually involve?
Having a sense of urgency also involves setting priorities. (Read Genesis 19: 15.)
For example, imagine that after getting your test results back, your doctor called you into his office and earnestly said to you: “Look! Your situation is urgent.
You have at most a month to do something about your illness. ” You likely would not charge out of his office like a fireman on an emergency call.
But you would probably get his recommendations, go home, and give serious thought to your priorities.
Why can we say that Paul preached with urgency while in Ephesus?
We can gain insight into Paul’s urgency by noting what he told the elders from Ephesus about his preaching the good news in the district of Asia. (Read Acts 20: 18 - 21.)
Apparently from the first day he arrived, he got busy visiting people from house to house with the good news.
In addition, for two years he followed a regular schedule of “daily giving talks in the school auditorium of Tyrannus. ”
Clearly, Paul’s sense of urgency influenced his routine.
The call to ‘ be at our ministry urgently ’ is not intended to overwhelm us with our commission.
Nevertheless, the preaching work should take priority in our lives.
Why can we be pleased that Christians acted urgently some 100 years ago?
The example of a small group of Bible Students who prior to 1914 set out to preach the good news illustrates what it means to have a sense of urgency.
Although they were only a few thousand strong, they appreciated the urgency of the times and enthusiastically took up the Kingdom preaching work.
They had sermons published in hundreds of newspapers and presented a program of color slides and motion pictures called the “Photo - Drama of Creation. ”
In this way, they reached millions with the good news.
If they had not had a sense of urgency, how many of us would have heard the Kingdom message? ​ — Read Psalm 119: 60.
BEWARE OF LOSING YOUR SENSE OF URGENCY
What has led some to lose their sense of urgency?
Distractions can keep a person from thinking about how important the preaching work is.
Satan’s system is designed to get us absorbed in personal pursuits and side issues.
Some who at one time gave priority to Jehovah’s service lost their sense of urgency.
For instance, the first - century Christian named Demas had been a ‘ fellow worker ’ with Paul, but Demas became distracted by the ungodly system of things.
Instead of continuing to give priority to strengthening his brother in a time of trouble, Demas abandoned Paul. ​ — Philem.
23, 24; 2 Tim. 4: 10.
What opportunity is open now, and what opportunities will be opened to us forever?
If we are to maintain our sense of urgency, we need to fight the urge to enjoy more of what life offers.
We ought to work at getting “a firm hold on the real life. ”
You likely have no doubt that everlasting life on earth under God’s Kingdom will provide endless opportunities to enjoy interesting activities.
But for now, the opportunity to help others to survive Armageddon is unique to our time.
Now that we have become Christians, how can we maintain our sense of urgency?
Given that most in the world around us are unwisely sleeping in a spiritual sense, what can help us avoid losing our sense of urgency?
We can reflect on the fact that we at one time were sleeping in darkness, as it were.
But we were awakened, and Christ has shone on us, as Paul pointed out. We now have the privilege of being light bearers.
(Read Ephesians 5: 14.)
After mentioning that, Paul wrote: “Keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked. ”
Amid such wickedness, let us ‘ buy out the time ’ for activities that can keep us spiritually awake.
WE LIVE IN MOMENTOUS TIMES
14 - 16.
What makes Kingdom preaching more urgent now than ever?
The Christian ministry has always been urgent, but now it is more critical than ever. Since 1914, the composite sign described in God’s Word has become clear.
Mankind’s survival is threatened as never before.
Despite recent agreements, the superpowers still have some 2,000 nuclear warheads ready to launch.
Authorities report hundreds of instances of nuclear material being “lost. ”
Do terrorists have some of that?
Observers say mankind could easily be annihilated by a war that a terrorist initiates.
War, however, is not the only threat to man’s existence.
“Climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century, ” claims a 2009 report by The Lancet and University College London.
It said: “Effects of climate change on health will affect most populations in the next decades and put the lives and wellbeing of billions of people at increased risk. ”
The effect could be widespread destruction from rising sea levels, droughts, floods, epidemics, hurricanes, and wars over diminished resources.
Yes, wars and disasters threaten civilization.
Some people might think that the threat of nuclear war could lead to events that fulfill “the sign. ”
However, most do not understand the sign’s real significance.
It has been visible for decades now, which fact indicates that Christ’s presence is a reality and that the end of this system of things is rapidly approaching.
Never before have so many features of the sign been so clearly evident.
It is time for people to awaken from spiritual slumber. Our ministry can help awaken them.
17, 18. (a) How does “the season ” affect us?
(b) What could move people to change their view about the Kingdom message?
Only a short time remains to prove our love for Jehovah and to finish the preaching work assigned for the last days.
What Paul said to first - century Christians in Rome has even greater meaning today: “You people know the season, that it is already the hour for you to awake from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than at the time when we became believers. ” ​ — Rom.
13: 11. The events foretold for the last days can make individuals aware of their spiritual need.
Others become conscious of man’s need for help as they contemplate the failure of human governments to cope with economic disasters, nuclear threats, violent crime, or environmental destruction.
Still others are made aware of their spiritual need by events in their own family, such as a health crisis, a divorce, or the death of a loved one.
As we share in the ministry, we make ourselves available to help such people.
MOVED BY A SENSE OF URGENCY
19, 20.
How has a sense of urgency moved many Christians to change their lifestyle?
A sense of urgency has moved many Christians to increase their share in the ministry.
For example, a young Ecuadoran couple decided to simplify their life after they heard the 2006 special assembly day program “Keep Your Eye Simple. ”
They made a list of things they did not need, and within three months they moved from their three - bedroom apartment to a single - bedroom place, sold some things, and became debt free.
Soon they entered the auxiliary pioneer service and responded to the circuit overseer’s suggestion that they serve with a congregation where there was a greater need.
A North American brother writes: “When my wife and I attended an assembly in 2006, we had been baptized for 30 years.
While driving home after the program, we discussed how we could apply the counsel given on simplifying our life.
We owned three homes, land, luxury cars, a boat, and a motor home. Feeling that we must have looked like foolish Christians, we decided to make the full - time ministry our goal.
In 2008 we joined our daughter in the regular pioneer service.
What a joy it has been to work more closely with the brothers!
We have been able to serve where there is greater need. Also, the experience of doing more for Jehovah has drawn us closer to him.
Especially rewarding is the privilege of seeing people’s eyes light up when they hear and understand the truth of God’s Word. ”
What knowledge moves us to action?
We know what will soon overtake this wicked system of things ​ — “the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly men. ”
Our knowledge of God’s Word moves us to declare zealously the coming great tribulation and the new world to follow.
We continue to feel a keen sense of urgency to bring real hope to people.
By engaging in this urgent work to the full, we show true love for God and fellow man.
Rejoicing in Our Hope
“[There is] hope of the everlasting life which God, who cannot lie, promised before times long lasting. ” ​ — TITUS 1: 2.
Why do we know that there is joy in heaven when one of the anointed maintains a life course of integrity?
How is the realization of the hope of the other sheep related to that of the anointed?
To see our hope fulfilled, what “holy acts of conduct ” and“ deeds of godly devotion ” must we manifest?
How can the hope Jehovah has given us help us to endure?
JEHOVAH is “the God who gives hope. ” So said the apostle Paul, adding that Jehovah can ‘ fill us with all joy and peace by our believing, that we may abound in hope with power of holy spirit. ’
If our hope abounds in us, we will be able to endure any situation that may arise, our hearts filled with joy and peace.
As with anointed Christians, such a hope will prove to be “an anchor for the soul, both sure and firm ” for other Christians.
Our hope is something we can cling to during the storms of life, something that will help us not to drift into doubt or lack of faith. ​ — Read Hebrews 2: 1; 6: 11.
What two hopes are to be found among Christians today, and why are the “other sheep ” interested in the hope the anointed entertain?
Christians living at this time of the end focus their attention on one of two hopes.
The remaining members of the “little flock ” of anointed Christians have the hope of immortal life in heaven as kings and priests with Christ in his Kingdom.
The far more numerous “great crowd ” of“ other sheep ” share the hope of living forever on a paradise earth as subjects of the Messianic Kingdom.
The other sheep should never forget that their salvation depends on their active support of Christ’s anointed “brothers ” still on earth.
The anointed will enter into their reward, but the hope of the other sheep will just as certainly be fulfilled.
(Read Hebrews 11: 39, 40.)
First, let us examine the hope set before the anointed.
THE “LIVING HOPE ” OF ANOINTED CHRISTIANS
3, 4.
How do anointed Christians undergo “a new birth to a living hope, ” and what is that hope?
The apostle Peter wrote two letters to anointed Christians, whom he called “the ones chosen. ”
He provided details of the wonderful hope granted to the little flock.
In his first letter, Peter wrote: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for according to his great mercy he gave us a new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance.
It is reserved in the heavens for you, who are being safeguarded by God’s power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last period of time.
In this fact you are greatly rejoicing. ” ​ — 1 Pet.
1: 3 - 6. The limited number of Christians chosen by Jehovah to be associated with Christ in the heavenly Kingdom government undergo “a new birth ” as spirit - begotten sons of God.
They are anointed with holy spirit to become kings and priests with Christ.
Peter states that this “new birth ” opens up to them“ a living hope, ” which he calls “an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance ” reserved for them“ in the heavens. ”
Small wonder that the anointed ‘ greatly rejoice ’ in their living hope!
The realization of that hope, however, depends on their faithfulness.
5, 6.
Why must anointed Christians do their utmost to make their heavenly calling sure?
In his second letter, Peter exhorted anointed Christians to ‘ do their utmost to make their calling and choosing of themselves sure. ’
They must exert themselves to develop such Christian qualities as faith, godly devotion, brotherly affection, and love.
Peter stated: “If these things exist in you and overflow, they will prevent you from being either inactive or unfruitful. ” ​ — Read 2 Peter 1: 5 - 8.
In his message to the spirit - begotten elders in the first - century congregation of Philadelphia in Asia Minor, the risen Christ said: “Because you kept the word about my endurance, I will also keep you from the hour of test, which is to come upon the whole inhabited earth, to put a test upon those dwelling on the earth.
I am coming quickly. Keep on holding fast what you have, that no one may take your crown. ”
Were an anointed Christian to become unfaithful, he would not receive “the unfadable crown of glory ” promised to the chosen ones who remain faithful until death. ​ — 1 Pet. 5: 4; Rev. 2: 10.
AN ENTRANCE INTO THE KINGDOM
What wonderful hope did Jude mention in his letter?
About the year 65 C.E., Jesus ’ half brother Jude wrote a letter to his fellow anointed Christians, whom he addressed as “the called ones. ”
He had intended to write them a letter centering on the glorious hope of salvation that Christians called to God’s heavenly Kingdom “hold in common. ”
Although he had other urgent issues to address, at the conclusion of his short letter, he referred to the wonderful hope shared by anointed Christians, writing: “Now to the one who is able to guard you from stumbling and to set you unblemished in the sight of his glory with great joy, to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, might and authority for all past eternity and now and into all eternity. ” ​ — Jude 24, 25.
In line with Jude 24, what indicates that there is joy in heaven when one of the anointed proves his integrity?
Certainly, faithful anointed Christians want to be safeguarded against individually stumbling into destruction.
Their Bible - based hope is that Jesus Christ will resurrect them from the dead, allowing them to appear in spiritual perfection before the presence of God with great joy.
When one of the anointed dies faithful, it is with the sure prospect of being “raised up a spiritual body, ” resurrected“ in incorruption..., in glory. ”
If there is much “joy in heaven over one sinner that repents, ” imagine the joy in the heavenly courts when one of Christ’s spirit - begotten brothers finishes a life course of integrity.
Jehovah and the faithful spirit creatures will rejoice along with the anointed one then receiving his reward “with great joy. ” ​ — Read 1 John 3: 2.
How is entrance into the Kingdom “richly supplied ” to faithful anointed ones, and how does this hope affect the anointed yet on earth?
In the same vein, Peter wrote to anointed Christians that if they make their calling sure by their faithfulness, “there will be richly supplied to [them] the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. ”
Their entrance into their heavenly reward will be “richly supplied, ” their Christian qualities reflecting radiantly.
That it is “richly supplied ” may also suggest the superlative degree of blessedness that these who have exerted themselves in the race for life will enjoy.
They can look back on their faithful life course with hearts full of exultation and gratitude.
This prospect undoubtedly gives the anointed Christians yet on earth strength to ‘ brace up their minds for continued activity. ’ ​ — 1 Pet. 1: 13.
“THE BASIS OF HOPE ” FOR THE OTHER SHEEP
10, 11. (a) What hope is set before the other sheep?
(b) How is the realization of the earthly hope related to Christ and to “the revealing of the sons of God ”?
The apostle Paul wrote of the glorious hope of the spirit - begotten “sons of God ” as“ joint heirs ” of Christ.
Then he mentioned the wonderful hope that Jehovah holds out to the unlimited number of other sheep: “The eager expectation of the [human] creation is waiting for the revealing of the sons of God [the anointed].
For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will but through him that subjected it, on the basis of hope that the creation itself also will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God. ” ​ — Rom. 8: 14 - 21.
“The basis of hope ” for mankind was given by Jehovah when he promised deliverance from“ the original serpent, ” Satan the Devil, by means of the promised “seed. ”
That “seed ” was primarily Jesus Christ.
By his death and resurrection, Jesus provided a solid basis for mankind’s hope to be set free from enslavement to sin and death.
The realization of this hope is related to “the revealing of the sons of God. ”
The glorified anointed ones are the secondary part of the “seed. ”
They will be ‘ revealed ’ when they share with Christ in destroying Satan’s wicked system of things.
This will bring salvation to the other sheep who come out of the great tribulation. ​ — Rev. 7: 9, 10, 14.
The revealing of the anointed will have what glorious benefits for mankind?
What relief will come to human “creation ” during the Thousand Year Reign of Christ!
At that time, the glorified “sons of God ” will be further ‘ revealed ’ when they act as priests with Christ, administering the benefits of Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice to mankind.
As subjects of the heavenly Kingdom, human “creation ” will begin to experience deliverance from the effects of sin and death.
Obedient humans will gradually “be set free from enslavement to corruption. ”
If they remain faithful to Jehovah throughout the Millennium and during the final test that will come at the end of it, their names will be permanently written in “the scroll of life. ” They will enter into“ the glorious freedom of the children of God. ”
A glorious hope indeed!
KEEPING OUR HOPE ALIVE
Upon what is our hope founded, and when will Christ be revealed?
Peter’s two inspired letters contain much to help the anointed and the other sheep to keep their respective hopes alive.
He pointed out that their hope is not founded on their works, but on Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.
He wrote: “Keep balanced and set your hope completely upon the undeserved kindness that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. ”
Christ will be revealed when he comes to reward his faithful followers and execute Jehovah’s judgments upon the ungodly. ​ — Read 2 Thessalonians 1: 6 - 10.
14, 15. (a) To keep our hope alive, on what must we focus our attention?
(b) What counsel did Peter give?
To keep our hope alive, we must focus our attention and center our lives on the coming “day of Jehovah. ”
That will bring the destruction of the present - day “heavens, ” or human rulership, and“ earth, ” wicked human society and its “elements. ”
Peter wrote: “What sort of persons ought you to be..., awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah, through which the heavens being on fire will be dissolved and the elements being intensely hot will melt! ” ​ — 2 Pet.
3: 10 - 12. The present “heavens ” and“ earth ” will be replaced by “new heavens [Christ’s Kingdom government] and a new earth [a new earthly society]. ”
Peter then gave straightforward counsel, based on the fact of our “awaiting, ” or keeping our hope alive for, this promised new world:“ Hence, beloved ones, since you are awaiting these things, do your utmost to be found finally by him spotless and unblemished and in peace. ” ​ — 2 Pet.
3: 14. WALKING IN LINE WITH OUR HOPE
16, 17. (a) What “holy acts of conduct ” and“ deeds of godly devotion ” should we manifest?
(b) How will our hope be fulfilled?
Not only must we keep our hope alive but we must also live in harmony with our hope.
We should pay attention to the sort of person we are spiritually.
“Holy acts of conduct ” involve our ‘ maintaining our conduct fine among the nations, ’ by our moral rectitude.
We must have ‘ love among ourselves. ’
That includes doing all we can to maintain the unity of our worldwide brotherhood even among those in our local congregation.
“Deeds of godly devotion ” are deeds that confirm our close relationship with Jehovah.
This involves the quality of our prayers, as well as our daily Bible reading, deep personal study, family worship, and an active share in preaching the “good news of the kingdom. ” ​ — Matt.
24: 14.
Each of us wants to be the sort of person Jehovah approves of and will save when the present wicked system is “dissolved. ”
We will thus experience the realization of our hope, the “hope of the everlasting life which God, who cannot lie, promised before times long lasting. ” ​ — Titus 1: 2.

Anointed Christians undergo “a new birth to a living hope ”

Keep the hope alive in your family
Do Not Look at “the Things Behind ”
“No man that has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is well fitted for the kingdom of God. ” ​ — LUKE 9: 62.
Why should we “remember the wife of Lot ”?
What three things should we avoid dwelling on?
How do we keep pace with Jehovah’s organization?
What warning did Jesus give, and what question arises?
“REMEMBER the wife of Lot. ” That warning given by Jesus Christ nearly 2,000 years ago is now more important than ever.
But what did Jesus mean by this solemn warning?
They knew what had happened to Lot’s wife.
While fleeing Sodom with her family, she had disobediently looked back and was turned into a pillar of salt. ​ — Read Genesis 19: 17, 26.
Why may Lot’s wife have looked back, and what did her disobedient act cost her?
But why did Lot’s wife look back?
Did she turn back because of disbelief or lack of faith? Or, rather, was hers a longing gaze for all the things that she had left behind in Sodom?
Whatever the reason for her looking back, she paid for her disobedient act with her life. Just think of it!
She died the same day as those perverted inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah. No wonder Jesus said: “Remember the wife of Lot ”!
How did Jesus emphasize that we should not look back in a figurative sense?
We too are living at a time when it is vital that we do not look back in a figurative sense.
Jesus emphasized this point when he answered a man who had asked if he could return to his family to say good - bye before becoming a disciple. Jesus said: “No man that has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is well fitted for the kingdom of God. ”
Was Jesus being harsh or unreasonable in answering this way?
No, for he knew that the man’s request was merely an excuse to evade responsibility.
Jesus described such procrastination as looking at “the things behind. ”
Does it matter whether the person plowing looks momentarily at what is behind or actually puts down the plow and turns around?
Either way he is distracted from what he should be doing, and his work may be affected negatively. On what must we keep our eyes focused?
Rather than turning our attention to the past, we must keep our eyes focused on what is yet ahead.
Notice how this is clearly expressed at Proverbs 4: 25: “As for your eyes, straight ahead they should look, yes, your own beaming eyes should gaze straight in front of you. ”
We have what reason not to look at the things behind?
We have good reason not to look at the things behind. What is the reason?
These are “the last days. ”
We now face, not just the wiping out of two wicked cities, but the destruction of an entire world system of things.
What will help us to avoid anything similar to what happened to Lot’s wife?
For a start, we need to identify some of the things behind us that we might be tempted to look at.
Let us consider, then, what those things are and determine how we can avoid focusing on them.
THE GOOD OLD DAYS
Why is our memory not always reliable?
One distinct danger is a distorted view of the good old days. Our memory is not always reliable.
We may unwittingly minimize the problems we had in the past and at the same time exaggerate the joys, making it seem that things were a lot better than they really were.
This distorted recollection can cause us to long for the good old days.
But the Bible warns us: “Do not say, ‘ Why were the old days better than these days? ’
for it is not wise to ask that. ”
Why is this type of thinking so dangerous?
7 - 9. (a) What happened to the Israelites in Egypt?
(b) The Israelites experienced what reasons for joy?
(c) Over what did the Israelites begin to grumble and murmur?
Consider what happened to the Israelites in Moses ’ day.
Although the Israelites were initially viewed as guests in the land of Egypt, after Joseph’s time the Egyptians “set over [the Israelites] chiefs of forced labor for the purpose of oppressing them in their burden - bearing. ”
God’s people eventually faced a type of genocide as Pharaoh attempted to limit their numbers.
It is little wonder, then, that Jehovah said to Moses: “Unquestionably I have seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their outcry as a result of those who drive them to work; because I well know the pains they suffer. ” ​ — Ex.
3: 7.
Can you imagine the joy the Israelites felt as they marched out of the land of their slavery as free people?
In a spectacular way, they had witnessed Jehovah’s power when he brought the Ten Plagues upon haughty Pharaoh and his people.
(Read Exodus 6: 1, 6, 7.)
In fact, not only did the Egyptians finally allow the Israelites to go free but the Egyptians urged them to go, giving them so much gold and silver that it could be said that God’s people “stripped the Egyptians. ”
The Israelites further rejoiced when they saw the destruction of Pharaoh and his military forces in the Red Sea.
Unbelievably, though, within a short time of their miraculous deliverance, these same people began to grumble and murmur.
About what?
They became dissatisfied with what Jehovah supplied and complained: “How we remember the fish that we used to eat in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers and the watermelons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic!
But now our soul is dried away.
Our eyes are on nothing at all except the manna. ”
Yes, their viewpoint had become distorted ​ — so much so that they even wanted to return to the land of their slavery!
The Israelites looked at the things behind and lost Jehovah’s favor. ​ — Num.
11: 10.
The Israelites ’ example provides what lesson for us?
What is the lesson for us today?
When faced with difficulties and problems, let us not fixate on what may appear to have been positive things in the past ​ — perhaps even before we came to a knowledge of the truth.
Although it is not wrong to meditate on the lessons we have learned from past experiences or to savor cherished memories, we need to maintain a balanced, realistic view of the past.
Otherwise, we could accentuate our dissatisfaction with our present circumstances and be tempted to return to our former way of life. ​ — Read 2 Peter 2: 20 - 22.
PAST SACRIFICES
How do some view sacrifices they made in the past?
Sad to say, some look back on sacrifices they made in the past and view them as missed opportunities.
Perhaps you had opportunities for higher education, for prominence, or for financial security, but you decided not to pursue them.
Many of our brothers and sisters have left behind lucrative positions in the fields of business, entertainment, education, or sports. Now time has passed, and the end has not yet arrived.
How did Paul feel about the things he had left behind?
The apostle Paul gave up much to become a follower of Christ.
How did he feel about the things he had left behind?
He tells us: “What things were gains to me, these I have considered loss on account of the Christ. ” And why?
He continues: “I do indeed also consider all things to be loss on account of the excelling value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.
On account of him I have taken the loss of all things and I consider them as a lot of refuse, that I may gain Christ. ”
* Just as a person who throws away garbage, or trash, does not later bemoan his loss, Paul did not regret any of the secular opportunities that he had left behind.
He no longer felt that they were worthwhile.
13, 14.
How can we follow the example set by Paul?
What will help us if we find ourselves starting to speculate about so - called missed opportunities? Follow the example set by Paul.
Consider the value of what you have now.
You have gained a treasured relationship with Jehovah and have established a faithful record with him.
What material advantages can the world offer that would come anywhere near the spiritual blessings that we now enjoy and will enjoy in the future? ​ — Read Mark 10: 28 - 30.
Paul next mentions something that will help us to continue to go on faithfully.
He says that he was “forgetting the things behind and stretching forward to the things ahead. ”
Notice that Paul highlights two steps, both necessary.
First, we have to forget the things we left behind, not wasting precious energy and time being overly concerned about them.
Second, like a runner at the finish line, we need to stretch forward, keeping focused on what lies ahead.
What benefit do we gain when we meditate on the examples of faithful servants of God?
When we meditate on the examples of faithful servants of God ​ — whether past or present — ​ we can gain additional motivation to keep moving forward rather than looking at the things behind.
For example, if Abraham and Sarah had kept remembering Ur, “they would have had opportunity to return. ”
But they did not return there. Moses originally left behind far more in Egypt than any other individual Israelite later did.
Yet, there is no record of his longing for those things.
Instead, the Bible account tells us that “he esteemed the reproach of the Christ as riches greater than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward. ” ​ — Heb.
PAST NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES
How may we be affected by past experiences?
Not all past experiences, though, may appear positive.
Perhaps we are overwhelmed by thoughts of past sins or mistakes that we made.
We might still feel the sting of strong counsel that we received.
Injustices ​ — real or perhaps perceived — ​ may dominate our thinking.
What can we do to make sure that we do not allow such experiences to make us focus on the things behind?
Consider three examples.
(a) Why did Paul describe himself as “a man less than the least of all holy ones ”?
(b) What helped Paul not to be overwhelmed by negative thoughts?
The apostle Paul described himself as “a man less than the least of all holy ones. ”
“Because I persecuted the congregation of God, ” he says.
Can you imagine how Paul must have felt when he met up with some whom he had formerly persecuted?
However, rather than allowing these negative thoughts to overwhelm him, Paul focused on the undeserved kindness that had been shown to him.
The resulting gratitude that he felt spurred him on in his ministry.
His former sinful conduct was included in the things that Paul was determined to forget.
If we too focus on the mercy Jehovah has shown us, we will avoid having our strength sapped by undue anxiety over past events that we cannot change.
We can use our strength for the work at hand.
(a) What may happen if we look back negatively at counsel that we received?
(b) How can we heed Solomon’s words on accepting counsel?
What if we are tempted to look back resentfully at some counsel that we received?
This can be not only painful but also debilitating ​ — causing us to “give out. ”
Whether we “belittle ” the counsel because we reject it or we“ give out ” because we accept it and then give up, the result is the same ​ — we do not truly allow the counsel to benefit and refine us.
How much better to heed Solomon’s words: “Take hold on discipline; do not let go.
Safeguard it, for it itself is your life. ”
Like a driver who obeys road signs, let us accept the counsel, apply it, and move forward. ​ — Prov. 4: 26, 27; read Hebrews 12: 12, 13.
How can we imitate the faith of Habakkuk and Jeremiah?
Injustices ​ — real or perceived.
We may at times feel like the prophet Habakkuk, who cried out to Jehovah for justice, not understanding why Jehovah had allowed certain unfair things to happen.
How important it is for us to imitate the faith of that prophet, who said: “Yet, as for me, I will exult in Jehovah himself; I will be joyful in the God of my salvation. ”
Like Jeremiah of old, if we keep “a waiting attitude ” with full faith in Jehovah, the God of justice, we can be confident that all things will be rectified at the right time. ​ — Lam.
3: 19 - 24.
How can we prove that we “remember the wife of Lot ”?
We live in exciting times.
Wonderful events are happening now and more lie just ahead.
May each one of us keep pace with Jehovah’s organization.
Let us heed the Scriptural counsel to look forward and not to look at the things behind.
We will thereby prove that we do “remember the wife of Lot ”!
The original - language word here translated “refuse ” also meant what“ is thrown to the dogs, ” “dung, ”“ excrement. ”
One Bible scholar says that Paul’s use of this word denotes a “resolute turning aside from something worthless and abhorrent with which one will have nothing more to do. ”
Questions From Readers
Could a Christian’s practice of viewing pornography become so bad that it results in his being expelled from the Christian congregation?
▪ Yes, it could.
That underscores why it is vital to shun vigorously all pornography ​ — both written material and images — ​ in magazines, in films, in videos, and on the Internet.
Pornography is found everywhere around the globe.
The Internet makes pornographic material more available than ever and has increased the number affected by this terrible plague.
Some, young and old, have accidentally come across pornographic Web sites.
Others have deliberately gone to them, feeling less inhibited because they can read or view pornography in secret ​ — at home or at the office.
Why should this seriously concern Christians?
We find a fundamental reason in Jesus ’ warning: “Everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. ”
Of course, normal sexual relations are proper and a source of pleasure between marriage mates.
But that is not the focus of pornography.
Rather, it features illicit sex that stimulates the sort of immoral thoughts that Jesus warned against.
Plainly, reading or viewing pornography goes directly contrary to the divine direction: “Deaden, therefore, your body members that are upon the earth as respects fornication, uncleanness, sexual appetite, hurtful desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. ” ​ — Col.
3: 5. What if a Christian did view pornography on an occasion or two?
His case might, in a sense, be likened to the dangerous situation in which the psalmist Asaph once found himself: “As for me, my feet had almost turned aside, my steps had nearly been made to slip. ”
How could the Christian have a clean conscience and be at peace with God if he was gazing at pornographic images of naked men or women or of a couple engaging in fornication?
Nor was Asaph at peace: “I came to be plagued all day long, and my correction is every morning. ” ​ — Ps.
73: 2, 14.
A Christian caught up in that badness should wake up and face his need for spiritual help.
That help is available in the congregation: “Even though a man takes some false step before he is aware of it, you who have spiritual qualifications try to readjust such a man in a spirit of mildness, as you each keep an eye on yourself. ”
A Christian elder or two could give him the help he needs, including ‘ prayers of faith that can make the indisposed one well, and his sin can be forgiven. ’
Those who have sought help to remove the stain of pornography have seen that drawing near to God has been good for them, as it was for Asaph. ​ — Ps.
73: 28.
However, the apostle Paul said that some who sinned did not repent “over their uncleanness and fornication and loose conduct. ”
* Regarding the Greek term there rendered “uncleanness, ” Professor Marvin R.
Vincent wrote that it has “the sense of impurity on the side of sordidness. ”
It is a sad fact that some pornography is much worse than scenes of nakedness or of a man and woman engaging in fornication.
There is sordid, abhorrent pornography involving homosexuality (sex between those of the same gender), group sex, bestiality, child pornography, gang rape, the brutalizing of women, bondage, or sadistic torture.
Some in Paul’s day who were “in darkness mentally ” came to be“ past all moral sense [and] gave themselves over to loose conduct to work uncleanness of every sort with greediness. ” ​ — Eph. 4: 18, 19.
Paul also mentioned “uncleanness ” at Galatians 5: 19.
A British scholar noted that it “may here [signify] more especially all unnatural lusts. ”
What Christian would deny that the above - mentioned abhorrent, sexually degrading forms of pornography are “unnatural lusts ” and are sordid?
Paul concluded at Galatians 5: 19 - 21 that “those who practice ” such uncleanness“ will not inherit God’s kingdom. ”
Consequently, if someone developed an entrenched practice of viewing abhorrent, sexually degrading pornography, perhaps over a considerable period of time, and would not repent and turn around, he could not remain in the Christian congregation.
He would have to be disfellowshipped in order to preserve the cleanness and spirit of the congregation. ​ — 1 Cor.
It is good to know that some who fell into viewing abhorrent forms of pornography went to the elders and received the spiritual help needed to make drastic changes.
Certainly unless you wake up,... you will not know at all at what hour I shall come upon you. ”
It is possible to repent and be snatched out of the fire, as it were. ​ — Jude 22, 23.
How much better, though, it is for each of us to be firmly resolved not to come anywhere near that dangerous position.
Yes, we should be absolutely determined to avoid all forms of pornography!
As to distinctions between “uncleanness and fornication and loose conduct, ” see The Watchtower of July 15, 2006, pages 29 - 31.

A Christian caught up in badness should wake up and face his need for spiritual help
“Would You Please Take Our Picture? ”
After the second day of a district convention, Josué, a Bethelite in Mexico, was touring the city of Querétaro.
Colombian tourists Javier and Maru, a married couple, asked Josué to take their picture.
Because he and his Witness friends were well - dressed and were wearing convention badges, the couple asked them if they had come from a graduation or another special occasion.
The couple felt that they would be too embarrassed to attend because they had no proper attire for such an occasion.
Nonetheless, Josué gave them his name and the telephone number of the branch office where he served.
To Josué’s surprise, four months later he heard from Javier.
The couple had attended the convention and now wanted to have Jehovah’s Witnesses visit them in Mexico City, where they were residing at the time.
Soon a Bible study was started with Javier and Maru, and they immediately began attending meetings. Ten months later, they were publishers.
Though the couple had to move to Toronto, Canada, they continued to make spiritual progress and were baptized.
Later, Josué received a letter from Javier explaining what had moved him to accept the truth.
“Before attending the convention, my wife and I had spoken of our need for spiritual guidance.
When we saw how well - dressed you were, we thought that you must have been to a very special meeting.
At the convention, we were impressed by the loving way we were shown to our seats, by the help offered to follow along in the Bible, and by the conduct of those in attendance.
It did not seem to matter that we were dressed as tourists. ” How true the words of wise King Solomon proved to be for Josué!
Solomon wrote: “In the morning sow your seed and until the evening do not let your hand rest; for you are not knowing where this will have success, either here or there, or whether both of them will alike be good. ”
Can you sow seed by using opportunities to tell others about an upcoming convention or a public talk?
Jehovah may use you to attract those who are hungering and thirsting for spiritual guidance, as Javier and Maru were. ​ — Isa.
55: 1.

Draw Close to God
Did you at one time serve Jehovah?
Have you thought about serving him again but wondered whether he would welcome you back?
Please carefully read this article and the one that follows. They were prepared especially with you in mind.
“I PRAYED to Jehovah to please let me come home and to forgive me for hurting him. ”
So said one woman who had strayed far from her Christian upbringing.
Does your heart go out to her?
Do you wonder: ‘ How does God feel about those who once served him?
Does he remember them?
Does he want them to “come home ”? ’
To answer those questions, let us examine words recorded by Jeremiah. The answers will no doubt warm your heart. ​ — Read Jeremiah 31: 18 - 20.
Consider the setting of Jeremiah’s words.
In 740 B.C.E., decades before Jeremiah’s day, Jehovah permitted the ten - tribe kingdom of Israel to be taken captive by the Assyrians.
* God allowed this calamity as discipline because his people had taken up sinning in gross ways, ignoring the repeated warnings of his prophets.
Were the people softened by the hardships they experienced in exile, when they were separated from their God and far away from their homeland?
Did Jehovah forget all about them?
Would he ever welcome them back home?
“I Felt Regret ”
The people came to their senses in captivity and were moved to repentance.
Their heartfelt contrition did not escape Jehovah’s notice.
Listen as Jehovah describes the attitude and feelings of the exiled Israelites, spoken of collectively as Ephraim.
“I have positively heard Ephraim bemoaning himself, ” says Jehovah.
He heard the Israelites as they lamented the effects of their sinful course.
The phrase “bemoaning himself ” can mean“ a shaking or rocking motion, ” says one scholar.
They were like a wayward son ruefully shaking his head as he reflects on the hardships he has brought upon himself and longs for the life he had back home.
What were the people saying?
“You have corrected me... like a calf that has not been trained. ”
The people acknowledged that they deserved the discipline.
After all, they had been like an untrained calf.
This simile may mean that they had been like a bullock that would never have “felt the goad if he had not first rebelled against the yoke, ” says one reference work.
“Cause me to turn back, and I shall readily turn back, for you are Jehovah my God. ”
Their hearts humbled, the people called out to God.
They had been lost in a sinful course, but now they pleaded for help to find their way back into his favor.
One translation says: “You are our God ​ — please let us come home. ” ​ — Contemporary English Version.
“I felt regret....
I became ashamed, and I also felt humiliated. ”
The people felt sorry because they had sinned.
They accepted the blame and admitted their guilt.
The Israelites were repentant.
They were filled with sorrow, confessed their sins to God, and turned back from their bad ways.
Would their repentance soften God’s heart?
Would he let them come home?
“By All Means I Shall Have Pity Upon Him ”
Jehovah had a special attachment to the Israelites.
He said: “I have become to Israel a Father; and as for Ephraim, he is my firstborn. ”
How could a loving father refuse to welcome back a son whose heart is filled with genuine remorse?
Notice how Jehovah expresses his Fatherly feelings for his people.
“Is Ephraim a precious son to me, or a fondly treated child?
For to the extent of my speaking against him I shall without fail remember him further. ”
How tender those words are!
Like a firm but loving parent, God had been obliged to speak “against ” his children, repeatedly warning them about their sinful ways.
When they stubbornly refused to listen, he let them go into exile ​ — in effect, making them leave home.
But even though he had to punish them, he did not forget them.
He could never do that. A loving father does not forget his children.
How, though, did Jehovah feel when he saw true repentance in his children?
“My intestines have become boisterous for him.
* By all means I shall have pity upon him. ”
Jehovah felt a strong yearning for his children.
Their sincere repentance touched his heart, and he had a deep longing for them to return to him.
Like the father in Jesus ’ parable of the prodigal son, Jehovah “was moved with pity ” and eager to welcome his children back home. ​ — Luke 15: 20.
“Jehovah Let Me Come Home! ”
The words at Jeremiah 31: 18 - 20 give us insight into Jehovah’s tender compassion and mercy.
God does not forget those who once served him.
What if such ones want to return to him? God is “ready to forgive. ”
He will never turn away those who come to him with repentant hearts.
On the contrary, he is happy to welcome them home. ​ — Luke 15: 22 - 24.
The woman mentioned at the outset took the initiative to return to Jehovah and visited a local congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
At first, she had to overcome her own negative feelings.
“I felt so unworthy, ” she recalls.
But the congregation’s elders offered encouragement and helped her to regain spiritual strength.
With a heart full of appreciation, she says, “It is so wonderful that Jehovah let me come home! ”
If you once served Jehovah and have thought about serving him again, we invite you to visit the local congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Remember that Jehovah responds with compassion and mercy when repentant ones call out to him, “Please let us come home. ” Suggested Bible reading for April: ▪ Jeremiah 17 - 31
Centuries earlier, in 997 B.C.E., the Israelites were split into two kingdoms. One was the southern two - tribe kingdom of Judah. The other was the northern ten - tribe kingdom of Israel, also called Ephraim, for its most prominent tribe.
Learn From God’s Word
This article considers questions you may have raised and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible.
Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.
What does Christian baptism mean?
Baptism is a request for a good relationship with God.
So, a Christian should be baptized, not when a baby, but when he or she is old enough to learn about God and become a disciple of Jesus.
We become a disciple of Jesus when we learn and do the things that he commanded. ​ — Read Matthew 28: 19, 20.
In the days of Jesus ’ apostles, many people took action without delay to learn about God and Jesus.
For example, when one man learned that Jesus ’ death had opened the way to salvation, he immediately became a disciple.
Today, many sincere people have chosen to become Jesus ’ followers. ​ — Read Acts 8: 26 - 31, 35 - 38.
Why was Jesus baptized?
Jesus was about 30 years of age when John the Baptizer dipped him under the water of the Jordan River.
Jesus ’ baptism represented his decision to do God’s will for him.
This would include his laying down his life as a sacrifice for the sins of humankind.
Even before he came down from heaven to live on earth, Jesus had always loved and obeyed his Father, Jehovah. ​ — Read Mark 1: 9 - 11; John 8: 29; 17: 5.
Why should a Christian be baptized?
Our situation is different from that of Jesus ​ — we are born as sinners.
Yet, Jesus ’ sacrificial death makes it possible for us to have a good relationship with God.
It is actually possible for us to belong to him as a member of his family.
How do we gain that privilege?
In private prayer, we dedicate ourselves to Jehovah, vowing to do his will for the rest of our life.
After making such a dedication, we symbolize it in public by being baptized. ​ — Read Matthew 16: 24; 1 Peter 4: 2.
How can you prepare for baptism?
Jehovah’s Witnesses study the Bible with anyone who wants to draw close to God.
Studying the Bible and attending Christian meetings will strengthen your love for God and your faith in him.
It will also help you to cultivate positive attitudes and habits.
Developing love, faith, and other godly qualities will help you live up to your vow to serve Jehovah forever. ​ — Read John 17: 3; Hebrews 10: 24, 25.
For more information, see chapter 18 of this book, What Does the Bible Really Teach?, published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.
A Conversation With a Neighbor ​ — Is Jesus God?
JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES enjoy discussing the Bible with their neighbors.
Is there a particular Bible subject that you have wondered about?
Are you curious about any of the beliefs or religious practices of Jehovah’s Witnesses?
If so, do not hesitate to bring up the subject the next time you come in contact with a Witness.
He or she will be pleased to discuss such matters with you.
The following is a typical conversation that one of Jehovah’s Witnesses might have with a neighbor. Let us imagine that a Witness named Karen has come to the home of a woman named Samantha.
Is It True That You Do Not Believe in Jesus?
Samantha: My pastor says that Jehovah’s Witnesses do not believe in Jesus.
Is that true?
Karen: Let me assure you that we do believe in Jesus.
In fact, we believe that exercising faith in Jesus is vital to salvation.
Samantha: I believe that too.
Karen: So this is something that you and I have in common.
By the way, my name is Karen.
Samantha: Samantha.
Nice to meet you. Karen: Nice to meet you too, Samantha.
You may wonder, ‘ If Jehovah’s Witnesses really do believe in Jesus, why do people say otherwise? ’
Samantha: Yes, I’m curious about that.
Karen: In a nutshell, Samantha, we have very strong faith in Jesus, but we do not believe everything that people say about him.
Samantha: Can you give me an example?
Karen: Yes.
Some people say that Jesus was simply a good man.
But we do not agree with that idea. Samantha: Neither do I.
Karen: So that’s another thing that you and I have in common.
A second example is that Jehovah’s Witnesses do not agree with teachings that contradict what Jesus himself said about his relationship with the Father.
Samantha: What do you mean?
Karen: Many religions teach that Jesus is God.
Perhaps that is what you have been taught.
Samantha: Yes, my pastor says that God and Jesus are the same.
Karen: Would you agree, though, that the best way to learn the truth about Jesus is to examine what he said about himself?
Samantha: Yes, I would agree with that.
What Did Jesus Say?
Karen: Let’s consider a Bible verse that sheds some light on the matter.
Notice, please, what we read at John 6: 38.
Jesus said: “I have come down from heaven to do, not my will, but the will of him that sent me. ”
Now, that statement would be a bit puzzling if Jesus were God.
Samantha: What do you mean?
Karen: Well, notice that Jesus said he did not come down from heaven to do his own will.
Samantha: Right, he said that he came to do the will of the One who sent him.
Karen: But if Jesus is God, who sent him down from heaven?
And why did Jesus yield to the will of that One?
Samantha: I see what you’re getting at.
But I’m not sure that this one verse proves Jesus isn’t God.
Karen: Consider, though, what Jesus said on another occasion.
He made a similar statement in the next chapter of John. Would you please read John 7: 16?
Samantha: Sure.
“Jesus, in turn, answered them and said: ‘ What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him that sent me. ’ ”
Karen: Thank you, Samantha.
According to this verse, did Jesus teach his own ideas?
Samantha: No, he said that his teachings belong to the One who sent him.
Karen: That’s right.
Again, we have to wonder: ‘ Who sent Jesus?
And who gave him the truths he taught? ’
Wouldn’t that One be greater than Jesus?
After all, the sender is superior to the one who is sent.
Samantha: That’s interesting.
I never read that passage before.
Karen: Consider, too, Jesus ’ words at John 14: 28: “You heard that I said to you, I am going away and I am coming back to you.
If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going my way to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am. ”
Based on that verse, how would you say Jesus viewed himself in relation to the Father?
Samantha: Well, he said that the Father is greater than he is.
So I guess he viewed God as his superior.
Karen: Exactly.
For another example, notice what Jesus told his disciples as recorded at Matthew 28: 18.
That verse says: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth. ”
So did Jesus say that he always had all authority?
Samantha: No, he said that it had been given to him.
Karen: But if Jesus is God, how could he be given more authority?
And who gave it to him?
Samantha: I’ll have to think about that.
To Whom Was He Speaking?
Karen: There is something else that is rather puzzling if Jesus truly is God.
Samantha: What’s that?
Karen: It’s what we read about Jesus ’ baptism.
Notice the account recorded at Luke 3: 21, 22.
Would you please read those verses?
Samantha: “Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized and, as he was praying, the heaven was opened up and the holy spirit in bodily shape like a dove came down upon him, and a voice came out of heaven: ‘ You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you. ’ ”
Karen: Did you notice what Jesus was doing as he was being baptized?
Samantha: He was praying.
Karen: Yes.
Of course, we might wonder, ‘ If Jesus is God, to whom was he praying? ’
Samantha: That’s a good question.
I’ll have to ask my pastor.
Karen: Along a similar line, note that after Jesus came up out of the water, someone spoke from heaven. Did you notice what that One said?
Samantha: He said that Jesus was His Son, that He loved him, and that He approved of him.
Karen: That’s right.
But if Jesus is God, who said those things from heaven?
Samantha: I never thought of it that way before.
Why “Father ” and“ Son ”?
Karen: Here’s something else to consider: We’ve read that Jesus spoke of God as his heavenly Father.
And when Jesus was baptized, a voice from heaven referred to Jesus as His Son.
In fact, Jesus specifically called himself God’s Son.
Now, if you wanted to teach me that two people are equal, what sort of family relationship might you use to illustrate the point?
Samantha: I might use two brothers.
Karen: Exactly ​ — perhaps even identical twins.
But Jesus referred to God as the Father and to himself as the Son.
So, what message do you suppose Jesus was conveying?
Samantha: I see your point.
Jesus is describing one individual as being older and as having more authority than the other.
Karen: Exactly.
Think about this: You came up with such a fitting illustration of equality, that of brothers or twins.
If Jesus really were God, don’t you think that Jesus, as the Great Teacher, would have thought of the same comparison ​ — or an even clearer example of equality?
Samantha: Of course.
Karen: But, instead, he used the terms “Father ” and“ Son ” to describe his relationship with God.
Samantha: You raise an interesting point.
What Did Jesus ’ Early Followers Say?
Karen: Before I leave, I’d like to consider one other aspect of this subject with you, if you have a moment.
Samantha: Yes, I have a few minutes.
Karen: If Jesus truly is God, wouldn’t you expect that Jesus ’ disciples would have plainly said so?
Samantha: That seems reasonable.
Karen: Yet, nowhere in the Scriptures do we read of their teaching that.
On the contrary, notice what one of Jesus ’ early followers, the apostle Paul, wrote. At Philippians 2: 9, he describes what God did after Jesus ’ death and resurrection: “God exalted him [Jesus] to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name. ”
According to this verse, what did God do for Jesus?
Samantha: It says that God exalted him to a superior position.
Karen: Yes.
But if Jesus were equal to God before he died and God later exalted him to a higher position, wouldn’t that put Jesus above God?
How could anyone be superior to God?
Samantha: He couldn’t.
It’s impossible. Karen: I agree.
Based on all this evidence, then, would you say that the Bible teaches that Jesus is God?
Samantha: No, it doesn’t seem that way.
The Bible says that he is God’s Son.
Karen: That’s right.
Let me assure you though, Samantha, that Jehovah’s Witnesses hold Jesus in very high regard.
Samantha: I believe that too.
Karen: You might wonder, then, ‘ How can we show Jesus that we appreciate his giving his life in our behalf? ’
Samantha: I have wondered about that.
Karen: Perhaps I could come back and share the Bible’s answer with you.
Will you be home about this time next week?
Samantha: Yes, I will be here.
Karen: Great, I’ll see you then.

‘ The Son Is Willing to Reveal the Father ’
“Who the Father is, no one knows but the Son, and he to whom the Son is willing to reveal him. ” ​ — LUKE 10: 22.
HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER?
Why was Jesus in a unique position to reveal his Father?
How did Jesus reveal his Father to others?
In what ways can you imitate Jesus in revealing the Father?
1, 2.
What question has puzzled many, and why?
‘ WHO is God? ’ This question puzzles many.
For instance, although most nominal Christians believe that God is a Trinity, many will admit that this doctrine is impossible to understand.
One author and clergyman acknowledged: “This is a doctrine beyond the scope of man’s finite mind.
It lies outside the realm of natural reason or human logic. ”
On the other hand, most who accept the theory of evolution believe that there is no God.
They attribute all the wonders of creation to blind chance.
Even so, instead of denying God’s existence, Charles Darwin said: “The safest conclusion seems to me that the whole subject is beyond the scope of man’s intellect. ”
Most people, whatever their beliefs, have pondered over questions related to God’s existence.
However, when they failed to reach a satisfying conclusion, many eventually gave up on their search for God.
Indeed, Satan has “blinded the minds of the unbelievers. ”
Little wonder that the majority of mankind are left in ignorance and confusion as to the truth about the Father, the Creator of the universe! ​ — Isa.
45: 18.
(a) Who has revealed the Creator to us?
(b) What questions are we going to consider?
Yet, it is vital that people learn the truth about God.
Because only those who call “on the name of Jehovah ” will be saved.
To call on God’s name involves becoming acquainted with Jehovah as a Person.
He revealed the Father to them. (Read Luke 10: 22.)
Why was Jesus able to reveal the Father as no one else could?
How did Jesus do so?
And how can we imitate Jesus in revealing the Father to others?
Let us consider these questions.
JESUS CHRIST ​ — UNIQUELY QUALIFIED
4, 5.
Why was Jesus in a unique position to reveal his Father?
Jesus was especially qualified to reveal his Father.
Because before all other forms of life were created, the spirit creature who later became the man Jesus already existed in heaven as “the only - begotten Son of God. ”
What a unique position!
While no other creature existed, the Son basked in the warmth of his Father’s attention and learned about Him and His qualities.
The Father and Son must have communicated extensively and developed deep affection for each other over aeons of time.
What a wealth of insight into his Father’s personality the Son must have gained! ​ — Read Colossians 1: 15 - 17.
The Father designated the Son to be His spokesman, “The Word of God. ”
Therefore, Jesus was in a unique position to reveal the Father to others.
Appropriately, Gospel writer John describes Jesus, “the Word, ” as being“ in the bosom position with the Father. ”
One guest would recline right in front of another person on the same couch.
Being close together, these two could easily engage in conversation.
So the Son, being “in the bosom position, ” had intimate conversations with his Father.
6, 7.
How did the relationship between the Father and the Son keep developing?
The Son “came to be the one [God] was specially fond of day by day. ” (Read Proverbs 8: 22, 23, 30, 31.)
It is logical, then, that the bond between the two became stronger as they worked together and as the Son learned to imitate his Father’s qualities.
With the creation of other intelligent creatures, the Son saw how Jehovah dealt with each one, and his appreciation for God’s personality surely deepened.
Even the challenge that Satan later launched against the rightfulness of Jehovah’s sovereignty gave the Son an opportunity to learn how Jehovah would exercise love, justice, wisdom, and power when He was confronted with a difficult situation.
This would, in turn, no doubt have prepared Jesus to cope with the difficulties that he himself later encountered in his ministry on earth. ​ — John 5: 19.
How do the Gospel accounts help us to learn much about the Father’s qualities?
Because of his close relationship with Jehovah, the Son explained the Father in richer detail than anyone else could ever do.
What better way could there be for us to come to know the Father than by considering what his only - begotten Son taught and did?
To illustrate, think how difficult it would be for us to come to appreciate fully what the word “love ” means by merely reading a dictionary definition.
Yet, by reflecting on the vivid accounts of the Gospel writers about Jesus ’ ministry and his ways of caring for others, we can gain much insight into the statement “God is love. ”
The same is true of God’s other qualities that Jesus revealed to his disciples while he was on earth.
HOW JESUS REVEALED HIS FATHER
(a) In what two basic ways did Jesus reveal his Father?
(b) Give an example that shows how Jesus revealed his Father through his teaching.
How did Jesus reveal the Father to his disciples and by extension to his future followers?
Let us first consider Jesus ’ teachings.
What Jesus taught his followers reflected his deep insight into his Father’s thoughts, feelings, and ways.
For example, Jesus likened his Father to a caring owner of a flock who goes off to look for one stray sheep. Jesus said that when the owner finds the lost sheep, “he rejoices more over it than over the ninety - nine that have not strayed. ”
What was the application of that illustration?
“Likewise, ” Jesus explained,“ it is not a desirable thing with my Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish. ”
What can you learn about Jehovah from this illustration?
Even if you at times feel that you are of little value and are forgotten, your heavenly Father is interested in you and cares for you. In his eyes, you are one of “these little ones. ”
How did Jesus reveal his Father through his own conduct?
The second way in which Jesus revealed the Father to his disciples was by means of his conduct.
So when the apostle Philip asked Jesus: “Show us the Father, ” Jesus could rightly say:“ He that has seen me has seen the Father also. ”
Consider some examples of how Jesus demonstrated his Father’s qualities.
When a leper begged Jesus to cure him, Jesus touched the man who was “full of leprosy ” and told him:“ I want to. Be made clean. ”
Upon being cured, the leper no doubt could see Jehovah’s hand in what Jesus did.
Also, at the time of Lazarus ’ death, the disciples must have felt the Father’s compassion when Jesus “groaned in the spirit and became troubled ” and“ gave way to tears. ”
Though Jesus knew that he was going to resurrect Lazarus, he felt the pain that was evident among Lazarus ’ family and friends.
You no doubt have your favorite Bible accounts that enable you to see the merciful Father as exemplified by Jesus ’ actions.
(a) When Jesus cleansed the temple, what did he reveal about his Father?
(b) Why is the account of Jesus ’ cleansing of the temple reassuring to us?
However, what conclusion do you draw from Jesus ’ cleansing of the temple?
Visualize the scene: Jesus made a whip of ropes, and he drove out those selling cattle and sheep. He scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
That forceful action made the disciples recall the prophetic words of King David: “Sheer zeal for your house has eaten me up. ”
By taking firm action, Jesus showed a strong desire to defend true worship.
Do you see in that account the Father’s personality?
It reminds us that God has not only the unlimited power to wipe wickedness from the face of the earth but also the ardent desire to do so.
This depiction of Jesus ’ strong reaction to wrongdoing reveals how the Father must feel as he looks at the wickedness that is rampant on earth today.
How reassuring that is to us when we are coping with injustices!
12, 13.
What can you learn about Jehovah from the way Jesus treated his disciples?
Let us consider another example ​ — the way Jesus treated his disciples.
They kept arguing about who was greater.
From his long experience with the Father, Jesus knew how Jehovah feels about such prideful tendencies.
Moreover, Jesus had seen such inclinations manifested by Satan the Devil.
That egotistic individual cared greatly about prominence and position.
Hence, how grieved Jesus must have been to see an ambitious attitude continue among the disciples he had trained! It was even found among the ones he had chosen as apostles!
They showed an ambitious attitude until the very last day of Jesus ’ life on earth.
Yet, Jesus kept on reproving them with kindness, without ever losing hope that they would eventually learn to imitate his own humble mental attitude. ​ — Phil. 2: 5 - 8.
Can you see the Father’s hand in the way Jesus patiently corrected wrong tendencies in his disciples?
Do you see in Jesus ’ actions and words the Father, who does not forsake his people despite their repeated failures?
With that knowledge of God’s qualities in mind, are we not motivated to approach him to express our repentance when we make mistakes?
THE SON WILLINGLY REVEALED HIS FATHER
How did Jesus show that he was willing to reveal his Father?
In contrast, Jesus was willing to share the information he had about the Father, revealing Him fully to others. (Read Matthew 11: 27.)
In addition, Jesus gave his disciples “intellectual capacity that [they might] gain the knowledge of the true one, ” Jehovah God.
What does that mean?
Jesus opened up his followers ’ minds so that they could understand his teachings about the Father.
He did not hide his Father in a cloud of mystery by teaching that He was part of an incomprehensible Trinity.
Why did Jesus hold back some information about his Father?
Did Jesus reveal everything that he knew about his Father?
(Read John 16: 12.)
Because at the time, his disciples were “not able to bear ” such knowledge.
As Jesus explained, though, a great deal of knowledge would be revealed upon the arrival of “the helper, ” the holy spirit, that would guide them“ into all the truth. ”
Just as wise parents may withhold some information from their children until the children become old enough to understand, so Jesus waited until the disciples became mature and able to comprehend certain facts about the Father.
Jesus kindly took into account their limitations.
IMITATE JESUS BY HELPING OTHERS TO KNOW JEHOVAH
16, 17.
Why are you in a position to reveal the Father to others?
When you come to know someone well and appreciate his loving personality, are you not moved to tell others about him?
When on earth, Jesus talked about his Father.
Is it possible for us to imitate him in revealing Jehovah to others?
As we have considered, Jesus had far deeper knowledge of his Father than others did.
Yet, he was willing to share some of what he knew, even giving his followers the intellectual capacity for grasping deeper aspects of God’s personality.
With the help of Jesus, have we not come to appreciate our Father in a way that most people today do not?
How grateful we are that Jesus through his teachings and conduct willingly revealed his Father to us!
In fact, we may properly boast in knowing the Father.
As we have striven to draw close to Jehovah, he has drawn close to us.
Therefore, we are now in a position to share our knowledge with others.
How can we do that?
18, 19.
In what ways can you reveal the Father to others?
Explain. We need to imitate Jesus by revealing the Father by our words and deeds.
Keep in mind that many we meet in field service do not know who God is.
Their view of God may be obscured by false teachings.
We may share with them what we know about God’s name, his purpose for humans, and his personality as revealed in the Bible.
Moreover, we may discuss with fellow believers some Bible accounts that reveal God’s personality in a way that we did not appreciate before.
That way, they too may benefit.
How about revealing the Father by your conduct as you strive to imitate Jesus?
When people see in our actions the love of Christ, they will be drawn to the Father as well as to Jesus.
The apostle Paul encouraged us to ‘ become imitators of him, even as he was of Christ. ’
What a wonderful privilege we have of helping people to see Jehovah in the way we conduct ourselves!
Yes, may we all keep on imitating Jesus by revealing the Father to others.
Betrayal ​ — An Ominous Sign of the Times!
“How loyal and righteous and unblamable we proved to be. ” ​ — 1 THESS.
2: 10.
ISOLATE THESE MAIN POINTS:
What warning lessons can we learn from the betrayals committed by Delilah, Absalom, and Judas Iscariot?
How can we imitate the loyalty displayed by both Jonathan and Peter?
How can we remain steadfast in our loyalty to our marriage mate and to Jehovah?
1 - 3. (a) What is an ominous sign of the times, and what does it involve?
(b) What three questions will we answer?
WHAT do Delilah, Absalom, and Judas Iscariot have in common?
They were all disloyal ​ — Delilah to the man who loved her, Judge Samson; Absalom to his father, King David; Judas to his Master, Christ Jesus.
In each case, their deplorable actions wreaked havoc on others!
But why should this be of concern to us?
A modern - day author lists betrayal among today’s most common vices.
That is to be expected.
When giving the sign of “the conclusion of the system of things, ” Jesus said:“ Many... will betray one another. ”
“To betray ” means“ to give up to, or place in the power of an enemy, by treachery or disloyalty. ”
Such a lack of loyalty confirms that we are living in “the last days ” when, Paul foretold, people would be“ disloyal,... betrayers. ”
Even though authors and screenwriters often dramatize and romanticize treacherous acts in literature and in the movies, in real life disloyalty and betrayal cause pain and suffering.
Indeed, such acts are an ominous sign of the times!
What lessons can we learn from the Bible about those who were disloyal in the past?
What examples of people who proved their devotion to others can we imitate?
And to whom must we remain steadfast in our loyalty?
WARNING EXAMPLES FROM THE PAST
How did Delilah betray Samson, and why was that so contemptible?
First, consider conniving Delilah, with whom Judge Samson had fallen in love.
Samson was intent on leading the fight against the Philistines on behalf of God’s people.
Perhaps knowing that Delilah had no loyal love for Samson, the five Philistine lords offered her a large bribe to find out the secret of his superior strength so that they could eliminate him.
Mercenary Delilah accepted their offer, but her attempts to uncover Samson’s secret failed three times.
She then kept on pressuring him “with her words all the time and kept urging him. ” Finally,“ his soul got to be impatient to the point of dying. ”
So he told her that his hair had never been cut and that if it was, he would lose his power.
* Knowing that, Delilah had Samson’s hair shaved off while he was asleep on her lap, and then she turned him over to his enemies to do to him whatever they wanted.
How contemptible her action was!
All because of her greed, Delilah betrayed someone who loved her.
(a) How did Absalom prove disloyal to David, and what did that expose about him?
(b) How did David feel about Ahithophel’s having turned traitor?
Next, consider treacherous Absalom.
Inflamed with ambition, he was determined to usurp the throne of his father, King David.
Absalom first ‘ stole the hearts of the men of Israel ’ by ingratiating himself with them, using sly promises and insincere expressions of affection.
He would embrace and kiss them, as if he were truly interested in them and their needs.
Absalom even won over David’s trusted confidant Ahithophel, who turned traitor and joined the coup.
In Psalms 3 and 55, David describes how such disloyalty affected him.
How did Judas betray Jesus, and with what has Judas ’ name become synonymous? Now think of what traitorous Judas Iscariot did to the Christ.
At the last Passover that Jesus celebrated with his 12 apostles, he told them: “Truly I say to you, One of you will betray me. ”
Later that night, Jesus announced to Peter, James, and John in the garden of Gethsemane: “Look!
My betrayer has drawn near. ”
Immediately, Judas appeared in the garden with his coconspirators, “and going straight up to Jesus he said: ‘ Good day, Rabbi! ’
and kissed him very tenderly. ”
Judas “betrayed righteous blood ” and handed Jesus over to Christ’s enemies.
And for what did money - loving Judas do that?
For a mere 30 pieces of silver!
The name Judas has been synonymous with “traitor ” ever since, especially one who betrays another under the guise of friendship.
* What lessons have we learned from the lives of (a) Absalom and Judas and (b) Delilah?
What have we learned from these warning examples?
Absalom and Judas both met a shameful end because of their having turned traitor against the anointed of Jehovah.
Delilah’s name will forever be associated with treachery and feigned love.
How vital it is that we reject any tendency we may have toward blind ambition or greed, which would cause us to lose Jehovah’s favor!
Could any lessons be more powerful to help us reject the loathsome trait of disloyalty?
IMITATE THOSE WHO PROVED LOYAL
8, 9. (a) Why did Jonathan pledge his loyalty to David?
(b) How can we imitate Jonathan?
The Bible also describes many loyal individuals.
Let us consider two of these and see what we can learn from them, starting with a man who proved his loyalty to David.
Jonathan, King Saul’s eldest son, would likely have been the heir to the throne of Israel ​ — except for one thing.
Jehovah chose David to be Israel’s next king.
Jonathan respected God’s decision. He did not jealously view David as a rival.
Rather, Jonathan’s “soul became bound up with the soul of David ” as he pledged his loyalty to him.
He even gave David his garments, sword, bow, and belt, thus bestowing royal honors on him.
Jonathan did all he could to ‘ strengthen David’s hand, ’ even to the point of risking his own life to stand up for David in front of Saul.
Jonathan loyally told David: “You yourself will be king over Israel, and I myself shall become second to you. ”
It is no wonder that after Jonathan’s death, David expressed his sorrow and his love for him in a mournful song. ​ — 2 Sam.
1: 17, 26.
There was no conflict of loyalties on Jonathan’s part.
He was completely submissive to the Sovereign, Jehovah, and he fully supported David as the anointed of God.
Likewise today, even if we may not have been given a special privilege in the congregation, we should willingly support the brothers who have been appointed to take the lead among us. ​ — 1 Thess. 5: 12, 13; Heb.
13: 17, 24. 10, 11. (a) Why did Peter loyally stay with Jesus?
(b) How can we imitate Peter, and what should we be moved to do?
The other good example we will consider is that of the apostle Peter, who avowed his loyalty to Jesus.
When Christ used graphic, figurative language to emphasize the importance of exercising faith in his soon - to - be - sacrificed flesh and blood, many of his disciples found his words shocking, and they left him.
So Jesus turned to his 12 apostles and asked: “You do not want to go also, do you? ”
It was Peter who responded: “Lord, whom shall we go away to?
You have sayings of everlasting life; and we have believed and come to know that you are the Holy One of God. ”
Did this mean that Peter fully understood all that Jesus had just said about His coming sacrifice?
Even so, Peter was determined to be loyal to God’s anointed Son.
Peter did not reason that Jesus must have the wrong view of things and that if given time, He would recant what He had said.
No, Peter humbly recognized that Jesus had “sayings of everlasting life. ”
Likewise today, how do we react if we encounter a point in our Christian publications from “the faithful steward ” that is hard to understand or that does not match with our thinking?
We should try hard to get the sense of it rather than merely expecting that there will be a change to conform to our viewpoint. ​ — Read Luke 12: 42.
REMAIN LOYAL TO YOUR MARRIAGE MATE
12, 13.
How might betrayal find a niche in a marriage, and why is a person’s age not an excuse for that to happen?
Betrayal in any form is a vile act that must not be allowed to disrupt the peace and unity of the Christian family and the congregation.
With that in mind, let us consider how we can be steadfast in our loyalty to our marriage mate and to our God.
Adultery is one of the most devastating forms of betrayal. The adulterer has violated his fidelity to his marriage mate and shifted his attention to another person.
The betrayed mate is suddenly left alone ​ — with a life that is turned upside down.
How does that happen between two people who once loved each other?
Often, a first step in that direction is taken when marriage mates become emotionally distant from each other.
Professor of Sociology Gabriella Turnaturi explains that alternating “between being fully present in a relationship and not being fully present is where betrayal finds its niche. ”
This distancing of oneself from a marriage mate has happened to some even during middle age.
For example, a 50 - year - old married man divorces his faithful wife of 25 years in order to join up with another woman to whom he has become attracted.
Some excuse this as a midlife crisis.
However, rather than making it sound as though it were unavoidable, let us call it what it really is ​ — a midlife betrayal.
(a) How does Jehovah feel about treachery in a marriage?
(b) What did Jesus say about marital fidelity?
How does Jehovah feel about those who leave their mates without a Scriptural reason?
Our God ‘ hates a divorcing, ’ and he has uttered strong words against those who abuse and abandon their marriage mates.
(Read Malachi 2: 13 - 16.)
In heart harmony with his Father, Jesus taught that one cannot drive away or cast off an innocent mate and act as if nothing has happened. ​ — Read Matthew 19: 3 - 6, 9.
How can those who are married strengthen their loyalty to their mates?
How can those who are married remain loyal to their mates?
God’s Word says: “Rejoice with the wife [or husband] of your youth ” and,“ See life with the wife [or husband] whom you love. ”
As both mates grow older, they must be “fully present ” in their relationship, both physically and emotionally.
That means being attentive to each other, spending time with each other, and drawing closer to each other.
They have to focus on preserving their marriage and their relationship with Jehovah.
To that end, couples need to study the Bible together, regularly work in the ministry together, and pray together for Jehovah’s blessing.
REMAIN LOYAL TO JEHOVAH
16, 17. (a) How might our loyalty to God be put on the line in the family and the congregation?
(b) What example illustrates that obeying God’s command to quit associating with disfellowshipped relatives can lead to good results?
There are members of the congregation who committed serious sins and who were reproved “with severity, that they may be healthy in the faith. ”
For some, their conduct has required that they be disfellowshipped.
For “those who have been trained by it, ” the discipline has helped them to become spiritually restored.
What if we have a relative or a close friend who is disfellowshipped?
Now our loyalty is on the line, not to that person, but to God.
Jehovah is watching us to see whether we will abide by his command not to have contact with anyone who is disfellowshipped. ​ — Read 1 Corinthians 5: 11 - 13.
Consider just one example of the good that can come when a family loyally upholds Jehovah’s decree not to associate with disfellowshipped relatives.
A young man had been disfellowshipped for over ten years, during which time his father, mother, and four brothers “quit mixing in company ” with him.
At times, he tried to involve himself in their activities, but to their credit, each member of the family was steadfast in not having any contact with him.
After he was reinstated, he said that he always missed the association with his family, especially at night when he was alone.
But, he admitted, had the family associated with him even a little, that small dose would have satisfied him.
However, because he did not receive even the slightest communication from any of his family, the burning desire to be with them became one motivating factor in his restoring his relationship with Jehovah.
Think of that if you are ever tempted to violate God’s command not to associate with your disfellowshipped relatives.
After having reviewed the merits of loyalty versus the consequences of disloyalty, what is your resolve?
We live in a treacherous, disloyal world.
Yet, all around us in the Christian congregation, we can find loyal examples to imitate.
Their life course speaks for them, as if to say: “You are witnesses, God is also, how loyal and righteous and unblamable we proved to be to you believers. ”
May we all remain ever steadfast in our loyalty to God and to one another.
Not the hair itself, but what it stood for, that is, Samson’s special relationship with Jehovah as a Nazirite, was the source of his strength.
Hence, the term “Judas kiss ” means“ an act of betrayal. ”
For help in dealing with a marriage mate’s disloyalty, see the article “Coping With a Spouse’s Betrayal, ” in the June 15, 2010, issue of The Watchtower, pages 29 - 32.
[Picture on page 10]
Peter was loyal to God’s anointed Son even though others rejected Him
Maintain a Complete Heart Toward Jehovah
“My son, know the God of your father and serve him with a complete heart. ” ​ — 1 CHRON.
28: 9.
LOOK FOR THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS:
What is the figurative heart?
What method can we use to examine our heart?
How can we keep our heart complete toward Jehovah?
1, 2. (a) What part of the body is referred to figuratively in God’s Word more often than any other?
(b) Why is it important that we understand the meaning of the figurative heart?
For instance, the patriarch Job stated: “There is no violence upon my palms. ”
King Solomon observed: “A report that is good makes the bones fat. ” Jehovah assured Ezekiel:“ Harder than flint, I have made your forehead. ”
And the apostle Paul was told: “You are introducing some things that are strange to our ears. ” ​ — Job 16: 17; Prov.
15: 30; Ezek.
3: 9; Acts 17: 20.
One part of the human body, though, is referred to figuratively in the Bible far more often than any other.
It is the one mentioned in a prayer by faithful Hannah: “My heart does exult in Jehovah. ”
In fact, Bible writers mention the heart nearly a thousand times, almost always in a figurative sense.
It is of utmost importance that we understand what the heart represents because the Bible states that we need to safeguard it. ​ — Read Proverbs 4: 23.
THE FIGURATIVE HEART ​ — WHAT IS IT?
How can we discern the meaning of “heart ” in the Bible?
Though God’s Word does not provide a dictionary definition of the word “heart, ” it allows us to discern the meaning of that word.
To illustrate, think of an exquisite wall mosaic that is made up of a thousand closely set small pebbles.
By stepping back to look at the entire mosaic, one sees that all the carefully placed pebbles together form a pattern, or picture.
Similarly, if we were to step back and look at the many instances where “heart ” is used in the Bible, we could discern that taken together these references form a pattern, or picture.
What picture?
(a) What does “heart ” represent?
(b) What is the meaning of Jesus ’ words as recorded at Matthew 22: 37?
It encompasses such aspects as our desires, thoughts, disposition, attitudes, capabilities, motivations, and goals. (Read Deuteronomy 15: 7; Proverbs 16: 9; Acts 2: 26.)
As one reference work states, it is “the sum total of the interior man. ”
In some cases, “heart ” has a narrower meaning.
For example, Jesus said: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind. ”
In this instance, “heart ” refers to the emotions, desires, and feelings of the inner person.
By mentioning heart, soul, and mind separately, Jesus emphasized that we must express our love for God in our feelings as well as by the way we lead our life and use our mental faculties.
But when “heart ” is mentioned by itself, it stands for the total inner person.
WHY WE NEED TO GUARD OUR HEART
Why do we want to do our utmost to serve Jehovah with a complete heart?
Regarding the heart, King David reminded Solomon: “My son, know the God of your father and serve him with a complete heart and with a delightful soul; for all hearts Jehovah is searching, and every inclination of the thoughts he is discerning. ”
Indeed, Jehovah is the Examiner of all hearts, including ours.
And what he finds in our heart has a strong bearing on our relationship with him and on our future.
Thus, we have good reason to follow David’s inspired counsel by doing our utmost to serve Jehovah with a complete heart.
What should we realize about our resolve to serve Jehovah?
Our zealous activities as Jehovah’s people show that we have, indeed, a deep desire to serve God with a complete heart.
At the same time, we realize that the pressures of Satan’s wicked world and the sinful inclinations of our own flesh are powerful forces that can undermine our resolve to serve God wholeheartedly.
Hence, to check that our resolve to serve God is not weakening ​ — that we are not letting our guard down — ​ we need to peer regularly into our heart.
What demonstrates the condition of our heart?
Obviously, our inner personality is unseen ​ — much as the core, or heart, of a tree cannot be seen.
Still, as Jesus mentioned in the Sermon on the Mount, just as fruits reveal the condition of a tree, so our activities demonstrate the true condition of our heart.
Let us consider one such outward action.
A TANGIBLE METHOD FOR EXAMINING OUR HEART
Jesus ’ words found at Matthew 6: 33 have what relationship to what is in our heart?
Earlier, in the same sermon, Jesus told his listeners what specific action on their part would demonstrate their inner desire to serve Jehovah wholeheartedly.
He said: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you. ” Indeed, by what we put first in our life, we make manifest what we are desiring, thinking, and planning deep down in our heart.
Examining our priorities in life is thus a tangible way to check whether we are serving God with a complete heart.
What invitation did Jesus extend to some men, and what was revealed by their reactions?
Not long after Jesus urged his followers to “keep on... seeking first the kingdom, ” an incident happened that illustrates how a man’s heart condition is indeed revealed by what he puts first in life.
Gospel writer Luke introduces the incident by stating that Jesus “firmly set his face to go to Jerusalem ” even though he well knew what eventually awaited him there.
While he and his apostles “were going on the road, ” Jesus met some men to whom he extended the invitation:“ Be my follower. ”
Those men were willing to accept Jesus ’ invitation ​ — but on certain conditions.
One man replied: “Permit me first to leave and bury my father. ”
Another said: “I will follow you, Lord; but first permit me to say good - bye to those in my household. ”
What a contrast there was between Jesus ’ firm, wholehearted resolve and those men’s weak, conditional offers!
By placing their own concerns first, above Kingdom interests, they revealed that their heart was not complete toward God.
(a) How have Christ’s followers reacted to Jesus ’ invitation?
(b) Jesus related what brief illustration?
Unlike those would - be disciples, we have wisely accepted Jesus ’ invitation to be his followers and are now serving Jehovah every day.
In this way, we demonstrate how we feel in our heart about Jehovah.
Yet, even though we are active in the congregation, we still need to be aware of a potential risk to our heart condition.
In the same conversation with those would - be disciples, Jesus revealed that danger, saying: “No man that has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is well fitted for the kingdom of God. ”
What lesson can we draw from that illustration?
DO WE “CLING TO WHAT IS GOOD ”?
