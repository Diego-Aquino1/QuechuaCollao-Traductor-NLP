Particularly from the 18th century on, however, critics of the Bible have attacked the authenticity of the book of Isaiah.
They have claimed that Isaiah’s prophecies were not truly predictive but were written after the fact, a later writer merely recording what had already happened.
Is that true?
In 1947 a copy of the book of Isaiah was discovered, along with other ancient scrolls, in a cave near the Dead Sea.
Scholars determined that this copy was made more than a hundred years before the birth of the foretold Messiah, or Christ. Yes, the Bible revealed the future!
Isaiah and other Bible writers could not have foretold future events based solely on their own insight.
Rather, they “spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit. ”
In the following articles, we will focus on some details of Jesus ’ life that were foretold through Isaiah.
Then we will consider events that Jesus and his disciples foretold for our day and beyond.
Foretelling the Messiah
KNOWING what Isaiah and other prophets had written about the Messiah, the Jewish nation long anticipated his arrival.
By Jesus ’ day, in fact, many Jews “were in expectation ” of the Messiah’s imminent appearance.
Significantly, Bible prophecies include remarkable details of the Messiah’s life.
No mere human could either foretell such events or arrange for Jesus to experience them.
Details Surrounding the Messiah’s Birth.
Isaiah foretold that the Messiah, or Christ, would be born of a virgin.
After describing the miraculous circumstances of Jesus ’ birth, the apostle Matthew wrote: “All this actually came about for that to be fulfilled which was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet, saying: ‘ Look!
The virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son. ’ ”
Isaiah also foretold that Christ would be a descendant of David, specifically mentioning Jesse, David’s father.
Jesus did indeed directly descend from David.
Thus, before the birth of Jesus, the angel Gabriel told Jesus ’ mother, Mary: “God will give him the throne of David his father. ” ​ — Luke 1: 32, 33; Isaiah 11: 1 - 5, 10; Romans 15: 12.
Details of the Messiah’s Life.
In the synagogue in Nazareth, the adult Jesus read aloud from Isaiah’s prophecy, including these words: “Jehovah’s spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor. ”
Applying the prophecy to himself, Jesus stated: “Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled. ”
Isaiah also foretold Jesus ’ kind, mild, and unassuming way of dealing with those in need of healing.
Matthew writes: “Many also followed him, and he cured them all, but he strictly charged them not to make him manifest; that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet...
‘ He will not wrangle, nor cry aloud...
No bruised reed will he crush. ’ ” ​ — Matthew 8: 16, 17; 12: 10 - 21; Isaiah 42: 1 - 4; 53: 4, 5.
Details of the Messiah’s Suffering.
Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah would not be accepted by the majority in Israel but would instead become “a stone of stumbling ” to them.
And indeed, despite Jesus ’ many miracles, the people “were not putting faith in him, so that the word of Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled which he said: ‘ Jehovah, who has put faith in the thing heard by us? ’ ”
Contributing to the Jews ’ lack of faith was the popular, though mistaken, belief that the Messiah would immediately rid the nation of Roman rule and restore an independent Davidic kingdom on earth.
Because Jesus suffered and died, most Jews could not accept him as the Messiah.
But, in fact, Isaiah had foretold that the Messiah would experience suffering before becoming King.
In the book of Isaiah, the Messiah prophetically says: “My back I gave to the strikers...
My face I did not conceal from humiliating things and spit. ”
Matthew reports what happened when Jesus was being tried: “They spit into his face and hit him with their fists.
Others slapped him in the face. ”
“He was letting himself be afflicted; yet he would not open his mouth, ” wrote Isaiah.
Thus, when Pilate questioned Jesus about the Jews ’ accusations, Jesus “did not answer him, no, not a word, so that the governor wondered very much. ” ​ — Isaiah 53: 7; Matthew 27: 12 - 14; Acts 8: 28, 32 - 35.
Details of the Messiah’s Death.
Isaiah’s prophecy continued to be fulfilled at Jesus ’ death and even afterward.
Isaiah foretold: “He will make his burial place even with the wicked ones, and with the rich class in his death. ”
How could this apparently contradictory prophecy be fulfilled?
When Jesus died, he was impaled between two robbers.
But later, wealthy Joseph of Arimathea laid Jesus ’ body in his own newly quarried tomb.
Finally, Jesus ’ death fulfilled one of the most important elements of Isaiah’s prophecy.
Speaking of the Messiah, Isaiah says: “The righteous one, my servant, will bring a righteous standing to many people; and their errors he himself will bear. ”
Indeed, Jesus ’ death provided the ransom so that the burden of sin can be lifted from all faithful people. ​ — Isaiah 53: 8, 11; Romans 4: 25.
Prophecies Certain of Fulfillment
To establish the identity of the Messiah Scripturally, the apostles and Jesus himself quoted more frequently from the prophecy of Isaiah than from any other Bible book.
Still, the book of Isaiah was not the only one to foretell the future.
Many other Hebrew Scripture prophecies also find fulfillment in Jesus, his Kingdom, and the good things that the Kingdom will accomplish in the future.
* How certain was it that these prophecies would be fulfilled?
Jesus told his Jewish listeners: “Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets [that is, the Hebrew Scriptures].
I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill; for truly I say to you that sooner would heaven and earth pass away than for one smallest letter or one particle of a letter to pass away from the Law by any means and not all things take place. ” ​ — Matthew 5: 17, 18.
Jesus also pointed to the fulfillment of Bible prophecies in the events unfolding around him and in events to come.
Further, Jesus and his disciples themselves foretold events that would occur after their day, including many that we have seen take place today.
The following article will discuss these and other, yet future, fulfillments of Bible prophecy.

Events Foretold for Our Day
THE Bible foretells that God’s Kingdom will bring permanent peace and happiness to the earth.
In the Our Father, or the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus taught his disciples to pray: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth. ”
In his great prophecy given to his disciples on the Mount of Olives, Jesus foretold specific events and conditions that would immediately precede the coming of that Kingdom.
Together, these features constitute a sign that would be clearly evident to all honesthearted observers.
How many of the following aspects of that sign are you personally aware of?
International Wars.
Jesus foretold: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. ”
Prior to the first world war in 1914, wars tended to be more localized.
World War I not only engulfed large parts of the globe but also accelerated the development of weapons more terrible than any that mankind had ever known.
For example, the newly invented airplane was used to drop bombs on civilians.
Mass production of weapons increased the carnage to levels that were previously unimaginable, as about half of the 65 million soldiers that were mobilized either died or were wounded.
Yet, as the 20th century progressed, the carnage expanded.
In the words of one historian, the military and civilian dead of World War II “would be forever uncountable. ”
And the wars continue even now.
Widespread Hunger.
“There will be food shortages, ” Jesus foretold. In 2005, Science magazine stated:“ There are 854 million people in the world (about 14% of our population) who are chronically or acutely malnourished. ”
In 2007, a United Nations source reported that 33 countries lack sufficient food to feed their people.
When world grain production is on the rise, how can this be?
For one thing, land and grain that could be used to feed people are used to produce ethanol instead.
“The amount of ethanol needed to fill a big four - wheel - drive SUV just once uses enough grain to feed one person for an entire year, ” reports the South African newspaper The Witness. In developed countries too, increasing food prices force many to choose between having food for dinner or paying for other necessities, such as medicine or heating.
Massive Earthquakes.
Jesus said: “There will be great earthquakes. ”
If it seems to you that now more people than ever before are affected by earthquakes, you are correct.
“Suddenly we are seeing a spurt in seismic activity globally, ” observed Indian seismologist R.
K. Chadha in 2007. “Nobody knows why. ”
Moreover, rapid population growth in areas prone to earthquakes has increased the toll of these disasters.
The earthquake that struck the Indian Ocean in 2004 and the tsunami that followed made that year the “deadliest in nearly 500 years for earthquakes ” and“ the second most fatal in recorded history, ” according to the U.S.
Geological Survey.
Intractable Disease.
“There will be... pestilences, ” Jesus foretold.
Around the globe, illnesses old and new sicken ever greater numbers, and hoped - for remedies are proving elusive.
For instance, international goals to eradicate malaria have had to be scaled back repeatedly as the disease continues to defy human control.
In addition, millions are killed by old diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), now operating in tandem with AIDS and other new diseases.
“One - third of the world’s population is currently infected with the TB bacillus, ” reports the World Health Organization.
The organization also notes that HIV is contributing to the TB epidemics in many countries.
Every second, another person is infected with TB, and TB is developing greater resistance to drug treatment.
In 2007 a patient in Europe was diagnosed with TB that was “invulnerable to every single drug we have, ” reported New Scientist magazine.
Moral and Social Breakdown.
“Because of the increasing of lawlessness the love of the greater number will cool off, ” Jesus said.
Besides what Jesus foretold, the apostle Paul pointed forward to a collapse of social and moral values.
He described the difficult “last days ” that would come just before God’s Kingdom would end this world system.
“Men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self - assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self - control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power. ”
Have you not seen that people display such bad traits more than they used to?
Jesus and Paul did not list all the historical, social, and political factors that are to blame for these world conditions.
Nevertheless, their prophecies accurately foretold the events and attitudes that we are seeing today.
What about the future?
The prophecy of Isaiah that reliably foretold the coming of the Messiah also describes the beneficial changes God’s Kingdom will bring to the earth.
Let us consider these in the following article.

Foretelling Our Immediate Future
WHEN discussing the future of man and the earth, the apostle Peter wrote: “There are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his [God’s] promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell. ”
A promise of “new heavens and a new earth ” was originally given through the prophet Isaiah.
By citing this prophecy, Peter showed that in his time it had not yet been completely fulfilled.
Later, about the year 96 C.E., the Revelation given through the apostle John associated that “new earth ” with blessings under God’s Kingdom.
Jesus ’ words as well as those of the apostle Paul about world conditions just prior to the coming of God’s Kingdom are now being fulfilled.
Therefore, we can expect that Kingdom will soon usher in the new world.
What will that new world be like?
The Bible book of Isaiah tells us.
Blessings in the New World
Worldwide Peace and United Worship.
“They will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears.
Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore. ” ​ — Isaiah 2: 2 - 4.
Peace Between Humans and Animals.
“The wolf will actually reside for a while with the male lamb, and with the kid the leopard itself will lie down, and the calf and the maned young lion and the well - fed animal all together; and a mere little boy will be leader over them.
And the cow and the bear themselves will feed; together their young ones will lie down.
And even the lion will eat straw just like the bull....
They will not do any harm or cause any ruin in all my holy mountain; because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea. ” ​ — Isaiah 11: 6 - 9.
Abundant Food for All.
“Jehovah of armies will certainly make for all the peoples, in this mountain, a banquet of well - oiled dishes, a banquet of wine kept on the dregs, of well - oiled dishes filled with marrow, of wine kept on the dregs, filtered. ” ​ — Isaiah 25: 6.
No More Death.
“He [God] will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces.
And the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for Jehovah himself has spoken it. ” ​ — Isaiah 25: 8.
Dead Ones Resurrected.
“Thy dead live, their bodies will rise again.
They that sleep in the earth will awake and shout for joy...
The earth will bring those long dead to birth again. ” ​ — Isaiah 26: 19, The New English Bible.
Messiah a Righteous Judge.
“He will not judge by any mere appearance to his eyes, nor reprove simply according to the thing heard by his ears.
And with righteousness he must judge the lowly ones, and with uprightness he must give reproof in behalf of the meek ones of the earth. ” ​ — Isaiah 11: 3, 4.
Blind and Deaf Healed.
“The eyes of the blind ones will be opened, and the very ears of the deaf ones will be unstopped. ” ​ — Isaiah 35: 5.
Wasteland Becomes Productive.
“The wilderness and the waterless region will exult, and the desert plain will be joyful and blossom as the saffron.
Without fail it will blossom, and it will really be joyful with joyousness and with glad crying out. ” ​ — Isaiah 35: 1, 2.
A New Earth.
“I am creating new heavens [a new heavenly government] and a new earth [a righteous new human society]; and the former things will not be called to mind, neither will they come up into the heart.
But exult, you people, and be joyful forever in what I am creating....
They [inhabitants of God’s promised new world] will certainly build houses and have occupancy; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.
They will not build and someone else have occupancy; they will not plant and someone else do the eating.
For like the days of a tree will the days of my people be; and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full.
They will not toil for nothing, nor will they bring to birth for disturbance; because they are the offspring made up of the blessed ones of Jehovah, and their descendants with them.
And it will actually occur that before they call out I myself shall answer; while they are yet speaking, I myself shall hear. ”
“‘ Just as the new heavens and the new earth that I am making are standing before me, ’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘ so the offspring of you people and the name of you people will keep standing. ’ ” ​ — Isaiah 65: 17 - 25; 66: 22.
Foretelling a Grand Future
Isaiah is not the only Bible book that foretells blessings for the future.
The Bible is filled with prophecies that describe the marvelous things that God will accomplish through his Kingdom under Christ.

Draw Close to God
“Become Imitators of God ”
Ephesians 4: 32 – 5: 2
KINDNESS. Compassion. Forgiveness.
Love. Sadly, it is rare to see people displaying such virtues today.
What about you?
Have you ever felt that your efforts to cultivate noble attributes are doomed to failure? A self - critical heart may insist that certain obstacles, such as ingrained bad habits or painful experiences from the past, make it impossible for you to develop appealing traits.
Yet, the Bible teaches this reassuring truth ​ — our Creator knows that we have within us the potential for cultivating positive qualities.
God’s Word admonishes true Christians: “Therefore, become imitators of God, as beloved children. ”
Those words are a remarkable expression of God’s confidence in his worshippers.
Jehovah God created man in His image, according to His likeness.
God thus endowed humans with qualities that mirror his own.
* Hence, when the Bible urges Christians to “become imitators of God, ” it is as if Jehovah himself were saying to them: ‘ I believe in you.
I know that despite your imperfections, you have the ability to be like me to a certain extent. ’
What are some qualities of God that we can imitate?
The surrounding verses answer.
Note that Paul prefaced the admonition to imitate God with the word “therefore. ”
This term is a connection to the preceding verse, which mentions kindness, tender compassion, and forgiveness.
Then, in the verse following the counsel to imitate God, Paul tells Christians to pursue a way of life characterized by unselfish love.
Truly, when it comes to displaying kindness, expressing warmhearted compassion, forgiving others freely, and showing love, we have the greatest example of all to imitate ​ — Jehovah God.
Why should we want to be like God?
Notice the powerful motivation inherent in Paul’s words: “Become imitators of God, as beloved children. ”
Is that not a touching thought?
Jehovah views his worshippers as children whom he dearly loves.
As a little boy may try to be just like his father, so true Christians try their best to be like their heavenly Father.
Jehovah does not force humans to imitate him. On the contrary, he has dignified us with free will.
So whether you will become an imitator of God or not is up to you.
Never forget, though, that you have within you the potential for displaying godlike qualities.
Of course, to imitate God you must first know what he is like.
The Bible can help you to learn all about the qualities and ways of the God whose matchless personality has drawn millions to become imitators of him.
Colossians 3: 9, 10 indicates that being made in God’s image has to do with personality traits.
Those who want to please God are urged to clothe themselves “with the new personality, ” which is“ made new according to the image of the One [God] who created it. ”
Teach Your Children
LET’S talk about what it means to be jealous.
Have you ever found it hard to like a person because others said that he is good, handsome, or smart?
* — Well, that is what can happen when you are jealous of someone.
Jealousy can occur in a family if parents favor one child over another.
The Bible tells about a family in which jealousy caused a big problem.
Let us consider the trouble it led to and the lesson we can learn from what happened.
Joseph was the 11th son of Jacob, and Joseph’s half brothers were jealous of him.
Do you know why? — It was because their father, Jacob, favored Joseph.
For example, Jacob had a beautiful striped coat made for Joseph.
Jacob especially loved Joseph “because he was the son of his old age ” and the first child by his beloved wife, Rachel.
The Bible says that ‘ when Joseph’s brothers saw that their father loved him the most, they hated Joseph. ’
Then one day Joseph told his family that in a dream, all of them bowed down to him, including his own father.
“His brothers grew jealous of him, ” the Bible says, and even Joseph’s father scolded him for telling about such a dream. ​ — Genesis 37: 1 - 11.
Some time later, when Joseph was 17, his brothers were many miles away caring for the family’s sheep and goats.
So Jacob sent Joseph to see how his brothers were.
Do you know what most of them wanted to do when they saw him coming? — They wanted to kill him!
But two of them, Reuben and Judah, did not want to.
When some merchants passed by on their way to Egypt, Judah said: “Let us sell him. ”
So they did. Then they killed a goat and dipped Joseph’s coat in its blood.
Later, as they showed the coat to their father, he cried out: ‘ A vicious wild beast must have eaten Joseph! ’ ​ — Genesis 37: 12 - 36.
In time, Joseph came to be favored by Pharaoh, Egypt’s ruler.
This was because with God’s help he was able to explain the meaning of two of Pharaoh’s dreams.
The first was of seven healthy cows followed by seven sick ones.
The second dream was of seven healthy ears of grain and then of seven shriveled ones.
Both dreams, Joseph said, meant that there would be seven years of good harvests followed by seven years of famine.
At Pharaoh’s direction, Joseph was put in charge of storing up food in the years of plenty to prepare for the famine.
When the famine came, Joseph’s family, who lived many miles away, needed food.
Jacob sent Joseph’s ten older brothers to Egypt to get food.
They came before Joseph, but they did not recognize him.
Without revealing who he was, Joseph tested his brothers, and he learned how sorry they were for having treated him so badly.
Then Joseph told them who he was.
How they hugged one another and rejoiced! ​ — Genesis, chapters 40 through 45.
What can you learn about jealousy from this Bible story? — Jealousy can lead to big trouble, even causing a person to want to hurt his own brother!
Let us read Acts 5: 17, 18 and Acts 7: 54 - 59 and see what jealousy caused people to do to Jesus ’ disciples. — After reading this, can you see why we must be careful about becoming jealous? —
Joseph lived to be 110 years old.
He raised children, who bore him grandchildren, and then he had great - grandchildren.
We can be sure that Joseph often taught them to love one another and to avoid giving in to jealousy. ​ — Genesis 50: 22, 23, 26.
If you are reading with a child, the dash provides a reminder to pause and encourage the child to express himself.
What does it mean to be jealous?
What did jealousy cause the brothers of Joseph to do?
Why did Joseph forgive his brothers?
What can we learn from this story?
How to Be a Good Father
“Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. ” ​ — Colossians 3: 21, The Holy Bible — ​ New International Version.
HOW can a father avoid making his children feel bitter?
It is vital that he recognize the importance of his role as a father.
“Fatherhood turns out to be a complex and unique phenomenon with huge consequences for the emotional and intellectual growth of children, ” says one journal on mental health. What is the role of a father?
In many families the father is seen primarily as the one who dispenses discipline.
Many a mother has told a misbehaving child, ‘ Just wait till your father gets home! ’
To be sure, children need balanced discipline and a measure of firmness if they are to become well - adjusted adults.
More, though, is involved in being a good father.
Sadly, not every father had a good example to help him.
Some men were raised without a father in the home.
But in other cases, men who were brought up by a rigid, austere father may tend to treat their children the same way.
How can such a father break that mold and improve his parenting skills?
There is a source of practical and trustworthy advice on how to be a good father.
The Bible contains the best advice on family life.
Its counsel is not mere theory; nor does its guidance ever work to our harm.
The Bible’s counsel reflects the wisdom of its Author, Jehovah God, who is the Originator of family life.
If you are a father, you would do well to consider what the Bible has to say about parenting.
Being a good father is important not only for the physical and emotional welfare of your children but also for their spiritual well - being.
A child who has a very loving and close relationship with his father may even find it easier to develop a close and intimate relationship with God.
After all, the Bible shows that, in a sense, Jehovah, our Creator, is a Father to us.
Let us now consider six things that children need from their father.
In each case, we will examine how applying Bible principles can help a father to fill those needs.
1 Children Need Their Father’s Love
Jehovah sets the perfect example as a Father.
Describing how God feels about Jesus, his firstborn Son, the Bible says: “The Father loves the Son. ”
On more than one occasion, Jehovah expressed love for his Son and approval of him.
When Jesus was baptized, Jehovah spoke from the heavens, saying: “You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you. ”
Jesus never doubted his Father’s love for him.
What can a human father learn from God’s example?
Never be reluctant to tell your children that you love them.
Kelvin, a father of five, says: “I have always tried to express my love for my children not only by telling them that I love them but also by showing a personal interest in each one of them.
I shared in changing their diapers and in bathing them. ”
In addition, your children need to know that they have your approval.
So do not be overly critical, constantly correcting them.
Rather, be generous with praise.
Donizete, who has two teenage girls, recommends, “A father should make a point of looking for opportunities to commend his children. ”
Knowing that they have your approval can help your children to have a healthy sense of self - worth.
That, in turn, can help them to draw closer to God.
2 Children Need a Positive Example
Jesus can do “only what he beholds the Father doing, ” says John 5: 19.
Notice that the text says that Jesus saw and practiced what his Father was “doing. ”
Children will often do the same.
For example, if the father treats his wife with respect and dignity, his son may well grow up to treat women with dignity and respect.
Not only are boys ’ attitudes affected by their father’s example but girls ’ views of men may be influenced by their father’s example.
Do your children find it difficult to apologize?
Here again, example is important.
Kelvin remembers an occasion when two of his boys broke an expensive camera.
He got so angry that he pounded a wooden table and it split in two.
Kelvin felt very bad afterward and apologized to all, including his wife, for having lost his temper.
He feels that his apology had a positive effect on his children; they do not have any difficulty in saying that they are sorry.
3 Children Need a Happy Environment
Jehovah is a “happy God. ”
Not surprisingly, his Son, Jesus, found great joy in being with his Father.
Proverbs 8: 30 sheds light on the relationship between Jesus and his Father: “I came to be beside him [the Father] as a master worker,...
I being glad [“rejoicing, ” NIV] before him all the time. ” What a warm relationship existed between Father and Son!
Your children need a happy environment.
Taking the time to play with your children can help to create such an environment.
Playing together helps parent and child to bond.
Felix agrees with that. He has a teenage son and says: “Setting aside time for recreation with my son has been very important to our relationship. We play games together, associate with friends, and visit enjoyable places.
This has strengthened our sense of family togetherness. ”
4 Children Need to Be Taught Spiritual Values
Jesus was taught by his Father.
Jesus could therefore say: “The very things I heard from him [the Father] I am speaking in the world. ”
In God’s eyes, a father is responsible for educating his children morally and spiritually.
One of your responsibilities as a father is to inculcate right principles into the hearts of your children.
Such training should start from an early age.
Felix began to read Bible stories to his son when he was still small. Felix used colorful, interesting stories, including those found in My Book of Bible Stories.
* As his son grew older, Felix chose other Bible - based publications that were appropriate for his son’s age.
Donizete says: “It is a real challenge to make family Bible study enjoyable.
It is important that parents show that they appreciate spiritual matters, since children are quick to note inconsistencies. ”
Carlos, who has three sons, comments: “We hold a weekly meeting to consider the family’s needs.
Each member of the family has the opportunity to choose what will be discussed. ”
Kelvin always sought to talk to his children about God wherever they were and whatever they were doing.
That reminds us of Moses ’ words: “These words that I am commanding you today must prove to be on your heart; and you must inculcate them in your son and speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up. ” ​ — Deuteronomy 6: 6, 7.
5 Children Need Discipline
Some parents seem to think that disciplining their children involves severe treatment, including harsh threats or belittling insults.
The Bible, however, does not associate parental discipline with harshness.
On the contrary, parents should discipline in love, just as Jehovah does.
The Bible says: “Fathers, do not be irritating your children, but go on bringing them up in the discipline and mental - regulating of Jehovah. ” ​ — Ephesians 6: 4.
Occasionally, punishment may be necessary.
A child, though, should understand why he is being punished.
Parental discipline should never leave a child feeling rejected.
The Bible does not endorse severe beatings, which may even injure a child.
Kelvin comments, “When I needed to correct my children about serious matters, I always tried to make it clear that my motive for correcting them was my love for them. ”
6 Children Need to Be Protected
Children need to be protected from unwholesome influences and potentially harmful associates.
Sadly, there are “wicked men ” in this world who are bent on exploiting innocent children.
How can you protect your children?
The Bible offers this wise advice: “Shrewd is the one that has seen the calamity and proceeds to conceal himself, but the inexperienced have passed along and must suffer the penalty. ”
To shield your children from calamity, you must be alert to dangers.
Anticipate situations that could lead to problems, and take due precautions.
For example, if you allow your children access to the Internet, be sure that they know how to use it safely.
It may be best to keep the computer in an open area where you can easily monitor its use.
A father needs to prepare and train his children for the dangers they may face in this abusive world.
Do your children know what to do in case someone tries to take advantage of them when you are not present?
* Your children need to know the proper and improper use of their private body parts.
Kelvin comments: “I never left this training to others, not even their teachers.
I felt that it was my personal responsibility to teach my children about sex and the danger of child molesters. ”
All his children safely reached adulthood and are now happily married.
Seek God’s Help
The greatest gift a father can give to his children is that of helping them to develop a solid personal relationship with God.
Donizete says: “Fathers need to show how much they treasure their own relationship with God.
This should become especially clear when they face personal problems or difficulties. On such occasions, the father shows how deeply he trusts in Jehovah.
Family prayer, with repeated expressions of appreciation to God for His goodness, will teach children the importance of having God as their Friend. ”
What, then, is the key to being a good father?
Seek the advice of the one who knows best how to raise children ​ — Jehovah God.
If you train your children according to the guidance of God’s Word, you may well see the results described at Proverbs 22: 6: “Even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it. ”
Although the Scriptural counsel considered in this article focuses primarily on the father’s role, many of the principles are applicable to mothers as well.

She Drew “Conclusions in Her Heart ” MARY shifted her weight uncomfortably atop the little beast of burden.
She had been riding for hours. Just ahead, Joseph walked steadily onward, leading the way along the road toward distant Bethlehem.
Mary once again felt the stirring of life within her.
Mary was well along in her pregnancy; the Bible describes her at this time with the expressive phrase “heavy with child. ”
As the couple passed by one field after another, perhaps some of the farmers looked up from their plowing or sowing and wondered why a woman in such a condition would go on a journey.
What had led Mary so far from her home in Nazareth?
It all began months earlier when this young Jewish woman received an assignment that was unique in all human history.
She was to give birth to the child who would become the Messiah, the Son of God!
As the time to give birth approached, the need to take this journey arose.
In the process, Mary faced a number of challenges to her faith. Let us see what helped her to stay spiritually strong.
The Trip to Bethlehem
Joseph and Mary were not the only ones on the move. Caesar Augustus had recently decreed that a registration be carried out in the land, and people had to travel to their town of origin in order to comply.
How did Joseph respond? The account reads: “Of course, Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because of his being a member of the house and family of David. ” ​ — Luke 2: 1 - 4.
It was no coincidence that Caesar issued his decree at this time.
A prophecy written down some seven centuries earlier foretold that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.
Now it so happened that there was a town named Bethlehem a mere seven miles [11 km] from Nazareth.
However, the prophecy specified that it was “Bethlehem Ephrathah ” that would produce the Messiah.
By present - day roads, some 93 hilly miles [150 km] separate Nazareth from that little village in the south.
Would Mary support Joseph in his decision to comply?
After all, the trip would be hard on her.
It was likely early in the autumn of the year, so light rains were possible as the dry season gradually ended.
What is more, the phrase “went up from Galilee ” is appropriate, for Bethlehem was perched at a lofty altitude of over 2,500 feet [760 m] ​ — quite a climb, an arduous end to a trek of several days.
Perhaps it would take longer than usual, for Mary’s condition might require numerous periods of rest.
Now, of all times, a young woman might yearn to stay close to home, where she had family and friends who were ready to help when her birth pangs began.
Without a doubt, she needed to have courage to take this trip.
Nonetheless, Luke writes that Joseph went “to get registered with Mary. ”
He also notes that Mary “had been given [to Joseph] in marriage as promised. ”
Being Joseph’s wife made a great deal of difference in Mary’s decisions.
She viewed her husband as her spiritual head, embracing her God - given role as his helper by supporting him in his decisions.
* So she met this potential challenge to her faith with simple obedience.
What else may have motivated Mary to obey?
Did she know of the prophecy about Bethlehem as the birthplace of the Messiah?
The Bible does not say.
We cannot rule out the possibility, for the fact was evidently common knowledge among religious leaders and even people in general.
When it came to the Scriptures, Mary was far from an ignorant girl.
At any rate, whether Mary decided to travel in order to obey her husband, a secular decree, or Jehovah’s own prophecy ​ — or because of a combination of factors — ​ she set a sterling example.
Jehovah greatly values a humble, obedient spirit in both men and women.
In our age, when submission often seems to be among the most disregarded of virtues, Mary’s example stands as a beacon for faithful people everywhere.
The Birth of Christ
Mary must have breathed a sigh of relief when she first caught sight of Bethlehem.
As they mounted the hillsides, passing by olive groves ​ — among the last of the crops to be harvested — ​ Mary and Joseph may well have thought about the history of this little village.
It was too insignificant to be numbered among Judah’s cities, just as Micah the prophet had said; yet it was the birthplace of Boaz, Naomi, and later David, all over a thousand years earlier.
Mary and Joseph found the village crowded.
Others had arrived to register before them, so there was no space for them at the lodging room.
* They had no choice but to settle down for the night in a stable.
We can just imagine Joseph’s concern as he saw his wife suffering a sharp discomfort she had never known, which then intensified.
Here, of all places, her birth pangs had begun.
Women everywhere can empathize with Mary.
Some 4,000 years earlier, Jehovah had foretold that it would be the common lot of women to suffer pain during childbirth because of inherited sin.
There is no evidence to suggest that Mary was any exception.
Luke’s account draws a discreet curtain of privacy around the scene, saying simply: “She gave birth to her son, the firstborn. ”
Yes, her “firstborn ” had arrived ​ — the first of Mary’s many children, at least seven in all.
This one, though, would ever stand apart. Not only was he her firstborn but he was Jehovah’s own “firstborn of all creation, ” the only - begotten Son of God! ​ — Colossians 1: 15.
It is at this point that the account adds a famous detail: “She bound him with cloth bands and laid him in a manger. ”
Nativity plays, paintings, and scenes around the world sentimentalize this setting.
Consider, though, the reality.
A manger is a feeding trough, a bin from which farm animals eat.
The family was thus lodging in a stable, hardly a place to be noted for good air or hygiene ​ — then or now.
Really, what parents would choose such a spot for childbirth if there were any other options?
Most parents want the best for their children.
How much more so did Mary and Joseph want to provide the best for the Son of God!
However, they did not let their limitations embitter them; they simply did the best they could with what they had.
Notice, for instance, that Mary herself cared for the infant, wrapping him up snugly in cloth bands, then laying him carefully in the manger to sleep, ensuring that he would be warm and safe.
Mary was not about to let anxiety over her present circumstances distract her from providing the best that she could.
She and Joseph both knew, too, that caring spiritually for this child would be the most important thing they could do for him.
Today, wise parents cultivate similar priorities as they bring their children up in this spiritually impoverished world. A Visit Brings Encouragement
A sudden commotion disturbed the peaceful scene. Shepherds rushed into the stable, eager to see the family and the child in particular.
These men were bubbling over with excitement, their faces radiating joy.
They had hurried in from the hillsides where they were living with their flocks.
* They told the wondering parents about a marvelous experience they had just had.
On the hillside during the night watch, an angel had suddenly appeared to them.
Jehovah’s glory had gleamed all around, and the angel told them that the Christ, or Messiah, had just been born in Bethlehem.
They would find the child lying in a manger, swaddled in cloth bands.
Then, something even more spectacular ​ — a mighty chorus of angels had appeared, singing of Jehovah’s glory!
No wonder these humble men came rushing into Bethlehem!
They must have been thrilled to see a newborn infant lying there just as the angel had described.
They did not keep this good news to themselves. “They made known the saying...
And all that heard marveled over the things told them by the shepherds. ”
The religious leaders of the day evidently looked down on shepherds.
But Jehovah clearly valued these humble, faithful men.
How, though, did this visit affect Mary?
Mary was surely exhausted from the rigors of childbirth, yet she listened intently to every word.
And she did more: “Mary began to preserve all these sayings, drawing conclusions in her heart. ”
This young woman truly was a thinker. She knew that this angelic message was vital.
Her God, Jehovah, wanted her to know and to appreciate her son’s identity and importance.
So she did more than listen. She stored away the words in her heart so that she could ponder over them again and again in the months and years to come.
Here is an outstanding key to the faith that Mary showed throughout her life.
Will you follow Mary’s example?
Jehovah has filled the pages of his Word with vital spiritual truths.
However, those truths can do us little good unless we first pay attention to them.
We do that by reading the Bible regularly ​ — not merely as a work of literature but as the inspired Word of God.
Then, like Mary, we need to store up spiritual sayings in our heart, drawing conclusions.
If we meditate on what we read in the Bible, contemplating ways in which we can apply Jehovah’s counsel more fully, we will give our faith the nourishment it needs to grow.
More Sayings to Preserve
On the baby’s eighth day, Mary and Joseph had him circumcised as the Mosaic Law required, naming him Jesus as directed.
Then, on the 40th day, they took him from Bethlehem to the temple in Jerusalem, a few miles away, and presented the purification offerings that the Law allowed for poorer folk ​ — two turtledoves or two pigeons.
If they felt shame in offering less than the ram and a turtledove that other parents could afford, they put such feelings aside.
At any rate, they received powerful encouragement while they were there. ​ — Luke 2: 21 - 24.
An aged man named Simeon approached them and gave Mary even more sayings to treasure in her heart.
He had been promised that he would see the Messiah before he died, and Jehovah’s holy spirit indicated to him that little Jesus was the foretold Savior.
Simeon also warned Mary of the pain that she would one day have to endure.
He said that she would feel as if a long sword were run through her.
Even those foreboding words may have helped Mary to endure when that hard time came over three decades later.
After Simeon, a prophetess named Anna saw little Jesus and began speaking about him to everyone who cherished the hope of Jerusalem’s deliverance. ​ — Luke 2: 36 - 38.
What a good decision Joseph and Mary had made in bringing their baby to Jehovah’s temple in Jerusalem!
They thus launched their son on a lifelong course of faithful attendance at Jehovah’s temple.
While there, they gave of themselves according to their ability and received words of instruction and encouragement.
Mary surely left the temple that day stronger in faith, her heart full of spiritual sayings to meditate on and share with others.
It is a beautiful thing to see parents today following that example.
Among Jehovah’s Witnesses, parents faithfully bring their children to Christian meetings.
Such parents give what they can, offering words of encouragement to their fellow believers.
And they come away stronger, happier, and full of good things to share with others.
You are cordially invited to meet with them.
If you do, you will find that your faith, like Mary’s, will grow ever stronger.
Note the contrast between this passage and the description of an earlier trip: “Mary rose... and went ” to visit Elizabeth.
At that time, as an engaged but unwed woman, Mary may have acted without consulting Joseph.
After the couple was married, the action of their trip together is ascribed to Joseph, not to Mary.
It was the practice of the day for towns to provide a common room to shelter travelers and passing caravans.
That these shepherds at the time were living out of doors with their flocks confirms what Bible chronology indicates: The birth of Christ did not occur in December when the flocks would have been sheltered closer to home but, rather, sometime in early October.

How My Faith Helped Me to Face Tragedies
As told by Soledad Castillo
When I was 34, my dear husband died.
Six years later, my father died.
Eight months after the death of my father, I learned that my only son had an incurable disease.
MY NAME is Soledad, which means “Loneliness. ”
Strange as it may seem, though, I have never felt entirely alone.
When I faced tragedies, I believed that Jehovah God was there, ‘ grasping me by the hand and helping me so that I did not feel afraid. ’
Allow me to explain how I survived my personal tragedies and how they drew me closer to Jehovah.
A Happy Life With Few Problems
I was born in Barcelona, Spain, on May 3, 1961, the only child of my parents, José and Soledad.
When I was nine years old, my mother learned the truth of God’s Word.
She had searched for answers to her religious questions but had not found satisfaction in her church.
One day, two of Jehovah’s Witnesses visited her at home and answered all her questions from the Scriptures.
She eagerly accepted a Bible study.
Within a short time, my mother became a baptized Witness of Jehovah, and a few years later, my father followed her example.
Eliana, who conducted the study with my mother, soon noticed my keen interest in God’s Word.
Although I was only a young girl, Eliana suggested that I have my own study.
Thanks to her help and my mother’s encouragement, I got baptized at the age of 13.
In the congregation, I had many friends, and I had a close relationship with my parents.
In 1982, I married Felipe, a Witness who had spiritual goals like mine.
Bringing Up Our Child to Love Jehovah
Five years later, I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy whom we named Saúl. Felipe and I were delighted to have a child.
We hoped that Saúl would grow up as a healthy, balanced child with a love for God.
Felipe and I spent a lot of time with Saúl, talking to him about Jehovah, having meals together, taking him to the park, and playing games with him.
Saúl loved going with Felipe to share Bible truths with others, and Felipe got him involved in the ministry at an early age, teaching him to ring the doorbells and offer tracts to people.
Saúl responded well to our love and training.
By the age of six, he regularly preached with us.
He loved listening to Bible stories, and he looked forward to our family Bible study.
Soon after he began to attend school, he started to make small decisions based on his knowledge of the Bible.
However, when Saúl reached the age of seven, our family life changed dramatically.
Felipe contracted a viral infection in his lungs.
For 11 months, he struggled with the disease, unable to work and often confined to bed.
At the age of 36, my husband died.
I still weep when I remember that difficult year.
I watched my husband gradually lose the battle against the virus, and there was nothing I could do.
Throughout it all, I tried to keep giving Felipe encouragement, although deep inside, my own hopes and plans were being dashed to pieces.
I read Scriptural articles to him, and these strengthened us when we could not attend Christian meetings.
When he died, a feeling of great emptiness came over me.
Yet, Jehovah sustained me.
I constantly asked him to give me his spirit.
I thanked him for the happy years Felipe and I had spent together and for the hope of seeing Felipe again in the resurrection.
I asked God to help me be happy with the memory of what my husband and I had shared together and to give me the wisdom to bring up our child as a true Christian.
Despite the great pain, I felt comforted.
My parents as well as those in the congregation gave me considerable support.
Still, I had to take the lead in studying the Bible with Saúl and teaching him how to serve Jehovah.
A former employer offered me a good office job, but I preferred to do cleaning work so that I could spend more time with Saúl and be with him when his school day ended.
One scripture emphasized for me the importance of Saúl’s spiritual training: “Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it. ”
This text gave me the hope that if I did my best to communicate spiritual values to Saúl, Jehovah would bless my efforts.
True, I had to make some economic sacrifices, but I needed to spend time with my son, and this mattered much more to me than any material advantage.
When Saúl was 14 years of age, my father died.
Saúl felt especially devastated, since his grandfather’s death brought back all the pain he had felt upon losing his own father.
My father had also set a fine example of love for Jehovah. After this loss, Saúl decided that he had become the only “man ” in the family, and he would now have to take care of his mother and his grandmother.
Fighting Leukemia
Eight months after the death of my father, our family doctor told me to take Saúl to the local hospital, since he was suffering from extreme fatigue.
After a series of tests, the doctors informed me that Saúl had leukemia.
During the following two and a half years, Saúl was in and out of the hospital as he struggled to cope with the cancer and the chemotherapy the doctors used in their effort to fight it.
The first six - month program of treatment led to a remission that lasted about 18 months.
But the cancer returned, and Saúl had another shorter treatment of chemotherapy that severely weakened him.
The cancer went into remission for only a brief period, and Saúl could not cope with a third course of chemotherapy.
Saúl had dedicated his life to God and had expressed his desire to be baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, but he died just after reaching the age of 17.
Doctors often recommend blood transfusions to counteract the aggressive nature of chemotherapy.
Of course, transfusions cannot cure the disease.
When the doctors first diagnosed the leukemia, both Saúl and I had to make clear that we would not accept this treatment, since we wanted to obey Jehovah’s law to “abstain... from blood. ”
On several occasions, Saúl had to convince the doctors in my absence that he was making his own decision in this matter.
(See box on page 31.) The doctors finally came to the conclusion that Saúl was a mature minor who understood perfectly well the nature of his disease.
They agreed to respect our stand and offered us bloodless treatment, although we were under constant pressure to change our decision.
I felt very proud of Saúl when I listened to him explaining his stand to the doctors.
Clearly, he had developed a close relationship with Jehovah.
During the summer when we first learned of Saúl’s disease, the book entitled Draw Close to Jehovah was released at our district convention in Barcelona.
That invaluable book proved to be like an anchor to keep us firm as we faced our uncertain and daunting future.
During the hours we spent in the hospital, we read portions of it together.
During the many difficult times that we endured afterward, we often recalled its contents.
That was when the text of Isaiah 41: 13, mentioned in the prologue of that book, came to have special meaning for us.
It says: “I, Jehovah your God, am grasping your right hand, the One saying to you, ‘ Do not be afraid.
I myself will help you. ’ ”
Saúl’s Faith Touches the Hearts of Others
Saúl’s maturity and optimism deeply impressed doctors and nurses at Vall d’Hebrón Hospital.
He endeared himself to the entire team that took care of him.
The chief hematologist handling cancer cases has since treated other Witness children suffering from leukemia, and he has accorded them great respect and dignity.
He recalls Saúl’s firm decision to uphold his beliefs, his courage in the face of death, and his happy outlook on life.
The team of nurses told Saúl that he was the best patient they had ever had in that ward.
They said that he never complained and never lost his sense of humor ​ — even when he was about to die.
A psychologist told me that many children who have to face such a terminal illness at this age tend to rebel against doctors and parents because of discomfort and frustration.
She noticed that this did not occur in the case of Saúl.
To her, it was amazing to see Saúl so calm and positive.
This gave Saúl and me an opportunity to witness to her about our faith.
I also recall how Saúl indirectly helped a Witness in our congregation.
He had suffered from depression for some six years, and medication had not improved his condition.
On several occasions, he spent the night caring for Saúl in the hospital.
He told me that Saúl’s attitude in the face of leukemia deeply impressed him.
He noticed that despite his exhaustion, Saúl tried to encourage everyone who visited him.
“Saúl’s example gave me the courage to fight my depression, ” this Witness says.
Three years have now passed since Saúl’s death. The pain, of course, is still there.
I am not strong, but God has given me “the power beyond what is normal. ”
I have learned that even the most difficult and painful experiences can have a positive side.
Learning to cope with the deaths of my husband, my father, and my son has helped me to become more unselfish and more understanding toward others who suffer.
Above all, it has drawn me closer to Jehovah.
I can face the future without fear because my heavenly Father still helps me.
He still grasps me by the hand.
Saúl had lymphoblastic leukemia, a serious type of blood cancer that destroys the white blood cells.
[Box / ​ Picture on page 31]
HAVE YOU WONDERED?
You may have heard that Jehovah’s Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions.
Have you ever wondered why?
This Scriptural stand is often misunderstood.
Sometimes people assume that Jehovah’s Witnesses refuse all medical treatment or that they simply do not value life.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Jehovah’s Witnesses seek the best medical care available to them and their family members.
However, they seek nonblood medical management.
Their stand is based on a fundamental law that God gave to mankind.
Just after the Flood of Noah’s day, God gave Noah and his family permission to eat the flesh of animals.
God imposed this one restriction: They were not to consume blood.
All humans of all races descended from Noah, so this law is binding on all of mankind.
It was never rescinded.
Over eight centuries later, God reaffirmed that law to the nation of Israel, explaining that blood is sacred, representing the soul, or life itself.
Over 1,500 years later, the Christian apostles commanded all Christians to “keep abstaining... from blood. ” ​ — Acts 15: 29.
To Jehovah’s Witnesses, it is clearly impossible to abstain from blood while taking it into the body in a transfusion.
They therefore insist on alternative treatments.
That Scriptural stand often results in an even higher standard of medical care.
No doubt that is why many people who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses also request bloodless medical treatment.

Jehovah’s “Beaming Eyes ” Examine All
“[Jehovah’s] beaming eyes examine the sons of men. ” ​ — PS.
11: 4.
HOW do you feel about people who take a genuine interest in you?
Are you not drawn to such people? Well, Jehovah and his Son are just like that. In fact, their interest in you exceeds that of any human, and their motive is entirely unselfish; they want to help you to “get a firm hold on the real life. ” ​ — 1 Tim.
6: 19; Rev.
3: 19.
To what extent is Jehovah interested in his servants?
The psalmist David expressed the depth of Jehovah’s interest in us when he said: “[Jehovah’s] own eyes behold, his own beaming eyes examine the sons of men. ”
Yes, God does not simply look at us; he examines us.
David also wrote: “You have examined my heart, you have made inspection by night...
You will discover that I have not schemed. ”
Clearly, David was aware of the depth of Jehovah’s interest in him.
He knew that he would hurt Jehovah and merit His displeasure if he nurtured sinful thoughts or developed a scheming heart.
Is Jehovah as real to you as he was to David?
Jehovah Sees the Heart
How does Jehovah demonstrate a balanced attitude toward our imperfections?
Jehovah’s primary interest is in the inner person ​ — who we really are at heart.
Lovingly, he does not dwell on minor failings.
For example, when Sarah, the wife of Abraham, spoke less than truthfully to a materialized angel, the angel evidently saw that she was afraid and embarrassed, so he simply gave her a mild reproof.
When the patriarch Job declared “his own soul righteous rather than God, ” Jehovah did not withhold a blessing from him, aware that Job had suffered intensely at Satan’s hand.
Likewise, Jehovah did not take offense at the frank words of the widow of Zarephath to the prophet Elijah.
God understood that she was grief - stricken at the loss of her only child. ​ — 1 Ki.
17: 8 - 24.
4, 5.
How did Jehovah show graciousness in the way he dealt with Abimelech?
Because Jehovah examines the heart, he has shown consideration even toward unbelievers.
Consider his dealings with Abimelech, king of the Philistine city of Gerar.
Abimelech, not realizing that Abraham and Sarah were married, took Sarah to become his own wife.
However, before Abimelech could go any further, Jehovah said to him in a dream: “I too have known that in the honesty of your heart you have done this, and I was also holding you back from sinning against me. That is why I did not allow you to touch her.
But now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will make supplication for you. So keep living. ” ​ — Gen.
20: 1 - 7.
To be sure, Jehovah could have dealt harshly with Abimelech, a worshipper of false deities.
But God saw that the man acted honestly on this occasion.
Graciously acknowledging this, Jehovah told the king how to gain forgiveness and “keep living. ”
Is that not the kind of God that you want to worship?
In what ways did Jesus imitate his Father?
Jesus perfectly imitated his Father, focusing on the good in his disciples and readily forgiving their errors.
Jesus ’ attitude harmonized with his words found at John 3: 17: “God sent forth his Son into the world, not for him to judge the world, but for the world to be saved through him. ”
Yes, the love that Jehovah and Jesus have for us is deep and constant. It is seen in their desire that we gain life.
Such love explains why Jehovah examines us, how he views us, and how he acts on what he sees. ​ — Read 1 John 4: 8, 19.
Examined Through the Eyes of Love
With what motive does Jehovah examine us?
How wrong it is, then, to think of Jehovah as a celestial policeman who peers down from above in order to catch us in the act of sinning!
Satan is the one with a cynical, accusing eye.
He even attributes bad motives where there are none!
Concerning God, the psalmist wrote: “If errors were what you watch, O Jah, O Jehovah, who could stand? ”
The implied answer is, No one!
Rather, Jehovah watches us with the merciful, kind eyes of a caring parent who wants to protect his beloved children from harm.
He often alerts us to our imperfections and weaknesses so that we can avoid harming ourselves. ​ — Ps.
103: 10 - 14; Matt.
26: 41.
How does Jehovah instruct and discipline his servants?
God’s love is expressed through the instruction and discipline provided both in the Scriptures and in the spiritual food dispensed by “the faithful and discreet slave. ”
Jehovah also extends help by way of the Christian congregation and its “gifts in men. ”
What is more, Jehovah watches to see how we respond to his fatherly training, and he seeks to help us further.
Says Psalm 32: 8: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go.
I will give advice with my eye upon you. ”
How important it is, then, that we always listen to Jehovah!
We need to keep ourselves humble before him, recognizing that he is our loving Teacher and Father. ​ — Read Matthew 18: 4.
What traits should we avoid, and why?
Conversely, may we never become hardened by pride, by a lack of faith, or by “the deceptive power of sin. ”
Often, these traits begin when a person nurtures unwholesome thoughts or desires.
He may even reach the point of rejecting appropriate Scriptural counsel.
Worse still, he may become so set in his bad attitude or ways that he makes himself an enemy of God ​ — a truly fearful situation!
Consider the example of Cain, the firstborn of Adam and Eve.
Jehovah Sees All and Acts Accordingly
Why did Jehovah disapprove of Cain’s offering, and how did Cain respond?
When Cain and Abel each brought an offering to Jehovah, He was interested not only in their gift but also in their motive.
As a result, God expressed his approval of Abel’s offering, rendered in faith, but his disapproval of Cain’s, which in some way reflected a lack of faith.
Rather than learn from the event and change his attitude, Cain became consumed with anger toward his brother. ​ — Gen.
4: 6.
How did Cain manifest a treacherous heart, and what is the lesson for us?
Jehovah observed this dangerous development and considerately spoke to Cain, pointing out that if he did good, he would have cause for exaltation.
Sadly, Cain ignored his Creator’s counsel and murdered his brother.
Cain’s bad heart was further reflected in the insolent manner in which he replied to God’s question: “Where is Abel your brother? ”
Cain retorted: “I do not know.
Am I my brother’s guardian? ”
How treacherous the heart can be ​ — even to the point of disregarding the direct counsel of God!
Let us therefore learn from such accounts and be quick to reject wrong thoughts and desires.
(Read James 1: 14, 15.)
If we receive Scriptural counsel, may we appreciate it and view it as an evidence of Jehovah’s love.
There Is No Secret Sin
How does Jehovah respond to wrongdoing?
Some may feel that if no one sees them do wrong, they will get away with it.
In a sense, there is no such thing as a secret sin.
“All things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting. ”
Jehovah is a Judge who examines our deepest motives, and he responds to wrongdoing in a way that reflects perfect justice.
He is “a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving - kindness and truth. ”
Yet, to the unrepentant, he will “by no means... give exemption from punishment ” when individuals“ practice sin willfully ” or manifest a devious, scheming attitude.
This fact was reflected in Jehovah’s dealings with Achan and with Ananias and Sapphira.
How did wrong thinking evidently contribute to Achan’s bad conduct?
In direct violation of God’s command, Achan took spoil from the city of Jericho and hid it in his tent, likely with the complicity of his family.
When his sin was exposed, Achan showed that he realized the seriousness of what he had done, for he said: “I have sinned against Jehovah. ”
Like Cain, Achan had developed a bad heart.
In Achan’s case, greed was a major factor, and it contributed to his becoming deceitful.
Since the spoil from Jericho belonged to Jehovah, Achan in effect stole from God, and this cost him and his family dearly. ​ — Josh.
7: 25.
14, 15.
Why did Ananias and Sapphira merit God’s disapproval, and what is the lesson for us?
Ananias and his wife, Sapphira, were members of the early Christian congregation in Jerusalem.
Following Pentecost of 33 C.E., a common fund was set up to care for the physical needs of the new believers from distant lands who still remained in Jerusalem.
The fund was maintained by voluntary contributions. Ananias sold a field and donated part of the money to the fund. However, with his wife’s full knowledge, he pretended that he had donated the entire proceeds.
No doubt, this couple wanted to gain special honor within the congregation.
But their act was deceitful.
In a miraculous way, Jehovah revealed the fraud to the apostle Peter, who confronted Ananias with his error. At that, Ananias fell down and expired.
Ananias and Sapphira did not fall prey to a momentary weakness.
They schemed and lied in an attempt to deceive the apostles. Worse still, they ‘ played false to the holy spirit and to God. ’
Jehovah’s response demonstrates in no uncertain terms that he is prepared to protect the congregation from hypocrites. Truly, “it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God ”! ​ — Heb.
Maintain Integrity at All Times
(a) How is Satan trying to corrupt God’s people?
(b) What methods does the Devil employ to corrupt people in your area?
Satan is doing all he can to corrupt us and make us lose Jehovah’s approval.
The Devil’s evil intentions are clearly reflected in the world, which is obsessed with immoral sex and violence.
Pornography can now be easily accessed through computers or other electronic devices. May we never succumb to Satan’s attacks.
Rather, may our sentiments be like those of the psalmist David, who wrote: “I will act with discretion in a faultless way....
I shall walk about in the integrity of my heart inside my house. ” ​ — Ps.
101: 2.
(a) Why does Jehovah eventually bring hidden sins into the open?
(b) What should be our determination?
Today, Jehovah does not miraculously reveal gross sin and deceitful conduct as he sometimes did in the past.
Still, he sees all and in his own time and way brings hidden things into the open.
Paul said: “The sins of some men are publicly manifest, leading directly to judgment, but as for other men their sins also become manifest later. ”
Jehovah’s primary motive in bringing bad deeds into the light is love.
He loves the congregation and wants to protect its purity.
Moreover, he shows mercy to those who were overtaken by sin but who are now truly repentant.
So let us strive to maintain a complete heart toward God and reject all corrupting influences.
Maintain a Complete Heart
How did King David want his son to feel toward God?
To his son Solomon, King David said: “Know the God of your father and serve him with a complete heart and with a delightful soul; for all hearts Jehovah is searching, and every inclination of the thoughts he is discerning. ”
David wanted his son to do more than merely believe in God.
He wanted Solomon to appreciate the depth of Jehovah’s interest in His servants.
Do you appreciate Jehovah in that way?
19, 20.
According to Psalm 19: 7 - 11, what helped David to draw close to God, and how can we imitate David?
Jehovah knows that rightly inclined people will be drawn to him and that knowledge of his beautiful qualities will warm their heart.
Hence, Jehovah wants us to get to know him and to become acquainted with his wonderful personality.
How do we do so?
By studying his Word and by experiencing his blessing in our lives. ​ — Prov.
10: 22; John 14: 9.
Do you read God’s Word daily in an appreciative, prayerful frame of mind?
Do you see the value of living by Bible principles?
(Read Psalm 19: 7 - 11.)
If so, your faith in Jehovah and your love for him will continue to grow.
And he, in turn, will draw ever closer to you, walking hand in hand with you, as it were.
Yes, Jehovah will prove his love for you by blessing you and protecting you spiritually as you walk along the cramped road to life. ​ — Ps.
91: 1, 2; Matt.
7: 13, 14.

What will help us to keep on serving Jehovah with a complete heart?
Jehovah Watches Us for Our Good
“[Jehovah’s] eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him. ” ​ — 2 CHRON.
16: 9.
Why does Jehovah examine us?
JEHOVAH is the perfect Father. He knows us so well that he is aware even of the “inclination of [our] thoughts. ”
However, he does not examine us merely in order to find fault.
Rather, he lovingly wants to protect us from anything that might damage our relationship with him or harm our prospects for gaining everlasting life. ​ — Ps.
25: 8 - 10, 12, 13.
Jehovah shows his strength in behalf of whom?
Jehovah is matchless in power and sees all. For that reason, he can come to the aid of his loyal ones whenever they call on him, and he can support them during their trials.
“[Jehovah’s] eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him, ” says 2 Chronicles 16: 9.
Note that Jehovah uses his strength in behalf of those who serve him with a complete heart, a heart that is pure and sincere in motive. He shows no such concern for those who are deceitful or hypocritical. ​ — Josh.
7: 1, 20, 21, 25; Prov.
1: 23 - 33.
Walk With God
3, 4.
What does it mean to ‘ walk with God, ’ and what Bible examples shed light on this matter?
To many, it is inconceivable that the Creator of our vast universe allows humans to walk with him in a spiritual sense.
Yet, that is exactly what Jehovah wants us to do. In Bible times, Enoch and Noah ‘ walked with God. ’
Moses “continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible. ”
King David found himself humbly walking alongside his heavenly Father.
He said: “Because [Jehovah] is at my right hand, I shall not be made to totter. ” ​ — Ps.
16: 8.
Of course, we cannot literally take Jehovah by the hand and walk with him.
But we can do so in a figurative sense. How?
The psalmist Asaph writes: “I am constantly with you; you have taken hold of my right hand.
With your counsel you will lead me. ”
24: 45; 2 Tim.
3: 16.
How does Jehovah keep a fatherly eye upon his loyal ones, and how should we feel toward him?
Because Jehovah cherishes those who walk with him, he keeps his fatherly eye upon them, caring for them, protecting them, and teaching them.
“I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go, ” God says.
“I will give advice with my eye upon you. ”
Ask yourself: ‘ Do I see myself walking hand in hand with Jehovah, as it were, listening to his wisdom and knowing that his loving eye is upon me?
Does my awareness of his presence influence my thoughts, words, and deeds?
And when I err, do I see Jehovah, not as a God who is aloof and stern, but as a warm, merciful Father who wants to help repentant ones back into his warm embrace? ’ ​ — Ps.
51: 17.
What advantage does Jehovah have over a human parent?
At times, Jehovah may come to our aid even before we embark on a wrong course.
For instance, he may observe that our potentially treacherous heart begins to desire things that are improper.
In such a situation, he can act even sooner than human parents can because his “beaming eyes ” have the ability to look deep inside us, to examine our inmost thoughts.
Consider God’s response to a situation that developed in the life of Baruch, the prophet Jeremiah’s personal secretary and close friend.
A True Father to Baruch
7, 8. (a) Who was Baruch, and what unwholesome desires may have started to develop in his heart?
(b) How did Jehovah demonstrate his fatherly concern for Baruch?
Baruch was a professional scribe who faithfully served alongside Jeremiah in what became a difficult assignment ​ — proclaiming Jehovah’s judgments to Judah.
At some point, Baruch, who may have belonged to a prominent family, began to seek “great things ” for himself.
Perhaps he began to nurture personal ambitions or a desire for material prosperity.
Whatever the case, Jehovah saw that this dangerous thinking was developing in Baruch’s heart.
Speaking through Jeremiah, Jehovah promptly addressed the matter, saying to Baruch: “You have said: ‘ Woe, now, to me, for Jehovah has added grief to my pain!
I have grown weary because of my sighing, and no resting - place have I found. ’ ”
Then God said: “You keep seeking great things for yourself.
Do not keep on seeking. ” ​ — Jer.
45: 1 - 5.
Although he was firm with Baruch, Jehovah reacted, not with anger, but with genuine fatherly concern.
Evidently, God saw that the man’s desires did not reflect a wicked or devious heart.
Jehovah also knew that Jerusalem and Judah were in their last days, and he did not want Baruch to stumble at that critical time.
Hence, to bring his servant back to reality, God reminded him that He was “bringing in a calamity upon all flesh, ” adding that if Baruch acted wisely, he would live.
In effect, God said: ‘ Be realistic, Baruch.
Keep in mind what will soon happen to sinful Judah and Jerusalem. Remain faithful and live!
I will protect you. ’ Jehovah evidently reached Baruch’s heart, for he responded positively and survived the destruction of Jerusalem, which occurred 17 years later.
How would you answer the questions raised in the paragraph?
As you reflect on the account about Baruch, consider the following questions and scriptures: What does God’s way of dealing with Baruch reveal about Jehovah and his feelings toward his servants?
(Read Hebrews 12: 9.)
In view of the critical times in which we live, what can we learn from God’s counsel to Baruch and from Baruch’s response?
(Read Luke 21: 34 - 36.)
In imitation of Jeremiah, how can Christian elders reflect Jehovah’s concern for His servants? ​ — Read Galatians 6: 1.
The Father’s Love Reflected in the Son
How is Jesus equipped to handle his position as Head of the Christian congregation?
During the pre - Christian era, Jehovah’s love for his people was revealed through his prophets and other faithful servants.
Nowadays, it is seen, above all, in the Head of the Christian congregation, Jesus Christ.
Thus, in the book of Revelation, Jesus is depicted as a lamb with “seven eyes, which eyes mean the seven spirits of God that have been sent forth into the whole earth. ”
Yes, empowered with the fullness of God’s holy spirit, Jesus has perfect discernment.
He too sees what we are on the inside, and nothing escapes his notice.
What role does Christ play, and how does his attitude toward us reflect that of his Father?
Like Jehovah, though, Jesus is no celestial policeman.
He examines us through the eyes of love.
One of Jesus ’ titles, “Eternal Father, ” reminds us of the role he will play in the granting of everlasting life to all who exercise faith in him.
4: 1, 2.
(a) What do the letters to the seven congregations in Asia Minor reveal about Jesus?
(b) How do elders reflect Christ’s attitude toward God’s flock?
Christ’s deep interest in the flock is reflected in the letters to the elders of the seven congregations in Asia Minor.
Therein, Jesus indicated both his awareness of what was happening in each congregation and the depth of his concern for his followers.
The same applies today ​ — only more so — ​ since the Revelation vision is fulfilled during “the Lord’s Day. ”
* Christ’s love is often expressed through the elders, who serve as spiritual shepherds of the congregation.
He can move these “gifts in men ” to give comfort, encouragement, or counsel when needed.
Do you view their efforts as an expression of Christ’s interest in you personally?
Help at the Right Time
13 - 15.
How may God choose to answer our prayers?
Give examples.
Have you ever prayed intensely for help and received an answer in the form of an encouraging visit from a spiritually mature Christian?
Or perhaps the help came in the form of a talk at a Christian meeting or information in one of our publications.
Jehovah often answers prayers in these ways.
For example, after giving a talk, an elder was approached by a sister who in the weeks prior to the talk had been the victim of a gross injustice.
Instead of complaining about her problem, she expressed deep appreciation for certain scriptural points made in the talk.
They applied to her situation and gave her much comfort.
Because of a violent incident, a number of privileges were taken away from all the prisoners in the facility.
That sparked a protest. The prisoners decided that after breakfast the next morning, as an act of defiance, they would refuse to return their plates. The three unbaptized publishers were now in a dilemma.
If they joined in the revolt, they would be violating Jehovah’s counsel found at Romans 13: 1.
If they did not join in, they could expect reprisals from angry inmates.
Unable to communicate with one another, the three men prayed for wisdom. The following morning, all three found that they had decided on exactly the same solution ​ — they simply would decline breakfast.
When the guards later came to collect the plates, the three men had none to return. How glad they were that the “Hearer of prayer ” was near! ​ — Ps.
65: 2.
Facing the Future With Confidence
How does the preaching work show Jehovah’s concern for sheeplike ones?
The worldwide preaching work is yet another evidence of Jehovah’s concern for honesthearted individuals, wherever they may live.
Jehovah, often by using angelic direction, can guide his servants to sheeplike ones ​ — even if these live in areas not yet reached by the good news.
For example, by means of an angel, God directed Philip, an evangelizer of the first century, to intercept an Ethiopian official and open up the Scriptures to him.
The result?
The man accepted the good news and became a baptized follower of Jesus.
Why should we not become overly anxious about the future?
As the present system of things moves toward its end, the foretold “pangs of distress ” will continue.
For example, food prices may rise considerably because of increasing demand, extreme weather, or economic instability. Employment may become harder to find, and employees may come under increased pressure to work longer hours.
Whatever happens, all who keep spiritual interests in first place and maintain a ‘ simple eye ’ need not be overly anxious. They know that God loves them and will care for them.
Consider, for example, how Jehovah provided for Jeremiah at the time of Jerusalem’s turbulent end in 607 B.C.E.
How did Jehovah prove his love for Jeremiah during the siege of Jerusalem?
During the latter part of the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, Jeremiah was imprisoned in the Courtyard of the Guard.
How would he obtain food?
Had he been free, he could have searched for it. Instead, he was totally dependent on those around him, most of whom hated him!
Still, Jeremiah trusted not in men but in God, who promised to care for him.
Did Jehovah live up to his word?
Absolutely! He saw to it that Jeremiah daily received “a round loaf of bread... until all the bread was exhausted from the city. ”
Jeremiah, as well as Baruch, Ebed - melech, and others, survived that time of famine, disease, and death. ​ — Jer.
38: 2; 39: 15 - 18.
As we face the future, what should be our resolve?
Yes, “the eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous ones, and his ears are toward their supplication. ”
Do you rejoice in your heavenly Father’s watchfulness?
Do you feel safe and secure in knowing that his eyes are upon you for your good?
Be determined, then, to continue walking with God ​ — no matter what the future may hold.
We can be sure that Jehovah will always keep a close, fatherly eye upon all his loyal ones. ​ — Ps. 32: 8; read Isaiah 41: 13.
Although the letters apply primarily to Christ’s anointed followers, in principle they apply to all of God’s servants.
Another example of heavenly direction can be found at Acts 16: 6 - 10.
There, we read that Paul and his companions “were forbidden by the holy spirit ” to preach in Asia and Bithynia. Instead, they were summoned to work in Macedonia, where many meek individuals responded to their evangelizing.

Jehovah’s Answer to a Heartfelt Prayer
“That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth. ” ​ — PS.
83: 18.
1, 2.
What experience have many had, and what questions could be asked?
SOME years ago, a woman was deeply disturbed by a tragedy that occurred in her neighborhood.
Born into a Roman Catholic family, she went to the local priest for help, but he was unwilling even to speak with her.
So she prayed to God: “I don’t know who you are..., but I know you’re there. Please let me know you! ”
A short while later, Jehovah’s Witnesses visited her and gave her the comfort and knowledge she had sought.
Among many other things, they taught her that God has a personal name, Jehovah.
Learning that was a very emotional experience for her.
“Imagine, ” she said,“ this was the God I had longed to know since I was a child! ”
Often, they first saw Jehovah’s name when they read Psalm 83: 18 in the Bible.
In the New World Translation, that verse reads: “That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth. ”
Have you ever wondered, though, why Psalm 83 was written?
What events would force everyone to acknowledge that Jehovah is the only true God?
What message does this psalm have for us today?
We will consider those questions in this article.
A Conspiracy Against Jehovah’s People
3, 4.
By whom was Psalm 83 composed, and what threat does he describe?
According to the superscription, Psalm 83 is “a melody of Asaph. ”
The composer of the psalm was likely a descendant of the Levite Asaph, a prominent musician during the reign of King David.
In the psalm, the psalmist begs Jehovah to take action so as to uphold His sovereignty and make His name known.
The psalm must have been composed some time after Solomon’s death.
Because during the reigns of David and Solomon, Tyre’s king was friendly toward Israel.
By the time Psalm 83 was composed, the inhabitants of Tyre had turned against Israel and had sided with its enemies. The psalmist names ten nations that were conspiring to destroy God’s people.
Those enemies were situated all around Israel and are listed as follows: “The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites, Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia together with the inhabitants of Tyre.
Also, Assyria itself has become joined with them. ”
To what historical event does the psalm refer?
Some suggest that the psalm refers to the attack on Israel by the coalition of Ammon, Moab, and the inhabitants of Mount Seir in the days of Jehoshaphat.
Others believe that it speaks of the general hostility Israel experienced from its neighbors throughout its history.
What benefit do Christians today gain from Psalm 83?
Whatever the case, it is evident that Jehovah God inspired the writing of this prayerful song at a time when his nation was in danger.
The psalm also provides encouragement for God’s servants today, who throughout their history have faced one attack after another by enemies determined to destroy them.
And it will surely strengthen us in the near future when Gog of Magog marshals his forces in one final attempt to destroy all who worship God in spirit and truth. ​ — Read Ezekiel 38: 2, 8, 9, 16.
A Matter of Primary Concern
6, 7. (a) What does the psalmist pray for in the opening words of Psalm 83?
(b) What was the psalmist’s foremost concern?
Listen as the psalmist pours out his feelings in prayer: “O God, let there be no silence on your part; do not keep speechless, and do not stay quiet, O Divine One.
your very enemies are in an uproar; and the very ones intensely hating you have raised their head.
Against your people they cunningly carry on their confidential talk...
For with the heart they have unitedly exchanged counsel; against you they proceeded to conclude even a covenant. ” ​ — Ps.
83: 1 - 3, 5.
What was the psalmist’s foremost concern?
Of course, he must have been very worried about his own personal safety and that of his family.
Yet, the subject of his prayer was the reproach being brought on Jehovah’s name and the threats against the nation that bore that name.
May we all keep a similar, balanced viewpoint as we endure the difficult final days of this old world. ​ — Read Matthew 6: 9, 10.
What was the objective of the nations in conspiring against Israel?
What hatred those nations had for God’s chosen people! But they had another motive for their conspiracy.
They coveted Israel’s land and boasted: “Let us take possession of the abiding places of God for ourselves. ”
Has something similar been true in our day?
“Your Holy Abiding Place ”
9, 10. (a) In ancient times, what was God’s holy abiding place?
(b) What blessings are enjoyed today by the anointed remnant and the “other sheep ”?
In ancient times, the Promised Land was referred to as God’s holy abiding place.
Recall the victory song that the Israelites sang after being delivered from Egypt: “You in your loving - kindness have led the people whom you have recovered; you in your strength will certainly conduct them to your holy abiding place. ”
Later, that “abiding place ” contained a temple with its priesthood and a capital city, Jerusalem, with a line of kings who descended from David and sat on Jehovah’s throne. Not without reason, Jesus called Jerusalem“ the city of the great King. ” ​ — Matt.
5: 35.
What about in our day?
In 33 C.E., a new nation, “the Israel of God, ” was born.
That nation, made up of anointed brothers of Jesus Christ, fulfilled the task that fleshly Israel ultimately failed in, that of being witnesses to God’s name.
To them, Jehovah made the same promise that he made to ancient Israel: “I shall be their God, and they will be my people. ”
In 1919, Jehovah brought the remaining ones of “the Israel of God ” into a favored position, and at that time, they took possession of a“ land, ” a spiritual realm of activity wherein they have enjoyed a spiritual paradise.
Since the 1930 ’ s, millions of “other sheep ” have flocked to their side.
The happiness and spiritual prosperity of these modern - day Christians furnishes powerful evidence of the rightness of Jehovah’s sovereignty. (Read Psalm 91: 1, 2.)
How that infuriates Satan!
What continues to be the main goal of God’s enemies?
Throughout the time of the end, Satan has incited his earthly agents to oppose the anointed remnant and their other sheep companions.
That happened in Western Europe under the Nazis and in Eastern Europe under the Communist government of the Soviet Union.
It also happened in many other lands, and it will happen again, especially during the final attack of Gog of Magog.
In that attack, opposers may greedily seize the property and possessions of Jehovah’s people, as enemies have done in the past.
Satan’s main goal, however, has always been to break us up as a people so that our God - given name will be remembered no more.
How does Jehovah react to such defiance of his sovereignty?
Look back at the words of the psalmist.
A Pattern for Jehovah’s Victory
12 - 14.
What two historic victories near the city of Megiddo does the psalmist call to mind?
Note the psalmist’s strong faith in Jehovah’s ability to frustrate the plans of enemy nations.
He weaves together two decisive victories of Israel over its enemies near the ancient city of Megiddo, which dominated a valley plain of the same name.
During the summer, the dry bed of the Kishon River can be seen winding through the valley plain.
After a winter downpour, the river floods the plain.
Perhaps for that reason, the river is also called “the waters of Megiddo. ” ​ — Judg.
4: 13; 5: 19.
About ten miles [15 km] across the valley from Megiddo lies the hill of Moreh where in the days of Judge Gideon, the combined troops of Midianites, Amalekites, and Easterners gathered to wage war.
Gideon’s small force finally numbered only 300 men, but with Jehovah’s help, they routed the large enemy force.
Following God’s direction, they surrounded the enemy camp at night holding jars that concealed flaming torches.
When Gideon gave the signal, his men smashed the jars and the hidden torches were suddenly revealed.
At the same time, they blew their horns and shouted: “Jehovah’s sword and Gideon’s! ”
The enemy were thrown into confusion, and they turned to killing one another; survivors fled across the Jordan River.
Meanwhile, more Israelites joined in pursuit of the enemy.
Altogether, 120,000 enemy soldiers were slaughtered. ​ — Judg.
7: 19 - 25; 8: 10.
Some four miles [6 km] beyond the hill of Moreh, across the valley from Megiddo, lies Mount Tabor.
There, Judge Barak had earlier gathered 10,000 Israelite troops to confront the army of Jabin, the Canaanite king of Hazor, under the command of his military chief Sisera.
This Canaanite army had 900 war chariots equipped with deadly long blades of iron that turned with the wheels.
As Israel’s poorly equipped troops assembled on Mount Tabor, Sisera’s army was lured into the valley.
Then, “Jehovah began to throw Sisera and all his war chariots and all the camp into confusion. ”
Likely, a sudden downpour of rain caused the chariots to get bogged down because of the overflowing Kishon River.
The entire army was slaughtered by the Israelites. ​ — Judg.
4: 13 - 16; 5: 19 - 21.
(a) What does the psalmist pray that Jehovah will do?
(b) Of what does the name of God’s final battle remind us?
The psalmist begs Jehovah to do something similar to the nations who threaten Israel’s existence in his day.
He prays: “Do to them as to Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin at the torrent valley of Kishon. They were annihilated at En - dor; they became manure for the ground. ”
Significantly, God’s final war against Satan’s world is called Har – Magedon (meaning “Mountain of Megiddo ”), or Armageddon.
That name reminds us of the dramatic battles that took place near Megiddo.
Jehovah’s victory in those ancient wars assures us of his certain triumph in the battle of Armageddon. ​ — Rev. 16: 13 - 16.
Pray for Jehovah’s Vindication
How have the faces of opposers been ‘ filled with dishonor ’ today?
Throughout these “last days, ” Jehovah has thwarted all efforts to eliminate his people.
As a result, opposers have been shamed.
Psalm 83: 16 foreshadowed this when it said: “Fill their faces with dishonor, that people may search for your name, O Jehovah. ”
In country after country, opponents have failed miserably in their effort to silence Jehovah’s Witnesses.
In those lands, the steadfastness and endurance of worshippers of the one true God have served as a witness to righthearted ones, and many have ‘ searched for Jehovah’s name. ’
In a number of lands where Jehovah’s Witnesses were once viciously persecuted, there are now tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of happy praisers of Jehovah.
What a triumph for Jehovah!
And how embarrassing for his enemies! ​ — Read Jeremiah 1: 19.
What critical situation faces mankind, and what words will we soon remember?
We know, of course, that the battle is not over.
And we continue to preach the good news ​ — even to opposers.
However, the opportunity now open to such opposers to repent and gain salvation will soon come to an end.
The sanctification of Jehovah’s name is far more important than human salvation.
(Read Ezekiel 38: 23.)
When the nations combine in the foretold earth - wide effort to destroy God’s people, we will remember these words of the psalmist’s prayer: “O may they be ashamed and be disturbed for all times, and may they become abashed and perish. ” ​ — Ps.
83: 17.
18, 19. (a) What awaits determined opposers of Jehovah’s sovereignty?
(b) How does the approaching final vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty affect you?
A humiliating end awaits determined opposers of Jehovah’s sovereignty.
God’s Word reveals that those who “do not obey the good news ” ​ — and for this reason are executed at Armageddon — ​ will suffer“ everlasting destruction. ”
Their destruction and the survival of those who worship Jehovah in truth will be convincing evidence that Jehovah is the only true God.
In the new world, that great victory will not be forgotten.
Those who come back in the “resurrection of... the righteous and the unrighteous ” will learn of Jehovah’s great act.
In the new world, they will see convincing evidence of the wisdom of living under Jehovah’s sovereignty.
And meek ones among them will quickly be convinced that Jehovah is the only true God.
What a marvelous future our loving heavenly Father has prepared for his faithful worshippers!
Are you not moved to pray that Jehovah will soon provide a final answer to the psalmist’s prayer to Jehovah: “May [your enemies] become abashed and perish; that people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth ”? ​ — Ps.
83: 17, 18.
Before considering this article, you would benefit from reading Psalm 83 in order to familiarize yourself with its contents.

What moved one psalmist to compose a heartfelt prayer?
Do You Take the Lead in Showing Honor?
“In showing honor to one another take the lead. ” ​ — ROM. 12: 10.
What is no longer common in many parts of the world?
IN SOME parts of the world, it is the custom for young children to honor adults by kneeling respectfully when in their company. In this way, they do not stand taller than those who are older.
In these communities, it is also viewed as an act of disrespect for a child to turn his or her back to an adult.
Although respect is shown in different ways in various cultures, such displays of respect remind us of the Mosaic Law.
This included the command: “Before gray hair you should rise up [in respect], and you must show consideration for the person of an old man. ”
Sadly, in many places it is no longer common to show honor to others.
In fact, disrespect is the order of the day.
God’s Word tells us to honor whom?
God’s Word puts a high value on showing honor.
It tells us to honor Jehovah and Jesus.
We are also commanded to show honor to family members and fellow believers as well as to some outside the congregation.
What are some ways in which we show that we honor Jehovah?
How do we show honor, or deep respect, to our Christian brothers and sisters?
Let us consider these and some related questions.
Honor Jehovah and His Name
What is one important way to honor Jehovah?
One important way to honor Jehovah is by showing proper respect for his name.
After all, we are “a people for his name. ”
It is truly an honor to bear the name of the almighty God, Jehovah.
The prophet Micah said: “All the peoples, for their part, will walk each one in the name of its god; but we, for our part, shall walk in the name of Jehovah our God to time indefinite, even forever. ”
We “walk in the name of Jehovah ” by striving to live each day in a way that reflects well on the name we bear.
As Paul reminded the Christians in Rome, if we do not live in harmony with the good news we preach, the name of God is “blasphemed, ” brought into disrepute. ​ — Rom. 2: 21 - 24.
How do you view the privilege of bearing witness to Jehovah?
We also honor Jehovah by our witnessing work.
In the past, Jehovah invited members of the nation of Israel to be his witnesses, but they failed to fulfill that role.
They often turned their backs on Jehovah and “pained even the Holy One of Israel. ”
Eventually, the nation lost Jehovah’s favor completely.
We today, though, are grateful for the privilege of bearing witness to Jehovah and making his name known.
We do so because we love him and long for his name to be sanctified.
How could we refrain from preaching when we know the truth about our heavenly Father and his purposes?
We feel as did the apostle Paul when he said: “Necessity is laid upon me.
Really, woe is me if I did not declare the good news! ” ​ — 1 Cor.
How is having faith in Jehovah related to having respect for him?
The psalmist David stated: “Those knowing your name will trust in you, for you will certainly not leave those looking for you, O Jehovah. ”
If we truly know Jehovah and look to his name with respect for what it stands for, we will trust in him just as did his faithful servants of old.
Having this trust and faith in Jehovah is yet another way to show him honor.
Note how God’s Word makes a connection between trusting in Jehovah and respecting him.
When ancient Israel failed to trust in Him, Jehovah asked Moses: “How long will this people treat me without respect, and how long will they not put faith in me for all the signs that I performed in among them? ”
The opposite also holds true.
By trusting in Jehovah to protect and sustain us even during trials, we show that we respect him.
What moves us to show deep respect for Jehovah?
Jesus indicated that respect for Jehovah must come from the inner person.
Speaking to those whose worship was not sincere, Jesus quoted Jehovah as saying: “This people honors me with their lips, yet their heart is far removed from me. ” Sincere respect for Jehovah springs from heartfelt love for him.
And we also keep in mind Jehovah’s promise: “Those honoring me I shall honor. ”
− 1 Sam.
2: 30.
Those Taking the Lead Show Respect for Others
(a) Why should brothers holding responsible positions show honor to those under their oversight?
(b) How did Paul show respect for fellow believers?
The apostle Paul admonished fellow believers: “In showing honor to one another take the lead. ”
In that regard, ones with weighty responsibilities do well to follow the example set by Paul.
(Read 1 Thessalonians 2: 7, 8.)
The brothers in the congregations Paul visited knew that he would never ask them to do things that he himself was unwilling to do.
Paul showed respect for fellow believers, and in turn he earned their respect.
When Paul said: “I entreat you, therefore, become imitators of me, ” we can be sure that many willingly responded because of his fine example. ​ — 1 Cor. 4: 16.
(a) What is one important way in which Jesus showed respect for his disciples?
(b) How can overseers today follow Jesus ’ example?
Another way in which a responsible brother shows respect for those under his oversight is by giving them reasons for the requests he makes or the directions he gives. By doing so, he imitates Jesus.
He said: “The harvest is great, but the workers are few.
Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest. ” Similarly, when he told his disciples to “keep on the watch, ” he gave them a reason.
He said: “Because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. ”
Time and again, Jesus told his disciples not only what they should do but also why they should do it.
In that way, he showed them respect and dignified them.
What a fine example for Christian overseers to follow!
Respect Jehovah’s Congregation and Its Direction
Of what is respect for the worldwide Christian congregation and its representatives a reflection?
Explain. To honor Jehovah, we also need to honor the worldwide Christian congregation, along with its representatives.
When we heed Scriptural counsel from the faithful slave class, we show respect for Jehovah’s arrangement.
In the first - century Christian congregation, the apostle John saw the need to censure those who showed a lack of respect for appointed ones.
(Read 3 John 9 - 11.)
John’s words show that there was a lack of respect not only for the individual overseers but also for their teaching and direction. Happily, most Christians were not like that.
While the apostles were alive, the brotherhood as a whole evidently showed deep respect for those taking the lead. ​ — Phil. 2: 12.
10, 11.
Explain from the Scriptures why it is proper that some have a measure of authority in the Christian congregation.
Some have reasoned that since Jesus told his disciples “all you are brothers, ” there should be no positions of authority in the Christian congregation.
However, both the Hebrew and the Greek Scriptures have numerous examples of men who exercised authority given to them by God.
The history of the patriarchs, judges, and kings among the ancient Hebrews provides ample evidence that Jehovah gives direction through human representatives.
When the people did not properly honor the appointed individuals, they were disciplined by Jehovah. ​ — 2 Ki.
1: 2 - 17; 2: 19, 23, 24.
In a similar way, first - century Christians acknowledged the authority of the apostles.
Paul, for example, gave direction to his brothers.
Nevertheless, he also willingly submitted to those who had authority over him.
Indeed, Paul had the proper view of authority in the Christian congregation.
What twofold lesson regarding authority can we learn from Biblical examples?
The lesson we learn is twofold.
First, it is Scriptural for “the faithful and discreet slave ” through its Governing Body to appoint men to positions of responsibility, and some men are appointed to exercise authority over other appointed men.
Second, all of us, including appointed men, should honor those who have authority over us.
What, then, are some practical ways in which we can honor those who hold positions of oversight in the worldwide Christian congregation?
Showing Respect for Traveling Overseers
How can we show respect for modern - day representatives of the Christian congregation?
Paul stated: “We request you, brothers, to have regard for those who are working hard among you and presiding over you in the Lord and admonishing you; and to give them more than extraordinary consideration in love because of their work.
Be peaceable with one another. ”
Traveling overseers are certainly to be counted among “those who are working hard. ”
Therefore, let us give them “more than extraordinary consideration. ”
One way to do so is by responding wholeheartedly to their counsel and encouragement.
When such an overseer conveys to us direction from the faithful slave class, the “wisdom from above ” will move us to be“ ready to obey. ” ​ — Jas. 3: 17.
How does the congregation give evidence of heartfelt respect for traveling overseers, and what is the result?
What, though, if we are directed to do things in a way that is different from what we are used to?
Showing respect may at times require that we fight the urge to object, “We don’t do things that way here ” or,“ That may work in other places but not in our congregation. ”
Instead, we strive to comply.
Keeping closely in mind that the congregation belongs to Jehovah and that Jesus is its Head will help us to do so.
When direction from a traveling overseer is received with joy and is implemented by the congregation, it is evidence of heartfelt respect.
The apostle Paul commended the brothers in Corinth for the respectful obedience they showed toward the direction that was given by the visiting elder, Titus.
Today, we can likewise be sure that the willingness with which we apply the guidance received from traveling overseers contributes greatly to the joy we experience in our preaching work. ​ — Read 2 Corinthians 13: 11.
“Honor Men of All Sorts ”
What are some ways in which we show respect for fellow believers?
Paul wrote: “Do not severely criticize an older man.
To the contrary, entreat him as a father, younger men as brothers, older women as mothers, younger women as sisters with all chasteness.
Honor widows that are actually widows. ”
Yes, God’s Word admonishes us to honor everyone in the Christian congregation.
What, though, if there is a personal difference between you and your brother or sister?
Will that hinder you from carrying out your obligation to respect your fellow Christian?
Or could you adjust your attitude by recognizing the spiritual qualities of that servant of God?
Those with authority especially should maintain a respectful view of their brothers ​ — never “lording it over... the flock. ”
Indeed, in the Christian congregation, which is identified by the heartfelt love that exists among its members, we have numerous opportunities to honor one another. ​ — Read John 13: 34, 35.
16, 17. (a) Why is it important to have respect not only for those to whom we preach but also for opposers?
(b) How do we “honor men of all sorts ”?
Of course, we do not limit our respect to those who are part of the Christian congregation.
Paul wrote to Christians in his day: “As long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all. ”
Granted, applying that principle can be a challenge if a workmate or a schoolmate treats us unkindly.
At such moments, we need to remember the words: “Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers. ”
Applying that counsel will help us to respond respectfully even to opposers.
Similarly, while we engage in the public ministry, a humble view of ourselves can help us to respond to all with “a mild temper and deep respect. ”
Even our appearance and dress can indicate that we respect those to whom we preach.
Indeed, whether we are dealing with our fellow believers or with those outside the congregation, we want to strive to apply the admonition: “Honor men of all sorts, have love for the whole association of brothers, be in fear of God, have honor for the king. ” ​ — 1 Pet.
2: 17.

What Will You Give to Keep Living?
“What will a man give in exchange for his soul? ” ​ — MATT.
16: 26. Why did Jesus reject Peter’s rebuke?
THE apostle Peter could not believe his ears. His beloved Leader, Jesus Christ, was saying “with outspokenness ” that He was soon to suffer and die!
In response, Peter ​ — doubtless with the best of intentions — ​ rebuked Jesus, saying: “Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this destiny at all. ”
Jesus turned his back on Peter and looked at the other disciples. Likely they too shared this mistaken opinion.
Then he said to Peter: “Get behind me, Satan!
You are a stumbling block to me, because you think, not God’s thoughts, but those of men. ” ​ — Mark 8: 32, 33; Matt. 16: 21 - 23.
How did Jesus define the requirements of true discipleship?
Jesus ’ next words may have helped Peter to see the reason for Jesus ’ strong reaction to his rebuke.
Jesus “called the crowd to him with his disciples ” and said:“ If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and follow me continually.
For whoever wants to save his soul will lose it; but whoever loses his soul for the sake of me and the good news will save it. ”
Jesus here used the word “soul ” to mean“ life. ”
Clearly, not only was he about to sacrifice his life but he also expected that those who followed him would have to be ready to sacrifice their lives in God’s service.
If they did so, they would receive a rich reward. ​ — Read Matthew 16: 27.
(a) What questions did Jesus ask his listeners?
(b) Of what might Jesus ’ second question have reminded his listeners?
On that same occasion, Jesus asked two thought - provoking questions: “Of what benefit is it for a man to gain the whole world and to forfeit his soul? ”
and, “What, really, would a man give in exchange for his soul? ”
The answer to the first question is obvious from a human standpoint. It is of no benefit for a man to gain the whole world if he loses his life, his soul. Possessions are useful only if one is alive to enjoy them.
Jesus ’ second question: “What, really, would a man give in exchange for his soul? ”
might have reminded his listeners of Satan’s allegation in the days of Job: “Everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. ”
For some who do not worship Jehovah, Satan’s words might be true. Many would do anything, abandon any principle, just to stay alive.
Christians, though, view things differently.
Why do Jesus ’ questions have deeper meaning for Christians?
We know that Jesus did not come to earth to give us health, wealth, and a long life in this world.
He came to open up the opportunity of living forever in the new world, and the prospect of that life is what we value highly.
A Christian would understand Jesus ’ first question to mean, “Of what benefit is it for a man to gain the whole world and to forfeit his hope of everlasting life? ”
The answer is, Of no benefit at all.
To help us answer Jesus ’ second question, we might well ask ourselves, ‘ How much am I willing to sacrifice now to make my hope of life in the new world sure? ’
Our answer to that question, as seen in our life course, reveals the strength of that hope in our hearts. ​ — Compare John 12: 25.
How can we receive the gift of everlasting life?
Of course, Jesus was not saying that everlasting life can be earned.
Life ​ — even our relatively brief life in this system of things — ​ is a gift.
We cannot purchase it or do anything to deserve it.
The only way we can receive the gift of everlasting life is to “put our faith in Christ Jesus ” and in Jehovah,“ the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him. ”
Nevertheless, faith must be demonstrated by actions, since “faith without works is dead. ”
Hence, when we further meditate on Jesus ’ question, we would do well to consider seriously how much we are willing to give up in this system of things and what we are willing to do in Jehovah’s service to demonstrate that our faith is truly alive.
“Christ Did Not Please Himself ”
What was Jesus ’ priority?
Instead of setting his sights on what the world of his day had to offer, Jesus focused on the important things and rejected the temptation of material self - interest.
His life was one of sacrifice and obedience to God.
Rather than please himself, he said: “I always do the things pleasing to [God]. ”
How far did Jesus go in order to please God?
7, 8. (a) What sacrifice did Jesus make, and how was he rewarded?
(b) What question should we ask ourselves?
On one occasion, Jesus said to his disciples: “The Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many. ”
Earlier, when Jesus began to warn his followers that he would soon have to “give his soul, ” Peter urged him to be kind to himself. Still, Jesus was not swayed.
He willingly gave up his soul, his perfect human life, for mankind.
As a result of his unselfish course, Jesus ’ own future was secure.
He was resurrected and “exalted to the right hand of God. ”
He thus became a wonderful example for us.
The apostle Paul counseled Christians in Rome “not to be pleasing ” themselves and reminded them that“ even the Christ did not please himself. ”
So, then, to what extent will we apply that apostolic counsel and give of ourselves in imitation of Christ?
Jehovah Desires Our Best
What does a Christian actually do when he dedicates himself to God?
In ancient Israel, the Mosaic Law stipulated that Hebrew slaves were to be freed either in the seventh year of servitude or during the Jubilee year. However, they had another option.
If a slave came to love his owner, he could choose to remain a slave in the household for the rest of his life. (Read Deuteronomy 15: 12, 16, 17.)
We make a similar choice when we dedicate ourselves to God.
We voluntarily agree to do God’s will, not follow our own inclinations.
In doing so, we demonstrate our deep love for Jehovah and our desire to serve him forever.
In what way are we God’s property, and how should that fact affect our thoughts and actions?
If you are currently studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses, sharing in preaching the good news, and attending Christian meetings, you are to be commended.
We hope that soon you will feel moved to dedicate yourself to Jehovah and ask the question that the Ethiopian asked Philip: “What prevents me from getting baptized? ”
Your relationship with God will then be like that of those Christians to whom Paul wrote: “You do not belong to yourselves, for you were bought with a price. ”
Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly, if we have dedicated ourselves to Jehovah, he is our Owner.
How important, then, to suppress selfish desires and “stop becoming slaves of men ”!
What a privilege it is to be a loyal servant for Jehovah to use as he pleases!
What sacrifice are Christians urged to offer, and what does that really mean, as illustrated by the sacrifices under the Mosaic Law?
Paul admonished fellow believers: “Present your bodies a sacrifice living, holy, acceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason. ”
Those words may have reminded Jewish Christians of the sacrifices that were a feature of their worship before they became followers of Jesus.
They would have known that under the Mosaic Law, animals offered on Jehovah’s altar had to be the best available.
Anything inferior was unacceptable.
The same is true when we present our bodies ‘ a living sacrifice. ’
We give Jehovah our best, not merely what is left after we have satisfied all our personal desires.
When we dedicate ourselves to God, we unreservedly give him our “souls, ” our lives ​ — including our strength, assets, and abilities.
What does that mean in a practical way?
Use Your Time Wisely
12, 13.
What is one way that we can give our best to Jehovah?
One way to give Jehovah our best is to use our time wisely. (Read Ephesians 5: 15, 16.)
That calls for self - control.
Influences from the world along with inherited imperfection incline us to use time purely for our own enjoyment or personal benefit.
True, “for everything there is an appointed time, ” including pleasurable relaxation and secular employment to enable us to fulfill our Christian obligations.
However, a dedicated Christian needs to stay balanced and use his time wisely.
When Paul visited Athens, he noted that “all Athenians and the foreigners sojourning there would spend their leisure time at nothing but telling something or listening to something new. ”
Today, many similarly waste their time.
Modern distractions include watching television, playing video games, and surfing the Internet.
More and more distractions increasingly compete for our time.
If we give in to them, we may neglect our spiritual needs.
We might even come to believe that we are too busy to care for “the more important things ” ​ — matters related to serving Jehovah. ​ — Phil.
What questions deserve our serious consideration?
Therefore, as a dedicated servant of Jehovah, ask yourself, ‘ Does my daily schedule include time for Bible reading, meditation, and prayer? ’
‘ Do I set aside time for preparing for Christian meetings?
Do I encourage others by giving comments during the meetings? ’
God’s Word states that Paul and Barnabas spent “considerable time speaking with boldness by the authority of Jehovah. ”
Could you adjust your circumstances in order to spend more time, even “considerable time, ” in the preaching work, perhaps serving as a pioneer? ​ — Read Hebrews 13: 15.
How do elders use their time wisely?
When the apostle Paul and Barnabas visited the Christian congregation in Antioch, “they spent not a little time with the disciples ” in order to encourage them.
Loving elders today likewise use much of their time to strengthen others.
In addition to their field ministry, elders work hard to shepherd the flock, search for lost sheep, assist the sick, and care for many other responsibilities within the congregation.
If you are a baptized brother, do your circumstances allow you to reach out for these additional privileges of service?
What are some ways that we can “work what is good toward... those related to us in the faith ”?
Many have found joy in helping to provide relief to those who have suffered loss through man - made or natural disasters.
For instance, one sister in her 60 ’ s who serves at Bethel traveled long distances on several occasions to volunteer as a relief worker.
Why did she use her vacation time in that way?
She says: “Although I have no special skills, it was a privilege to do whatever was needed.
I gained so much encouragement seeing the strong faith of my brothers and sisters who had suffered severe material losses. ”
Furthermore, thousands worldwide help to construct Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls.
By having a share in such activities, we unselfishly “work what is good toward... those related to us in the faith. ” ​ — Gal.
6: 10.
“I Am With You All the Days ”
What would you personally give in exchange for everlasting life?
Human society alienated from God is about to pass away.
Still, we do know that “the time left is reduced ” and“ the scene of this world is changing. ” (Read 1 Corinthians 7: 29 - 31.)
That gives added meaning to Jesus ’ question: “What, really, would a man give in exchange for his soul? ”
We will surely make whatever sacrifices Jehovah asks of us in order to gain “the real life. ”
Indeed, it is imperative to heed Jesus ’ admonition to ‘ follow him continually ’ and to ‘ seek first the kingdom. ’ ​ — Matt.
6: 31 - 33; 24: 13.
What confidence can we have, and why?
Granted, following Jesus is not always easy, and true to Jesus ’ warning, it has cost some their lives in this system of things.
Nevertheless, like Jesus, we avoid the temptation to ‘ be kind to ourselves. ’
We have faith in the assurance that he gave to his first - century anointed followers: “I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things. ”
Let us, then, to the fullest extent possible, use our time and abilities in sacred service.
As we do so, we demonstrate our confidence that Jehovah will preserve us through the great tribulation or restore us to life in the new world.
Thus we will have shown how highly we value the gift of life.

Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
Highlights From the Letters to Titus, to Philemon, and to the Hebrews
SOME time after being released from his first imprisonment in Rome in 61 C.E., the apostle Paul visits the island of Crete.
Noting the spiritual condition of the congregations there, he leaves Titus behind to strengthen them.
Later, likely from Macedonia, Paul writes a letter to Titus to guide him in his duties and to give apostolic backing to his work.
Earlier, shortly before his release from prison in 61 C.E., Paul wrote a letter to Philemon, a Christian brother living in Colossae.
It is a personal plea to a friend.
In about 61 C.E., Paul also wrote a letter to the Hebrew believers in Judea, which shows the superiority of Christianity over the Jewish system.
All three letters contain valuable counsel for us. ​ — Heb.
4: 12. REMAIN SPIRITUALLY HEALTHY
(Titus 1: 1 – 3: 15)
After providing guidance for the making of “appointments of older men in city after city, ” Paul counsels Titus to“ keep on reproving [the unruly] with severity, that they may be healthy in the faith. ”
He admonishes all in the congregations in Crete “to repudiate ungodliness... and to live with soundness of mind. ” ​ — Titus 1: 5, 10 - 13; 2: 12.
Paul gives further counsel to help the brothers in Crete to remain spiritually healthy. He instructs Titus to “shun foolish questionings... and fights over the Law. ” ​ — Titus 3: 9.
Scriptural Questions Answered:
1: 15 ​ — How can “all things ” be“ clean to clean persons, ” but unclean “to persons defiled and faithless ”?
The answer lies in understanding what Paul meant by “all things. ” He was speaking, not of things directly condemned in God’s written Word, but of matters in which the Scriptures allow varying responses from believers.
To a person whose thinking is in harmony with God’s standards, such things are clean.
It is the opposite with someone whose thinking is distorted and whose conscience is defiled.
3: 5 ​ — How are anointed Christians ‘ saved through a bath ’ and ‘ made new by holy spirit ’?
They are ‘ saved through a bath ’ in that God has bathed, or cleansed, them with the blood of Jesus on the merit of the ransom sacrifice.
They are ‘ made new by holy spirit ’ because they have become “a new creation ” as spirit - begotten sons of God. ​ — 2 Cor.
5: 17.
1: 10 - 13; 2: 15.
Christian overseers must display courage in correcting what is defective in the congregation.
2: 3 - 5.
As in the first century, mature Christian sisters today need to “be reverent in behavior, not slanderous, neither enslaved to a lot of wine, teachers of what is good. ”
In that way, they can be effective in privately instructing “the young women ” in the congregation.
3: 8, 14.
Keeping our “minds on maintaining fine works ” is“ fine and beneficial ” because it helps us to be fruitful in God’s service and keeps us separate from the wicked world.
EXHORT “ON THE BASIS OF LOVE ”
1 - 25)
Philemon is commended for being an example in “love and faith. ”
His being a source of refreshment to fellow Christians has given Paul “much joy and comfort. ” ​ — Philem.
4, 5, 7. Setting an example for all overseers, Paul handles the sensitive matter about Onesimus by giving, not an order, but exhortation “on the basis of love. ”
He tells Philemon: “Trusting in your compliance, I am writing you, knowing you will even do more than the things I say. ” ​ — Philem. 8, 9, 21.
Scriptural Questions Answered:
10, 11, 18 ​ — How did formerly “useless ” Onesimus become“ useful ”?
Onesimus was an unwilling slave who escaped from the household of Philemon in Colossae and fled to Rome.
Likely, Onesimus also stole from his master to finance this 900 - mile [1,400 km] journey.
Indeed, he was useless to Philemon.
In Rome, though, Onesimus was helped by Paul to become a Christian.
Now a spiritual brother, this formerly “useless ” slave became“ useful. ”
15, 16 ​ — Why did Paul not ask Philemon to grant freedom to Onesimus?
Paul desired to stick strictly to his commission to ‘ preach the kingdom of God and teach the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ. ’
Therefore, he chose to stay away from involvement in social issues, such as those concerning slavery. ​ — Acts 28: 31.
Philemon made his home available for Christian meetings.
It is a privilege to have a meeting for field service in our home. ​ — Rom. 16: 5; Col. 4: 15.
4 - 7.
We should take the initiative to commend fellow believers who are exemplary in faith and love.
15, 16.
Unfavorable developments in life should not be allowed to cause us undue anxiety.
The results can turn out to be beneficial, as in the case of Onesimus.
Paul expected Philemon to forgive Onesimus.
We are likewise expected to be forgiving toward a brother who may have offended us. ​ — Matt.
6: 14. “PRESS ON TO MATURITY ”
1: 1 – 13: 25)
To prove that faith in Jesus ’ sacrifice is superior to works of Law, Paul highlights the excellency of Christianity’s Founder, his priesthood, his sacrifice, and the new covenant.
This knowledge certainly must have helped Hebrew Christians to deal with the persecution that they suffered at the hands of the Jews.
Paul urges his Hebrew fellow believers to “press on to maturity. ” ​ — Heb. 6: 1.
How important is faith under the Christian arrangement?
“Without faith it is impossible to please [God] well, ” writes Paul.
He encourages the Hebrews: “Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, ” doing so in faith. ​ — Heb. 11: 6; 12: 1.
Scriptural Questions Answered:
2: 14, 15 ​ — Does Satan’s “having the means to cause death ” indicate that he can cause the premature death of anyone he chooses?
However, from the start of Satan’s course of wickedness in Eden, his lies have caused death because Adam sinned and passed sin and death on to the human family.
Furthermore, Satan’s earthly agents have persecuted servants of God to the point of death, even as they did Jesus.
But that does not mean that Satan has limitless power to kill anyone he wants.
If that were so, he would no doubt have wiped out Jehovah’s worshippers long ago.
Jehovah protects his people as a group and does not allow Satan to exterminate them.
Even if God permits some of us to die under Satan’s attacks, we can be confident that God will undo whatever harm is brought upon us.
4: 9 - 11 ​ — How do we “enter into [God’s] rest ”?
We “enter into that rest ” by desisting from doing works of self - justification and by accepting God’s provision for our salvation.
When we exercise faith in Jehovah and obediently follow his Son rather than pursue selfish interests, we enjoy refreshing and restful blessings every day. ​ — Matt.
11: 28 - 30.
9: 16 ​ — Who is “the human covenanter ” of the new covenant? Jehovah is the Maker of the new covenant, while Jesus is“ the human covenanter. ”
Jesus is the Mediator of that covenant, and by his death, he provided the sacrifice needed to validate it. ​ — Luke 22: 20; Heb. 9: 15.
11: 10, 13 - 16 ​ — What “city ” was Abraham awaiting?
This was not a literal city but a symbolic one.
Abraham was awaiting “heavenly Jerusalem, ” composed of Christ Jesus and his 144,000 corulers.
These corulers in their heavenly glory are also spoken of as “the holy city, New Jerusalem. ”
Abraham was looking forward to life under the rule of God’s Kingdom.
12: 2 ​ — What was “the joy that was set before [Jesus] ” for which“ he endured a torture stake ”?
It was the joy of seeing what his ministry would accomplish ​ — including the sanctification of Jehovah’s name, the vindication of God’s sovereignty, and the ransoming of the human family from death.
Jesus also looked ahead to the reward of ruling as King and serving as High Priest to the benefit of mankind.
13: 20 ​ — Why is the new covenant spoken of as being “everlasting ”?
For three reasons: (1) It will never be replaced, (2) its results are permanent, and (3) the “other sheep ” will continue to benefit from the new covenant arrangement after Armageddon. ​ — John 10: 16.
5: 14.
We should be diligent students of God’s Word, the Bible, and apply what we learn from it. There is no other way to have our “perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong. ” ​ — 1 Cor. 2: 10.
6: 17 - 19.
Having our hope solidly based on God’s promise and his oath will help us not to deviate from walking in the way of the truth.
12: 3, 4.
Rather than ‘ getting tired and giving out in our souls ’ because of minor trials or opposition that we may encounter, we should make progress toward maturity and improve our ability to endure trials.
We should be determined to resist “as far as blood, ” that is, to the point of dying. ​ — Heb. 10: 36 - 39.
12: 13 - 15.
We should not allow a “poisonous root, ” or any in the congregation who find fault with the way things are done, to prevent us from ‘ making straight paths for our feet. ’
12: 26 - 28.
The “things that have been made ” by hands other than God’s ​ — the entire present system of things, even the wicked“ heaven ” — ​ are to be shaken out of existence.
When that happens, only “the things not being shaken, ” that is, the Kingdom and its supporters, will remain.
How vital that we zealously proclaim the Kingdom and live by its principles!
13: 7, 17.
Keeping in focus this admonition to be obedient and submissive to the overseers in the congregations will help us to manifest a cooperative spirit.
See The Watchtower, October 15, 2007, pages 26 - 27.
A Widespread Belief
“I had nightmares of burning in hell!
I dreamed of being thrown into a fiery place and would wake up screaming.
Needless to say, I tried very hard not to sin. ” ​ — Arline.
DO YOU believe that hell is a place of torment reserved for sinners?
Many people do. For example, in 2005 a scholar at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland found that a third of the Scottish clergy believed that those separated from God would suffer “eternal mental anguish in hell. ”
A fifth believed that those in hell would suffer physical torment. In many countries, belief in hell is widespread. For instance, in the United States, a Gallup poll conducted in 2007 found that about 70 percent of those surveyed believe in hell.
Even in predominantly secular countries, belief in hell lingers.
A Gallup poll in 2004 found that in Canada, 42 percent of the people believed in hell. And in Great Britain, 32 percent were sure that hell exists.
What the Clergy Teach
Rather, they promote a definition similar to that expressed in a Catechism of the Catholic Church, published in 1994.
“The chief punishment of hell, ” states that reference,“ is eternal separation from God. ”
Even so, belief that hell is a place of mental or physical suffering persists.
Those who promote this doctrine claim that such a teaching is based on the Bible.
R. Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, asserts: “It’s simply a fact of Scripture. ”
Why Does It Matter What You Believe?
If hell really is a place of torment, you certainly should fear it.
However, if this teaching is not true, religious leaders who teach the doctrine create confusion and cause needless mental anguish to those who believe them.
They also defame God.
What does God’s Word, the Bible, say on this subject?
The following articles will use both Catholic and Protestant Bible translations to answer three questions: (1) What really happens to a person at death?
(2) What did Jesus teach about hell?
(3) How can learning the truth about hell affect you?
What Really Happens at Death?
“All souls are immortal, even those of the wicked...
Punished with the endless vengeance of quenchless fire, and not dying, it is impossible for them to have [an end] put to their misery. ” ​ — Clement of Alexandria, a writer of the second and third centuries C.E.
LIKE Clement, those who promote the teaching that hell is a place of torment assume that the human soul is immortal.
Does the Bible support this teaching?
Consider what God’s Word says in answer to the following questions.
Did the first man, Adam, have an immortal soul?
The Protestant translation known as the King James Version, or Authorized Version, says about the creation of Adam: “The LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. ”
Notice that this scripture does not say that Adam was given a soul.
What eventually happened to Adam after he sinned?
The punishment God decreed was not eternal torment in hell.
Rather, the Catholic New American Bible renders God’s pronouncement this way: “By the sweat of your face shall you get bread to eat, until you return to the ground, from which you were taken; for you are dirt, and to dirt you shall return. ”
(Italics ours; Genesis 3: 19) God’s declaration gives no hint that any part of Adam survived his death.
When Adam died, Adam the soul died.
Does any human possess an immortal soul?
God told the prophet Ezekiel: “The soul who sins is the one who will die. ”
The apostle Paul wrote: “Through one person [Adam] sin entered the world, and through sin, death, and thus death came to all, inasmuch as all sinned. ”
If all humans sin, then the logical conclusion is that all souls die.
Does a dead soul know or feel anything?
God’s Word says: “The living know that they are to die, but the dead no longer know anything. ”
Describing what happens to a man at death, the Bible states: “He returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. ”
If the dead “no longer know anything ” and their“ thoughts perish, ” how could they sense any torment in hell?
Jesus Christ likened death, not to some form of consciousness, but to sleep.
* Some may object, though, saying that Jesus did teach that hell was hot and that sinners would be cast into hellfire. Let us consider what Jesus actually did say about hell. [Footnote]
For a more detailed discussion, see the article “What We Learn From Jesus ​ — About Hope for the Dead ” on pages 16 and 17.
What Did Jesus Teach About Hell?
“If your eye causes you to sin, ” said Jesus,“ get rid of it. You would be better off to go into God’s kingdom with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell.
The worms there never die, and the fire never stops burning. ” ​ — MARK 9: 47, 48, Contemporary English Version.
On another occasion, Jesus spoke of a judgment period when he would say to the wicked: “Depart from me, you accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. ”
He also said that these ones will “go off to eternal punishment. ” ​ — MATTHEW 25: 41, 46, The New American Bible.
AT FIRST glance, the above words of Jesus may seem to promote the teaching of hellfire.
Obviously, Jesus did not intend to contradict God’s Word, which clearly states: “The dead no longer know anything. ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 9: 5, NAB.
To what, then, was Jesus referring when he spoke of a person’s being thrown “into hell ”?
Is “the eternal fire ” Jesus warned of literal or symbolic?
In what sense do the wicked “go off to eternal punishment ”?
Let us examine these questions one at a time.
To what was Jesus referring when he spoke of a person’s being thrown “into hell ”?
The original Greek word translated “hell ” at Mark 9: 47 is Geʹen·na.
This word comes from the Hebrew Geh Hin·nomʹ, meaning “Valley of Hinnom. ” The Valley of Hinnom hugged the outskirts of ancient Jerusalem.
In the days of the Israelite kings, it was used for child sacrifice ​ — a disgusting practice that God condemned.
God said that he would execute those who performed such an act of false worship. The Valley of Hinnom would then be called “the valley of slaughter, ” where“ the carcases of this people ” would lie unburied.
Jehovah thus foretold that the Valley of Hinnom would become a place, not for the torture of live victims, but for the mass disposal of dead bodies.
In Jesus ’ day, the inhabitants of Jerusalem used the Valley of Hinnom as a garbage dump.
They threw the bodies of some vile criminals into this dump and kept a fire constantly burning there to dispose of the refuse and the carcasses.
When Jesus spoke of the undying worms and unquenchable fire, he was apparently alluding to Isaiah 66: 24.
Regarding “the carcases of the men that have transgressed against [God], ” Isaiah says that“ their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched. ”
(KJ) Jesus and his listeners knew that these words in Isaiah referred to the treatment of the carcasses of those not deserving a burial.
Therefore, Jesus used the Valley of Hinnom, or Gehenna, as a fitting symbol of death without hope of a resurrection.
He drove this point home when he warned that God “can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. ”
Gehenna is a symbol of eternal death, not eternal torture.
Is “the eternal fire ” Jesus warned of literal or symbolic?
Note that “the eternal fire ” mentioned by Jesus and recorded at Matthew 25: 41 was prepared“ for the devil and his angels. ”
Do you think that literal fire can burn spirit creatures?
Or was Jesus using the term “fire ” symbolically?
Certainly “the sheep ” and“ the goats ” mentioned in the same discourse are not literal; they are word pictures that represent two types of people.
The eternal fire that Jesus spoke of completely burns up the wicked in a figurative sense.
In what sense do the wicked “go off to eternal punishment ”?
Although most translations use the word “punishment ” at Matthew 25: 46, the basic meaning of the Greek word koʹla·sin is“ checking the growth of trees, ” or pruning, cutting off needless branches.
So while the sheeplike ones receive everlasting life, the unrepentant goatlike ones suffer “eternal punishment, ” being forever cut off from life.
What Do You Think?
Jesus never taught that humans have an immortal soul.
However, he often did teach about the resurrection of the dead.
Why would Jesus say that the dead would be resurrected if he believed that their souls had not died?
Jesus did not teach that God would maliciously torture the wicked forever. Rather, Jesus said: “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life. ”
Why would Jesus imply that those who did not believe in him would die?
If he really meant that they would live forever, suffering misery in a fiery hell, would he not have said so?
The doctrine that hell is a place of torment is not based on the Bible.
Rather, it is a pagan belief masquerading as a Christian teaching.
(See the box “A Brief History of Hell, ” on page 6.)
No, God does not torture people eternally in hell.
How can learning the truth about hell affect your attitude toward God?
[Box on page 6]
A BRIEF HISTORY OF HELL
ROOTS IN PAGAN BELIEFS: The ancient Egyptians believed in a fiery hell.
The Book Ȧm - Ṭuat, dated 1375 B.C.E., speaks of those who “shall be cast down headlong into the pits of fire; and... shall not escape therefrom, and... shall not be able to flee from the flames. ”
Greek philosopher Plutarch (c. 46 - 120 C.E.) wrote of those in the world below: “[They] raised a cry of wailing as they underwent fearful torments and ignominious and excruciating chastisements. ”
SECTS OF JUDAISM ARE INFECTED: The historian Josephus (37 - c. 100 C.E.) reported that the Essenes, a Jewish sect, believed that “the souls are immortal, and continue forever. ”
He added: “This is like the opinion of the Greeks...
They allot to bad souls a dark and tempestuous den, full of never - ceasing punishments. ”
INTRODUCED INTO “CHRISTIANITY ”: In the second century C.E., the apocryphal book Apocalypse of Peter said of the wicked:“ There is spread out for them unquenchable fire. ”
It also stated: “Ezrael, the angel of wrath, brings men and women with the half of their bodies burning and casts them into a place of darkness, the hell of men; and a spirit of wrath chastises them. ”
During the same time period, writer Theophilus of Antioch quotes the Greek prophetess Sibyl as foretelling the punishments of the wicked: “Upon you burning fire shall come, and ever ye shall daily burn in flames. ”
These are among the words that Theophilus says are “true, and useful, and just, and profitable to all men. ”
HELLFIRE USED TO JUSTIFY VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE AGES: Mary I, queen of England (1553 - 1558), known as “Bloody Mary ” for burning nearly 300 Protestants at the stake, reportedly said:“ As the souls of heretics are hereafter to be eternally burning in hell, there can be nothing more proper than for me to imitate the Divine vengeance by burning them on earth. ”
A RECENT DEFINITION: In recent years, some denominations have revised their teaching about hell.
For example, the Doctrine Commission of the Church of England said in 1995: “Hell is not eternal torment, but it is the final and irrevocable choosing of that which is opposed to God so completely and so absolutely that the only end is total non - being. ”
[Box / ​ Picture on page 7]
WHAT IS “THE LAKE OF FIRE ”?
Revelation 20: 10 says that the Devil will be cast into “the lake of fire ” and“ tormented day and night for ever and ever. ”
(King James Version) If the Devil were to be tortured for all eternity, God would have to preserve him alive, but the Bible says that Jesus will “destroy him. ”
The symbolic fiery lake represents “the second death. ”
This is not the death first mentioned in the Bible ​ — death because of Adam’s sin — ​ death from which one may be released by a resurrection.
Because the Bible does not say that “the lake of fire ” would release those in it,“ the second death ” must mean another kind of death, an irreversible one.
In what sense are those in “the lake of fire ” tormented eternally?
At times, “to torment ” can mean“ to restrain ” someone.
Once when Jesus confronted the demons, they cried out: “Art thou come hither to torment us [restrain us in the abyss] before the time? ”
So all of those in “the lake ” will suffer the“ torment ” of everlasting restraint, or “the second death. ”
How Does Learning the Truth About Hell Affect You?
THOSE who teach that hell is a place of torment promote a gross misrepresentation of Jehovah God and his qualities.
Granted, the Bible does say that God will destroy the wicked.
But righteous anger is not God’s dominant quality.
God is not malicious or vindictive.
He even asks: “Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? ”
If God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked, how could he for all eternity delight in watching these ones being tormented?
God’s preeminent quality is love.
Indeed, “the LORD is good to all; he has compassion on all he has made. ”
In return, God wants us to develop heartfelt love for him. ​ — Matthew 22: 35 - 38.
Fear of Hell or Love of God ​ — Which Motivates You?
By contrast, a person who learns the truth about God and comes to love him will develop a healthy fear of him.
“The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; prudent are all who live by it, ” explains Psalm 111: 10.
(The New American Bible) This fear of God is, not abject terror, but awe of and profound reverence for the Creator. It engenders in us a healthy fear of displeasing him.
Consider how learning the truth about hell affected Kathleen, a 32 - year - old former drug user.
Her life had been filled with parties, violence, self - hate, and immorality.
She admitted: “I would look at my one - year - old daughter and think, ‘ Look at what I’m doing to her.
I will burn in hell for this. ’ ” Kathleen tried to stop using drugs, but nothing worked.
“I wanted to be good, ” she said,“ but everything in my life and in the world was so pathetic. There seemed no reason to be good. ”
Kathleen then met Jehovah’s Witnesses.
“I learned that there is no burning hell.
The Scriptural evidence made perfect sense, ” said Kathleen.
“Knowing that I would not have to burn in hell was a tremendous relief. ”
But she also learned of God’s promise that humans could live forever on an earth cleansed of wickedness.
“I now had a real hope ​ — to live forever in Paradise! ” she exclaimed.
Would Kathleen be able to stop abusing drugs without the threat of a fiery hell hanging over her?
She related: “When I had a strong craving for drugs, I would pray, begging Jehovah God for help.
I thought of his view of such defiling habits, and I did not want to disappoint him.
He answered my prayers. ”
This fear of displeasing God enabled Kathleen to break free from her addictions.
Yes, cultivating love for God and a healthy fear of him ​ — not fear of torment in hell — ​ can motivate us to do God’s will in order to enjoy lasting happiness.
The psalmist wrote: “Blessed is every one that feareth Jehovah, that walketh in his ways. ” ​ — Psalm 128: 1, American Standard Version.
[Box / ​ Pictures on page 9]
WHO WILL BE RELEASED FROM HELL?
Some Bible translations create confusion by rendering two different Greek words ​ — Geʹen·na and Haiʹdes — ​ as just the one word, “hell. ”
In the Bible, the term Geʹen·na refers to total destruction, without hope of a resurrection.
By contrast, those in Haiʹdes, or Hades, do have the hope of being resurrected.
Thus, after Jesus died and was raised up, the apostle Peter assured his audience that Jesus “was not left in hell. ”
The word translated “hell ” in this verse is the Greek word Haiʹdes.
Jesus did not go to some fiery place. Hades, or “hell, ” was the grave.
But Jesus is not the only one whom God releases from Hades.
In connection with the resurrection, the Bible says: “Death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them. ”
Emptying “hell ” will mean restoring to life all those whom God judges worthy of a resurrection.
What a marvelous hope for the future ​ — seeing our dead loved ones brought back from the grave!
Jehovah, the God of infinite love, will do this.
Draw Close to God
A Lover of Justice
Hebrews 10: 26 - 31
HAVE you ever been a victim of unjust or cruel treatment, perhaps by someone who appeared to get away with it and showed no remorse?
Few things can be harder to cope with than such gross inequity, especially if the pain was inflicted by someone whom you expected to love you and care for you.
You may wonder, ‘ Why does God allow such things to happen? ’
* The truth is that Jehovah God hates all injustice.
His Word, the Bible, assures us that hard - hearted practicers of sin will not escape divine retribution.
Let us consider the apostle Paul’s words recorded at Hebrews 10: 26 - 31.
Paul writes: “If we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left. ” (Verse 26) Willful sinners are most reprehensible. Why?
First, they do not commit an isolated sin in a moment of weakness ​ — the kind of mistake we all make at times because we are imperfect.
They make a practice of sin. Second, their sins are intentional.
As The Bible in Basic English puts it, they “do evil on purpose. ” Deeply ingrained badness fills their heart.
Third, their sins are not the result of ignorance.
They have an “accurate knowledge of the truth ” about God’s will and ways.
How does God view unrepentant, malicious sinners?
“There is no longer any sacrifice for sins left, ” says Paul.
The sacrifice of Christ ​ — God’s gift to humankind — ​ covers the sins we commit because of our imperfection.
In God’s eyes, they have “trampled upon the Son of God and... esteemed as of ordinary value the blood of ” Jesus.
(Verse 29) By their course, they show contempt for Jesus and treat his blood “as a cheap thing, ” as having no more value than that of any imperfect human.
(Today’s English Version) Such ingrates are in no position to benefit from Christ’s sacrifice.
What can the wicked expect?
The God of justice has promised: “Vengeance is mine; I will recompense. ” (Verse 30) Let all who are bent on practicing sin at the expense of others beware.
No one can flout God’s righteous laws with impunity.
Often, their wicked ways catch up with them.
At the latest, they will stand before God in the near future when he comes to rid this earth of all injustice.
Paul warns: “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. ” ​ — Verse 31.
Learning that Jehovah God does not condone willful sin is both comforting and reassuring, especially for those who have been hurt by a hardened wrongdoer.
We can confidently leave the avenging of wrong squarely in the hands of God, who hates all injustice.
For a discussion of why God has allowed suffering, see pages 106 - 114 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach?
What We Learn From Jesus
About Hope for the Dead
Jesus resurrected at least three persons, thus demonstrating that there is hope for the dead.
To understand the hope for the dead, we must first comprehend the cause and origin of death.
Why Do We Get Sick and Die?
When Jesus forgave people their sins, they were cured.
For example, when confronted with a paralyzed man, Jesus said: “‘ Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Get up and walk?
However, in order for you to know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins — ’ then he said to the paralytic: ‘ Get up, pick up your bed, and go to your home. ’ ”
So sin is the cause of sickness and death.
Our inherited sinful condition originated with the first man, Adam. ​ — Luke 3: 38; Romans 5: 12.
Why Did Jesus Die?
Jesus never sinned.
Therefore, he did not deserve to die.
By dying in place of us, Jesus paid the price of our sins.
He said that his blood would “be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins. ” ​ — Matthew 26: 28.
Jesus also said: “The Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many. ”
Jesus called the price he paid “a ransom ” because it released others from death.
Jesus also said: “I have come that they might have life and might have it in abundance. ”
To understand the hope for the dead completely, we must also know about their present condition.
What Happens at Death?
When Jesus ’ friend Lazarus died, Jesus described what happens at death.
He said to his disciples: “‘ Lazarus our friend has gone to rest, but I am journeying [to Bethany] to awaken him from sleep. ’...
They imagined he was speaking about taking rest in sleep.
At that time, therefore, Jesus said to them outspokenly: ‘ Lazarus has died. ’ ”
Thus, Jesus made it clear that the dead are sleeping, unconscious. ​ — John 11: 1 - 14.
When Jesus resurrected him, his friend Lazarus had been dead for four days.
Yet, the Bible records no comment from Lazarus about his experience during that time.
While dead, Lazarus was unconscious and knew nothing. ​ — Ecclesiastes 9: 5, 10; John 11: 17 - 44.
What Is the Hope for the Dead?
The dead will come back to life with the prospect of living forever.
Jesus said: “The hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his [Jesus ’] voice and come out. ” ​ — John 5: 28, 29.
This hope is an expression of God’s love.
Jesus said: “God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life. ” ​ — John 3: 16; Revelation 21: 4, 5.

Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe That They Are the Only Ones Who Will Be Saved?
Jehovah’s Witnesses think that they have found the true religion.
If they did not think so, they would change their beliefs.
Like adherents of many religious faiths, Jehovah’s Witnesses hope to be saved.
However, they also believe that it is not their job to judge who will be saved.
Ultimately, God is the Judge. He decides. ​ — Isaiah 33: 22.
God’s Word reveals that those who would be saved must not only want salvation but also cooperate with the Savior.
To illustrate: Suppose that a hiker becomes lost in a wilderness.
He desperately wants to find his way out. Will he perish, or will he survive?
The outcome depends on the way he responds to help.
Out of pride, he may refuse the help of a rescuer, or savior.
On the other hand, he could humbly accept help and reach safety.
In a similar way, salvation belongs to those who cooperate with mankind’s Rescuer, Jehovah God.
Salvation is a gift from God, yet not all people will attain it.
God’s Son, Jesus, said: “Not everyone saying to me, ‘ Lord, Lord, ’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will. ” ​ — Matthew 7: 21.
Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that God saves only those who exercise faith in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus and closely follow Jesus ’ teachings.
Consider three important requirements for salvation that are revealed in God’s Word.
(1) “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves, ” Jesus told his companions.
Jesus ’ own example of giving his life in behalf of others stressed the importance of love.
Those who love others are demonstrating a quality vital for salvation.
(2) “I have made your name known to them, ” said Jesus in prayer to his Father.
Jesus knew how important God’s personal name, Jehovah, was to his Father.
Jesus prayed for his Father’s name to “be sanctified. ”
Sanctifying God’s name includes knowing that name and treating it as important and holy.
Like Jesus, those seeking salvation need to use God’s name.
They also need to teach others about God’s name and qualities.
In fact, only those calling on God’s name will be saved. ​ — Romans 10: 13.
(3) “My kingdom is no part of this world, ” Jesus said to Pontius Pilate.
Few today demonstrate faith in God’s Kingdom, or government, of which Jesus is King.
Instead, they place their trust in human institutions.
By contrast, those who will be saved loyally support God’s Kingdom and teach others about how it will liberate all faithful mankind. ​ — Matthew 4: 17.
After learning some of the requirements for salvation, Jesus ’ disciples said: “Who possibly can be saved? ”
Jesus answered: “The things impossible with men are possible with God. ”
Jehovah’s Witnesses diligently try to meet these requirements for salvation. They also work hard to help others to be saved.

Help Those Who Stray From the Flock
“Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost. ” ​ — LUKE 15: 6.
How has Jesus proved to be a loving shepherd?
JEHOVAH’S only - begotten Son, Jesus Christ, is called “the great shepherd of the sheep. ”
The Scriptures foretold his coming and showed that he was a unique Shepherd who sought to find the “lost sheep ” of Israel.
Moreover, as a literal shepherd might give his life in order to protect his sheep, Jesus died as a ransom sacrifice for sheeplike ones who would avail themselves of his sacrifice. ​ — John 10: 11, 15; 1 John 2: 1, 2.
What may have caused some Christians to become inactive?
Sadly, some who seemed to appreciate Jesus ’ sacrifice and made a dedication to God no longer associate with the Christian congregation. Discouragement, health problems, or other factors may have weakened their zeal and caused them to become inactive.
However, only as part of God’s flock can they enjoy the serenity and happiness that David spoke of in the 23rd Psalm.
For instance, he sang: “Jehovah is my Shepherd.
I shall lack nothing. ”
Those in the flock of God lack nothing in a spiritual way, but that is not the happy lot of sheep who have strayed.
Who can assist them?
How can aid be provided?
Indeed, what can be done to help them return to the flock?
Who Can Help?
How did Jesus show what is needed to rescue lost sheep of God’s pasturage?
Earnest effort is required to rescue lost sheep of God’s pasturage.
Jesus illustrated this when he said: “If a certain man comes to have a hundred sheep and one of them gets strayed, will he not leave the ninety - nine upon the mountains and set out on a search for the one that is straying?
And if he happens to find it, I certainly tell you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety - nine that have not strayed.
Likewise it is not a desirable thing with my Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish. ”
Who can help sheeplike individuals who have strayed from the flock?
4, 5.
Elders need to have what attitude toward God’s flock?
If Christian elders are to help sheep who have strayed, they must bear in mind that the flock of God is a congregation of people dedicated to Jehovah ​ — yes, a precious ‘ flock of God’s pasturage. ’
Such dear sheep need tender care, and this means that loving shepherds must take a personal interest in them.
Making friendly shepherding calls on them can be very effective.
Loving encouragement that a shepherd gives them may build them up spiritually and increase their desire to return to the flock. ​ — 1 Cor.
8: 1. Shepherds of God’s flock have the duty to search for sheep who have strayed and then to try to help them.
The apostle Paul reminded Christian elders from ancient Ephesus of their shepherding responsibilities when he said: “Pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers, to shepherd the congregation of God, which he purchased with the blood of his own Son. ”
Similarly, the apostle Peter gave anointed older men this exhortation: “Shepherd the flock of God in your care, not under compulsion, but willingly; neither for love of dishonest gain, but eagerly; neither as lording it over those who are God’s inheritance, but becoming examples to the flock. ” ​ — 1 Pet.
5: 1 - 3. Why do God’s sheep especially need the care of shepherds today?
Christian shepherds need to imitate “the fine shepherd, ” Jesus.
He was deeply concerned about God’s sheep and stressed the importance of caring for them when he told Simon Peter to ‘ shepherd His little sheep. ’
(Read John 21: 15 - 17.)
Especially do the sheep need such care today, for the Devil has intensified his efforts to break the integrity of those dedicated to God.
Satan takes advantage of fleshly weaknesses and uses the world in an attempt to lead Jehovah’s sheep into sinful activities.
Inactive ones are particularly vulnerable and therefore need assistance in order to apply the admonition to ‘ walk by spirit. ’
Helping such sheep calls for prayerful reliance on God, the guidance of his spirit, and skillful use of his Word. ​ — Prov.
3: 5, 6; Luke 11: 13; Heb.
4: 12.
How important is it for elders to shepherd sheeplike ones in their care?
A shepherd in ancient Israel used a long curved staff, or crook, to guide his flock.
As the sheep entered or left the pen, they would ‘ pass under the crook ’ and could thus be counted by the shepherd.
A Christian shepherd likewise needs to know and keep track of the flock of God under his care.
(Compare Proverbs 27: 23.)
Therefore, shepherding is one of the important matters discussed by the body of elders. This includes making arrangements to help sheep who have strayed.
Jehovah himself said that he would search for his sheep and give them the care they needed.
So God is pleased when elders take similar steps in an effort to help sheep who have strayed to return to the flock.
In what ways can elders give the sheep personal attention?
When a fellow believer is physically sick, the visit of a shepherd of God’s flock can be a source of joy and encouragement.
The same can be the case when a spiritually ailing sheep is given personal attention.
Elders may read scriptures, review an article, discuss meeting highlights, pray with the inactive one, and so forth.
They can point out that members of the congregation would be delighted to see him come back to congregation meetings.
A visit, a telephone call, or a letter can mean so much!
Giving personal help to a sheep missing from the flock can also increase the joy of the compassionate Christian shepherd.
A Cooperative Effort
9, 10.
Why would you say that concern for a sheep who has strayed is not limited to the elders?
We live in busy and critical times, so it is possible that we might not notice that a fellow believer is drifting away from the congregation.
Yet, Jehovah’s sheep are precious in his sight.
Every one of them has value, as does each member, or part, of the human body.
Hence, all of us need to show concern for our brothers and truly care for one another.
Do you have such an attitude?
Although the elders take the lead in searching for and helping sheep who have strayed, concern for missing fellow believers is not limited to Christian overseers.
Others can cooperate with these shepherds. We can and should offer encouragement and spiritual aid to our brothers and sisters who need help to return to the flock.
How may such assistance be given?
11, 12.
How might you be privileged to assist one who needs some spiritual assistance?
In some cases, the elders may arrange for experienced Kingdom publishers to conduct a personal Bible study with inactive ones who express a desire to be given assistance.
The purpose of such efforts is to rekindle in such ones “the love [they] had at first. ”
These fellow believers can be built up and strengthened spiritually by considering material they missed while they were absent from the congregation.
If the elders invite you to study with a fellow believer needing some spiritual assistance, pray that Jehovah direct and bless your efforts.
Indeed, “roll your works upon Jehovah himself and your plans will be firmly established. ”
Meditate on Bible texts and faith - strengthening points that you can use in discussions with those needing spiritual help.
Reflect on the apostle Paul’s excellent example. (Read Romans 1: 11, 12.)
Paul longed to see Christians in Rome in order to impart some spiritual gift to them so that they might be made firm.
He also looked forward to an interchange of encouragement.
Should we not have that spirit when we seek to help sheep who have strayed from the flock of God?
What might you discuss with an inactive one?
During your discussions, you might ask, “How did you learn the truth? ”
Reminisce about past joys, encouraging the inactive one to speak about delightful experiences he has had at the meetings, in the preaching work, and at conventions.
Comment on the happy times you may have had together in Jehovah’s service.
Speak about your joy in drawing close to Jehovah. Express your gratitude for the way that God provides for us as his people ​ — especially by giving us comfort and hope in our tribulations. ​ — Rom. 15: 4; 2 Cor. 1: 3, 4.
14, 15.
It may be helpful to remind inactive ones of what blessings they once enjoyed?
Quite likely, it will be beneficial to remind the inactive one of some of the blessings he once enjoyed as a result of close association with the congregation.
For instance, there was the blessing of growing in knowledge of God’s Word and purposes.
When he ‘ walked by spirit, ’ it was no doubt easier for him to resist temptations to sin.
In turn, a clean conscience enabled him to approach Jehovah in prayer and to enjoy ‘ the peace of God that excels all thought and that guards our hearts and mental powers. ’
Keep such points in mind, show sincere interest, and by all means lovingly encourage your spiritual brother or sister to return to the flock. ​ — Read Philippians 2: 4.
Suppose you are an elder making a shepherding call. You might encourage an inactive married couple to reflect on the time when they first learned the truth from God’s Word.
How wonderful, reasonable, satisfying, and spiritually liberating the truth was!
How their hearts swelled with gratitude for what they were learning about Jehovah, his love, and his splendid purposes!
(Compare Luke 24: 32.)
Remind them of the close relationship with Jehovah and the wonderful privilege of prayer enjoyed by dedicated Christians.
Earnestly encourage inactive ones to respond again to “the glorious good news of the happy God, ” Jehovah. ​ — 1 Tim. 1: 11.
Continue to Show Them Love
Cite an example to show that efforts to provide spiritual help really are effective.
Do the foregoing suggestions really work?
For instance, one young person who started as a Kingdom publisher when he was 12 years old became inactive at the age of 15.
He later became active, however, and has been in the full - time service for over 30 years. His spiritual recovery was largely due to the assistance given him by a Christian elder.
How much that spiritual help was appreciated!
17, 18.
What qualities will help you to assist someone who has strayed from the flock of God?
It is love that motivates Christians to assist inactive ones to return to the congregation.
Regarding his followers, Jesus said: “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves. ”
Yes, love is an identifying mark of true Christians.
Should not that love be expressed for baptized Christians who may have become inactive?
It certainly should! But providing needed help may call for the exercise of various godly qualities.
If you are to help someone who has strayed from the flock of God, what qualities might you need to display?
Besides love, you may need to show compassion, kindness, mildness, and long - suffering.
Depending on the circumstances, you may also need to be forgiving.
Paul wrote: “Clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion, kindness, lowliness of mind, mildness, and long - suffering. Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. Even as Jehovah freely forgave you, so do you also.
But, besides all these things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union. ” ​ — Col.
3: 12 - 14.
Why is it worthwhile to make the effort to help sheeplike ones return to the Christian fold?
The next study article in this issue will consider reasons why some stray from God’s flock.
It will also show how those returning can expect to be received.
As you study that article and reflect on this one, be assured that any effort you make with the hope of helping sheeplike ones return to the Christian fold is worthwhile.
In the present system of things, many people spend an entire lifetime trying to amass wealth, but just one life is worth much more than all the money in the world.
Jesus emphasized this in his illustration of the lost sheep.
May you bear that point in mind as you make an earnest and urgent effort to help Jehovah’s dear sheeplike ones who have strayed to return to the flock.
How Would You Answer?
• What responsibility do Christian shepherds have with respect to sheeplike ones who have strayed from the flock?
• How may you be able to help those who are not now associating with the congregation?

Help Them Return Without Delay!
“Whom shall we go away to?
You have sayings of everlasting life. ” ​ — JOHN 6: 68.
What did Peter say when many disciples abandoned Jesus?
JESUS CHRIST was once abandoned by many disciples who rejected one of his teachings.
“You do not want to go also, do you? ”
Peter replied: “Lord, whom shall we go away to?
You have sayings of everlasting life. ”
There was nowhere else to go.
Judaism had no “sayings of everlasting life ” then, and such sayings certainly cannot be found today in Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion.
For any who have strayed from God’s flock but who want to please Jehovah, “it is high time to awake ” and return to the fold. ​ — Rom. 13: 11, King James Version.
What should be kept in mind regarding confidential or judicial matters?
Jehovah demonstrated concern for the lost sheep of Israel. (Read Ezekiel 34: 15, 16.)
Similarly, Christian elders have a desire and a duty to help a sheeplike one who has strayed from the flock.
If they assign a publisher to study with an inactive person desiring help, what should be done if the conductor learns that the individual has committed a serious sin?
Instead of giving counsel about any judicial or confidential matter, the publisher should suggest that he speak to the elders.
If he fails to do so, the publisher himself should inform the elders. ​ — Lev.
5: 1; Gal.
6: 1.
How did the man with 100 sheep react when a lost one was found?
In the preceding article, reference was made to Jesus ’ illustration about a man who had 100 sheep.
When one was missing from the fold, he left the 99 and searched for the lost sheep. How that man rejoiced when he found it!
We have similar joy upon the return of one of God’s sheep who has been missing from the flock.
Motivated by love, elders and other members of the congregation have probably visited the inactive one.
They too want to see the person come back to the fold and enjoy God’s support, protection, and blessing.
If they have an opportunity to be helpful in this regard, what can they do?
What can be discerned from Galatians 6: 2, 5?
Perhaps they can encourage a person to return to the congregation by kindly showing him that Jehovah loves His sheep and requires only things that we can do. These include studying the Scriptures, attending Christian meetings, and preaching the good news of the Kingdom.
It may be appropriate to read Galatians 6: 2, 5 and mention that Christians can help to bear the burdens of one another, but “each one will carry his own load ” of spiritual responsibility.
No one else can be faithful to God for us. Have “Anxieties of Life ” Taken a Toll?
5, 6. (a) Why is it important that we listen carefully to the expressions of inactive fellow believers?
(b) How may you be able to help inactive ones to see that not associating with God’s people has been detrimental to them?
To discern how to help inactive fellow believers, elders and other mature publishers need to listen carefully as such individuals make heartfelt expressions.
Suppose you are an elder visiting a married couple who are absent from the congregation because the “anxieties of life ” have taken a toll. Financial problems or increased family responsibilities may have caused them to slip into spiritual inactivity.
They may feel a need for relief, but you might point out that isolation is not the answer.
(Read Proverbs 18: 1.)
You might tactfully ask them: “Are you happier since you stopped attending meetings?
Is your family life better?
Is the joy of Jehovah still your stronghold? ” ​ — Neh.
8: 10.
Reflecting on such questions may help the inactive ones to see that because of their lack of association with the congregation, their spirituality and happiness have diminished.
It may be possible to help them realize that failure to preach the good news has resulted in the loss of joy.
So, then, what would be the wise course for them to take?
What can we encourage those who have strayed from the flock to do?
Jesus said: “Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life...
Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these things that are destined to occur. ”
Those who have strayed from the flock but who want to enjoy the happiness they once knew can be encouraged to pray for holy spirit and divine help and to act in harmony with their prayers. ​ — Luke 11: 13.
Were They Stumbled?
8, 9.
How might an elder reason with one who was stumbled?
Because humans are imperfect, personality clashes occur, and this may stumble an individual.
Some have been stumbled when a respected person in the congregation acted in an ungodly manner.
If an inactive one has been affected in such a way, the visiting elder might point out that Jehovah does not cause anyone to stumble.
So why should anyone sever his or her relationship with God and His people?
Instead, should one not keep on serving God, confident that “the Judge of all the earth ” knows what took place and will handle matters in the right way?
If a person literally stumbled and fell, he would not deliberately remain in that position without even trying to get up.
In an effort to be of spiritual help, an elder might mention that with the passing of time, some find that what stumbled them no longer seems very important.
In fact, the stumbling block may not exist any longer.
If a person is stumbled because he has received discipline, prayerful meditation may cause him to conclude that he himself was at least partially in the wrong and should not have allowed the discipline to stumble him. ​ — Ps.
119: 165; Heb.
12: 5 - 13.
Was It a Problem With a Teaching?
10, 11.
What reasoning may be effective in trying to help one who had a different understanding of some Bible teaching?
Some may have left God’s flock because they did not agree with some Scriptural teaching.
The Israelites freed from Egyptian bondage “forgot [God’s] works ” on their behalf and“ did not wait for his counsel. ”
It may be helpful to remind an inactive one that “the faithful and discreet slave ” is dispensing excellent spiritual food.
That is how the person originally learned the truth.
So why should he not be determined to walk in the truth again? ​ — 2 John 4.
When endeavoring to help those who have strayed from God’s flock, the elder might refer to the disciples who abandoned Jesus because of rejecting one of his teachings.
By cutting off association with Christ and his faithful followers, they lost their spirituality and their joy.
Have those who stopped associating with the Christian congregation found another place where there is rich spiritual food?
No, for there is none!
Was Improper Conduct Involved?
12, 13.
If someone who has strayed from the flock admits that he has committed serious sin, how may it be possible to help him?
Some individuals stop preaching and attending meetings because they have committed a serious sin.
They may feel that if they confess their wrongdoing to the elders, they will be disfellowshipped.
But they will not be expelled from the congregation if they have discontinued the unscriptural practice and are genuinely repentant.
Instead, they will be welcomed back, and the elders will give them the spiritual help they need.
If you are a mature publisher who has been assigned to help an inactive person, what should you do if he tells you that he has engaged in serious misconduct?
As noted earlier, rather than involve yourself further in the situation, recommend that he approach the elders.
If he does not wish to do so, you will be showing your concern for Jehovah’s name and the spiritual welfare of the congregation by acting in harmony with divine direction respecting such matters.
(Read Leviticus 5: 1.)
The elders will know how to assist anyone desiring to return and live in accord with God’s will.
Loving discipline may be required.
If the person acknowledges that he has sinned against God, has ceased to engage in wrongdoing, and is truly repentant, the elders will help him, and he can receive Jehovah’s forgiveness. ​ — Isa.
1: 18; 55: 7; Jas.
5: 13 - 16.
A Son’s Return Brings Joy
In your own words, relate Jesus ’ illustration regarding the prodigal son.
When seeking to assist a sheep who has strayed, the one assigned to help might refer to Jesus ’ illustration recorded at Luke 15: 11 - 24.
In that parable, a young man squanders his inheritance on loose living.
He eventually comes to abhor the debauched life he has been leading.
His stomach is empty, he is homesick, and he has made up his mind ​ — he is going home!
When he is still far off, his father sees him, runs and falls upon his son’s neck, tenderly kisses him, and is filled with joy.
Reflecting on this illustration may motivate one who has drifted away to return to the fold.
Since this system of things will soon be destroyed, he should ‘ come home ’ without delay.
Why do some drift away from the congregation?
Most who drift away from the congregation are not exactly like the prodigal son. With some, drifting takes place gradually, just as a boat that is adrift slowly floats farther from land.
Others become so weighed down with anxieties that they lose sight of spiritual things.
Still others allow themselves to be stumbled by someone associated with the congregation, or they leave because they do not agree with a certain Scriptural teaching.
A few become involved in unscriptural conduct.
However, the points presented in connection with each of these matters may help you to assist those who have left the fold for these or other reasons to return before it is too late.
“Welcome Home, Son! ”
16 - 18. (a) How did one elder help a brother who had been inactive for years?
(b) Why had this brother become inactive, how was he helped, and how was he received by the congregation?
One Christian elder says: “Our local body of elders is very interested in calling on those who are inactive.
I thought about a brother I had studied with and helped to come to a knowledge of the truth.
He had been inactive for about 25 years and was going through a very difficult situation, so I explained how applying the spiritual principles from the Bible could help him.
After some time, he began coming to the Kingdom Hall and agreed to have a personal Bible study to help strengthen his resolve to come back to the flock. ”
Why did the brother become inactive?
He admits: “I started giving more attention to worldly matters than to spiritual things.
Then I stopped studying, engaging in the ministry, and attending meetings.
The next thing I knew, I was no longer a part of the Christian congregation.
But I was helped to return by the personal and sincere interest the elder displayed. ”
This brother’s problems began to subside after he accepted a personal Bible study.
He says, “I realized that what was missing in my life was the love and guidance of Jehovah and his organization. ”
How was this brother received in the congregation?
He says: “I feel like the prodigal son spoken of by Jesus Christ.
In fact, one of our elderly sisters who was there 30 years ago and is still going strong said to me, ‘ Welcome home, Son! ’
That really touched my heart.
I was truly home.
And I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the love, warmth, patience, and interest shown to me by that elder and the entire congregation.
Their love for Jehovah and neighbor truly helped me to return to the flock. ”
Urge Them to Take Action Today!
19, 20.
How can you encourage inactive ones to return to the flock without delay, and how can you show them that God does not expect too much of us?
We are living in the last days, and the end of the present system of things is imminent.
Therefore, encourage inactive ones to attend Christian meetings. Urge them to start attending immediately.
Point out that Satan is trying to destroy their relationship with God and make them think that relief from life’s burdens can come by abandoning true worship.
You can assure them that only by being Jesus ’ faithful followers can they enjoy true refreshment. ​ — Read Matthew 11: 28 - 30.
Remind inactive ones that God expects us to do what we can.
When Lazarus ’ sister Mary was criticized for anointing Jesus with expensive perfumed oil shortly before his death, he said: “Let her alone....
She did what she could. ”
Jesus praised the needy widow who made a very small contribution at the temple. She also did what she could.
Most of us can attend Christian meetings and share in the Kingdom - preaching work.
With Jehovah’s help, many of those now inactive will be able to do the same things.
21, 22.
Of what can you assure those who return to Jehovah?
If a sheeplike one who has strayed from the flock fears facing his brothers again, you might remind him of the rejoicing that occurred when the prodigal son came home.
Those returning to the congregation are a cause of similar joy.
Encourage them to act now to oppose the Devil and draw close to God. ​ — Jas.
4: 7, 8.
A joyful welcome awaits those returning to Jehovah.
Their past experiences in God’s service undoubtedly brought them great joy.
Untold future blessings await those who return to the flock without delay!

Maintain a Scriptural View of Health Care
“You must love Jehovah your God... with your whole mind and with your whole strength. ” ​ — MARK 12: 30.
What did God originally purpose for mankind?
JEHOVAH GOD’S original purpose for human creatures did not include sickness and death.
Adam and Eve were placed in the garden of Eden, or “paradise of pleasure, ”“ to cultivate it and to take care of it, ” not for a mere 70 or 80 years, but for eternity.
If that first human couple had remained faithful to Jehovah and had lovingly submitted to his sovereignty, they would never have experienced ill health, frailty, and death.
2, 3. (a) How is old age depicted in the book of Ecclesiastes?
(b) Who is responsible for Adamic death, and how will its effects be undone?
Ecclesiastes chapter 12 paints a vivid picture of “the calamitous days ” that accompany old age in the case of imperfect humans. (Read Ecclesiastes 12: 1 - 7.)
White hair is compared to the blossom of “the almond tree. ”
Legs are likened to “men of vital energy ” that now bend and totter.
Ladies who go to a window in search of light and find only darkness are a fitting illustration of dimming eyesight.
Since some teeth are missing, “the grinding women have quit working because they have become few. ”
Shaky legs, failing eyesight, and toothless gums are certainly not what God originally purposed for mankind.
Moreover, death inherited from Adam is one of “the works of the Devil ” that God’s Son will undo by means of his Messianic Kingdom.
The apostle John wrote: “For this purpose the Son of God was made manifest, namely, to break up the works of the Devil. ” ​ — 1 John 3: 8.
Reasonable Concern Is Natural
Why are Jehovah’s servants reasonably concerned about their health, but of what are they aware?
At the present time, some of Jehovah’s servants find themselves faced with the problems of ill health and aging that are common to sinful mankind.
Reasonable concern about our health under such circumstances is natural and even beneficial.
Do we not want to serve Jehovah ‘ with our whole strength ’?
While seeking to remain reasonably healthy, however, we should be realistic and recognize that there is very little that we can do to slow down the aging process or avoid all sickness.
What lesson can we draw from the way faithful servants of God have dealt with sickness?
Many faithful servants of Jehovah have had to contend with health problems.
Epaphroditus was one of these.
The apostle Paul’s loyal companion Timothy had frequent bouts of stomach trouble for which Paul recommended the use of “a little wine. ”
Paul himself had to deal with “a thorn in the flesh, ” perhaps an eye affliction or some other physical ailment for which there was no medical cure at that time.
Regarding his “thorn in the flesh, ” Paul made fervent pleas to Jehovah. (Read 2 Corinthians 12: 8 - 10.)
God did not miraculously relieve Paul of the “thorn in the flesh. ”
Instead, God strengthened him to endure it.
Jehovah’s power thus became manifest in Paul’s weakness.
Could this case contain a lesson for us?
6, 7.
Why should we avoid excessive concern over our health?
As you know, Jehovah’s Witnesses accept medical help and various forms of treatment.
often contains articles on health matters.
And although we do not endorse any particular treatment, we appreciate the help and cooperation of health - care professionals.
Of course, we are aware that perfect health is not yet attainable.
Therefore, we know that it is wise to avoid letting our health become an obsession or a constant concern.
Our attitude should differ from that of those who have “no hope, ” who think that this life is all there is and who will resort to any therapy in an attempt to cure their ailments.
We are determined not to forfeit Jehovah’s approval in an effort to save our present life, for we are convinced that if we remain faithful to God, we will “get a firm hold on the real life, ” everlasting life in his promised new system of things. ​ — 1 Tim. 6: 12, 19; 2 Pet.
3: 13. We avoid excessive concern over our health for another reason. Being inordinately concerned about our health could lead to our becoming self - centered.
Paul warned against this danger when he urged the Philippians to be “keeping an eye, not in personal interest upon just [their] own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others. ”
It is proper to take reasonable care of ourselves, but the keen interest we show in our brothers and in the people to whom we bring “this good news of the kingdom ” will prevent us from being preoccupied with our physical well - being. ​ — Matt.
24: 14. What might undue concern over our health lead us to do?
The danger exists that a Christian might let health concerns push Kingdom interests into the background.
Obsession with health care could also lead us to try to impose on others our personal opinions regarding the value of some diet, therapy, or food supplement.
In this regard, consider the principle embodied in Paul’s words: “Make sure of the more important things, so that you may be flawless and not be stumbling others up to the day of Christ. ” ​ — Phil. 1: 10.
What Is More Important?
What is one of the more important things that we should not neglect, and why?
If we are making sure of the more important things, we will be having an active share in the work of spiritual healing.
It is accomplished by preaching and teaching the Word of God.
This joyful activity benefits us and those whom we teach.
The Watchtower and Awake!
magazines occasionally include articles regarding our spiritual brothers and sisters who have serious illnesses.
These accounts sometimes explain how those individuals cope with their problems or even temporarily take their minds off them by seeking to help others come to know Jehovah and his wonderful promises.
Why does our choice of therapies matter?
When faced with a health problem, each adult Christian must “carry his own load ” of responsibility in choosing treatment.
But we should remember that our choice of therapy matters to Jehovah.
Just as respect for Bible principles moves us to “abstain... from blood, ” so our deep regard for God’s Word should impel us to avoid resorting to therapies that could harm us spiritually or affect our relationship with Jehovah.
Some diagnostic and therapeutic procedures border on the use of the uncanny.
Jehovah disapproved of apostate Israelites who resorted to “uncanny power, ” or spiritistic practices.
He declared: “Stop bringing in any more valueless grain offerings.
Incense ​ — it is something detestable to me.
New moon and sabbath, the calling of a convention ​ — I cannot put up with the use of uncanny power along with the solemn assembly. ”
A period of illness surely is no time to do something that might hinder our prayers and jeopardize our relationship with God. ​ — Lam.
3: 44.
“Soundness of Mind ” Essential
11, 12.
How does “soundness of mind ” come into play when we are selecting health care?
When we are sick, we cannot expect Jehovah to heal us miraculously, but we can pray for wisdom in choosing treatment.
We should seek to be guided in our choice by Scriptural principles and good sense.
When the case is serious, it may be wise to consult more than one specialist if that is possible, in line with the thought expressed at Proverbs 15: 22, which states: “There is a frustrating of plans where there is no confidential talk, but in the multitude of counselors there is accomplishment. ”
The apostle Paul urged fellow believers to “live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things. ” ​ — Titus 2: 12.
Many individuals find themselves in a situation similar to that of a sick woman in Jesus ’ day.
At Mark 5: 25, 26, we read: “There was a woman subject to a flow of blood twelve years, and she had been put to many pains by many physicians and had spent all her resources and had not been benefited but, rather, had got worse. ”
Jesus healed that woman and dealt with her compassionately.
In desperation, some Christians have been tempted to choose diagnostic or therapeutic methods that go against the principles of pure worship.
13, 14. (a) How could Satan use our choice of health treatments to breach our integrity?
(b) Why should we keep away from anything that even borders on the occult?
Satan will resort to any means to distract us from true worship.
Just as he uses sexual immorality and materialism to cause some to stumble, he tries to breach the integrity of others by means of questionable treatments that amount to the use of occult powers and spiritism.
We pray to Jehovah for deliverance from “the wicked one ” and from“ every sort of lawlessness. ”
So we should not play into Satan’s hands by exposing ourselves to anything that borders on spiritism and the occult. ​ — Matt.
6: 13; Titus 2: 14.
Jehovah forbade the Israelites to practice divination and magic.
Paul lists the “practice of spiritism ” among“ the works of the flesh. ”
Furthermore, “those practicing spiritism ” will have no part in Jehovah’s new system of things.
Clearly, then, anything that smacks of spiritism is detestable to Jehovah.
“Let Your Reasonableness Become Known ” 15, 16.
Why do we need wisdom in choosing health care, and what wise counsel did the first - century governing body give?
In view of the foregoing, if we have doubts about some diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, we would be wise to reject it.
Of course, the mere fact that we personally are unable to explain how a health technique works does not in itself mean that it involves some form of spiritism.
Keeping a Scriptural view of health care requires divine wisdom and calls for good judgment on our part.
In Proverbs chapter 3, we find this admonition: “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding.
In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight....
Safeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability, and they will prove to be life to your soul. ” ​ — Prov.
3: 5, 6, 21, 22.
While endeavoring to stay as healthy as possible, then, we must be careful not to lose God’s favor as we try to cope with sickness or the aging process.
In health care, as in other matters, we should ‘ let our reasonableness become known to all men ’ by living in accord with Bible principles.
In a vitally important letter, the first - century governing body instructed Christians to abstain from idolatry, blood, and fornication.
That letter included the assurance: “If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper. ”
In what way?
Reasonable Care With Perfect Health in View
How have we benefited physically from our adherence to Bible principles?
Each of us does well to ask himself, ‘ Do I appreciate the extent to which I have personally prospered because of my strict observance of Bible principles regarding blood and fornication? ’
Think, too, of the benefits that have come to us as a result of our efforts to “cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit. ”
By adhering to Bible standards regarding personal hygiene, we avoid many physical ailments.
We prosper because of shunning the spiritually and physically defiling use of tobacco and illicit drugs.
Consider also the health benefits that result from moderation in eating and drinking.
(Read Proverbs 23: 20; Titus 2: 2, 3.)
Although such factors as rest and exercise may contribute to our general well - being, we have especially prospered physically and spiritually because we have accepted Scriptural guidance.
What should be our main concern, and to the fulfillment of what prophecy regarding health can we look forward?
Above all, we should take care of our spiritual health and strengthen our precious relationship with our heavenly Father, the Source of our “life now and that which is to come ” in his promised new world.
In God’s new world, full spiritual and physical healing will be brought about by means of forgiveness of sins on the basis of Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice.
The Lamb of God, Jesus Christ, will guide us to “fountains of waters of life, ” and God will wipe out every tear from our eyes.
Then, too, we will experience the fulfillment of this thrilling prophecy: “No resident will say: ‘ I am sick. ’ ” ​ — Isa.
33: 24.
While taking reasonable care of our health, of what can we be assured?
We are convinced that our deliverance is near, and we eagerly await the day when Jehovah will reverse the process of human sickness and death.
In the meantime, we are assured that our loving Father will help us to endure the burden of our aches and pains because ‘ he cares for us. ’
Let us, therefore, take care of our health but always in accord with the clear guidelines contained in God’s inspired Word!
A list of some such articles appears in the box on page 17 of The Watchtower of September 1, 2003.
• Who is responsible for sickness, and who will relieve us of the effects of sin?
• Although it is normal for us to be concerned about our health, what should we avoid?
• Why does our choice of therapy matter to Jehovah?
• With regard to our health, how can we benefit from adhering to Bible principles?

Despite health problems, Jehovah’s people find joy in the ministry
“Oppose the Devil ” as Jesus Did
“Oppose the Devil, and he will flee from you. ” ​ — JAS. 4: 7.
What opposition did Jesus know he would face on earth, and with what outcome?
JESUS CHRIST knew that he would face opposition from the Devil.
This fact was apparent from what God said to the serpent and thus to the wicked spirit rebel speaking through it: “I shall put enmity between you and the woman [the heavenly part of Jehovah’s organization] and between your seed and her seed.
He [Jesus Christ] will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel. ”
Jesus ’ being bruised in the heel meant that he would suffer only a temporary blow by being killed while on earth, for Jehovah would resurrect him to heavenly glory.
But the bruising of the serpent in the head would mean that the Devil would receive a death blow from which he would never recover. ​ — Read Acts 2: 31, 32; Hebrews 2: 14.
Why was Jehovah confident that Jesus would successfully resist the Devil?
Jehovah was confident that Jesus would successfully fulfill his assignment and oppose the Devil while on the earth.
Why could Jehovah be so sure of this?
Because he had created Jesus in heaven ages earlier, had observed him, and knew that this “master worker ” and“ firstborn of all creation ” was obedient and faithful.
So when Jesus was sent to the earth and the Devil was allowed to test him to the point of death, God was confident that His only - begotten Son would come off victorious. ​ — John 3: 16.
Jehovah Preserves His Servants
What is the Devil’s attitude toward Jehovah’s servants?
Jesus referred to the Devil as “the ruler of this world ” and warned His disciples that they would be persecuted, even as he had been.
The world, lying in the power of Satan the Devil, hates true Christians because they serve Jehovah and are preachers of righteousness.
The Devil particularly targets the remnant of anointed ones who will eventually rule with Christ in his heavenly Kingdom.
Satan also targets the many Witnesses of Jehovah who have the hope of living forever on a paradise earth.
God’s Word warns us: “Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone. ” ​ — 1 Pet. 5: 8.
What proves that God’s people have successfully opposed the Devil in our time?
As an organization enjoying the support of Jehovah God, we successfully oppose the Devil.
Consider these facts: In the past 100 years, some of the most ferocious dictatorships in history have tried to stamp Jehovah’s Witnesses out of existence.
But the number of Witnesses continues to grow and has now reached nearly 7,000,000 in over 100,000 congregations throughout the world.
The cruel dictatorships that persecuted Jehovah’s people are the ones that have been stamped out of existence!
How has Isaiah 54: 17 proved true in the case of Jehovah’s servants?
Speaking to the congregation of ancient Israel as his “woman, ” God promised:“ Any weapon whatever that will be formed against you will have no success, and any tongue at all that will rise up against you in the judgment you will condemn.
This is the hereditary possession of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness is from me. ”
That promise has proved reliable in the case of Jehovah’s people throughout the earth during these “last days. ”
We continue to oppose the Devil, and no weapon that he tries to use to wipe out God’s people is successful, for Jehovah is on our side. ​ — Ps.
118: 6, 7.
What does Daniel’s prophecy tell us about the future of the Devil’s rulership?
At the rapidly approaching end of this entire wicked system of things, all aspects of Satan’s rule will be crushed out of existence.
Writing under divine inspiration, the prophet Daniel foretold: “In the days of those kings [existing in our day] the God of heaven will set up a kingdom [in heaven] that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people.
It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms [now existing], and it itself will stand to times indefinite. ”
When that happens, both satanic rule and rule by imperfect humans will disappear. Every aspect of the Devil’s system of things will be gone forever, and God’s Kingdom will rule unopposed over all the earth. ​ — Read 2 Peter 3: 7, 13.
How do we know that Jehovah’s servants as individuals can successfully oppose the Devil?
There is no doubt that Jehovah’s organization will be preserved and will prosper spiritually. (Read Psalm 125: 1, 2.)
How about us?
The Bible tells us that we can succeed in opposing the Devil, even as Jesus did.
Indeed, the prophecy that Christ gave through the apostle John shows that despite satanic opposition, “a great crowd ” of those having an earthly hope will survive this system’s end.
According to the Scriptures, they cry out: “Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb [Jesus Christ]. ”
Anointed ones are spoken of as conquering Satan, and their companions, the “other sheep, ” also successfully oppose him.
But this requires diligent effort and earnest prayer for ‘ deliverance from the wicked one. ’ ​ — Matt. 6: 13.
The Perfect Example in Opposing the Devil
What was the first recorded temptation that the Devil used against Jesus in the wilderness, and how did Christ respond?
The Devil tried to break the integrity of Jesus.
In the wilderness, Satan used temptations in an effort to get Jesus to compromise His obedience to Jehovah.
However, Jesus set a perfect example in opposing Satan. After fasting for 40 days and 40 nights, Jesus likely had a strong desire to eat.
“If you are a son of God, ” said Satan,“ tell these stones to become loaves of bread. ” But Jesus refused to make use of his God - given power for personal benefit.
Instead, Jesus said: “It is written, ‘ Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth. ’ ” ​ — Matt. 4: 1 - 4; Deut. 8: 3.
Why must we resist the Devil’s attempts to exploit our natural physical desires?
Today, the Devil seeks to exploit the natural physical desires of Jehovah’s servants.
We must therefore be resolute in resisting illicit sexual temptations, which are especially common in this immoral world.
God’s Word emphatically states: “What!
Do you not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom?
Do not be misled.
Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men... will inherit God’s kingdom. ”
Clearly, then, people who live immoral lives and refuse to change will not be allowed to live in God’s new world.
According to Matthew 4: 5, 6, what was another temptation that Satan used in an attempt to break Jesus ’ integrity?
Concerning one of the temptations Jesus experienced in the wilderness, the Scriptures state: “The Devil took him along into the holy city, and he stationed him upon the battlement of the temple and said to him: ‘ If you are a son of God, hurl yourself down; for it is written,“ He will give his angels a charge concerning you, and they will carry you on their hands, that you may at no time strike your foot against a stone. ” ’ ”
Supposedly, this would result in a spectacular display of Jesus ’ Messiahship.
In reality, though, it would have been an improper, arrogant act that would not have had God’s approval and support.
Once more, Jesus maintained his integrity to Jehovah and responded by quoting a scripture.
He said: “Again it is written, ‘ You must not put Jehovah your God to the test. ’ ” ​ — Matt.
4: 7; Deut. 6: 16.
Satan may tempt us to seek glory in various ways. He may try to induce us to imitate worldly fads in dress and grooming or to engage in questionable entertainment.
But if we were to ignore Bible counsel and imitate the world, could we expect the angels to shield us from the bad effects of such a course?
Although King David repented of his sins involving Bath - sheba, he was not shielded from the consequences of his actions.
Let us not put Jehovah to the test in improper ways, perhaps by cultivating friendship with the world. ​ — Read James 4: 4; 1 John 2: 15 - 17.
What was the temptation mentioned at Matthew 4: 8, 9, and how did God’s Son respond?
Still another temptation that the Devil used in the wilderness involved an offer to give Jesus political power.
Satan showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and their glory and said: “All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me. ”
What an unscrupulous attempt to get the worship belonging to Jehovah and to induce Jesus to prove unfaithful to God!
By meditating on the desire to be worshipped, that once loyal angel had become the sinful, covetous, and grossly evil tempter Satan the Devil.
In stark contrast, however, Jesus was determined to remain faithful to his heavenly Father and therefore declared: “Go away, Satan!
For it is written, ‘ It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service. ’ ”
Thus Jesus again opposed the Devil in clear and definite terms.
God’s Son wanted no part of Satan’s world and would never worship that wicked one! ​ — Matt. 4: 10; Deut.
6: 13; 10: 20. “Oppose the Devil, and He Will Flee From You ”
13, 14. (a) By showing Jesus all the kingdoms of the world, what was the Devil offering him?
(b) How does Satan attempt to corrupt us?
By showing Jesus all the kingdoms of the world, the Devil was offering him unprecedented human power.
Satan hoped that what Jesus saw would appeal to him and convince him that he could become the earth’s most powerful political leader.
Today, the Devil does not offer us kingdoms, but he does attempt to corrupt our hearts through our eyes, ears, and minds. The Devil is in control of this world.
Hence, he controls its media. It is not surprising, therefore, that the world’s viewing, listening, and reading material is saturated with immorality and violence.
This world’s advertising elements try to build in us a desire for a flood of consumer goods that we do not need.
By such means, the Devil constantly tempts us with materialistic attractions that can appeal to our eyes, ears, and minds.
But when we refuse to view, listen to, and read Scripturally unacceptable material, we are in effect saying: “Go away, Satan! ”
We thus imitate Jesus in being firm and decisive in our rejection of Satan’s unclean world.
The fact that we are no part of Satan’s world is also seen in how we courageously identify ourselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses and Christ’s followers at work, at school, in the neighborhood, and among our relatives. ​ — Read Mark 8: 38.
Why does opposing Satan mean being continually alert?
After the Devil’s third unsuccessful attempt to get Jesus to compromise His integrity to God, “the Devil left him. ”
However, Satan did not intend to stop tempting Jesus, for we are told: “So the Devil, having concluded all the temptation [in the wilderness], retired from him until another convenient time. ”
When we succeed in opposing the Devil, we should thank Jehovah. But we should also seek God’s continued help, for the Devil will return to tempt us at another time convenient for him ​ — and not necessarily when we may be expecting a temptation.
Hence, we must remain alert at all times, ready to persevere in rendering sacred service to Jehovah regardless of the tests we must face.
Jehovah gives us what powerful force, and why should we pray for it?
To help us in our efforts to oppose the Devil, we should pray for and will receive the most powerful force in the universe ​ — God’s holy spirit.
It will enable us to do things that would be impossible for us to do in our own strength.
Jesus assured his followers of the availability of God’s spirit by saying: “If you, although being [imperfect and thus comparatively] wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him! ”
Let us continue praying to Jehovah for his holy spirit. With this most powerful force backing us up in our determination to oppose the Devil, we will be able to come off victorious.
In addition to regular and fervent prayer, we need to put on the complete suit of spiritual armor from God in order ‘ to stand firm against the machinations, or crafty acts, of the Devil. ’ ​ — Eph. 6: 11 - 18, ftn. What joy helped Jesus resist the Devil?
Something else helped Jesus to oppose the Devil, and it can help us too.
The Bible states: “For the joy that was set before [Jesus] he endured a torture stake, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. ”
We can have similar joy by upholding Jehovah’s sovereignty, honoring his holy name, and keeping the reward of everlasting life before us.
What joy we will experience when Satan and all his works are obliterated forever and ‘ the meek ones themselves possess the earth and find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace ’!
Therefore, keep on opposing the Devil, as Jesus did. ​ — Read James 4: 7, 8.

Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
Highlights From the Letters of James and of Peter
NEARLY 30 years after Pentecost of 33 C.E., the disciple James ​ — a half brother of Jesus — ​ writes a letter to “the twelve tribes ” of spiritual Israel.
His objective: to exhort them to be strong in faith and to show endurance when facing trials.
He also provides counsel to correct disturbing conditions that have developed in the congregations.
Just prior to Roman Emperor Nero’s campaign of persecution in 64 C.E., the apostle Peter writes his first letter addressed to Christians, encouraging them to stand firm in the faith.
In his second letter, penned soon after the first, Peter encourages his fellow believers to pay attention to God’s word and warns them about the coming of Jehovah’s day.
Indeed, we can benefit from paying attention to the messages of the letters of James and of Peter. ​ — Heb.
4: 12. GOD GIVES WISDOM TO THOSE “ASKING IN FAITH ”
1: 1 – 5: 20)
“Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, ” writes James,“ because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life. ”
To those who “keep on asking in faith, ” Jehovah grants wisdom needed to endure trials. ​ — Jas. 1: 5 - 8, 12.
Faith and wisdom are also needed by those who “become teachers ” in the congregation.
After identifying the tongue as “a little member ” capable of ‘ spotting up the whole body, ’ James warns of worldly tendencies that can damage one’s relationship with God.
He also outlines the steps anyone spiritually sick should take in order to recover. ​ — Jas.
3: 1, 5, 6; 5: 14, 15.
Scriptural Questions Answered:
2: 13 ​ — In what way does ‘ mercy exult triumphantly over judgment ’?
When it comes to rendering an account for ourselves to God, he takes into consideration the mercy we have shown toward others and forgives us on the basis of the ransom sacrifice of his Son.
James is not quoting any specific verse. However, these divinely inspired words are possibly based on the general thought behind such scriptures as Genesis 6: 5; 8: 21; Proverbs 21: 10; and Galatians 5: 17.
5: 20 ​ — “He who turns a sinner back from the error of his way ” will save whose soul from death?
1: 14, 15.
Sin has its beginning in improper desire.
Therefore, we should not nurture wrong desires by dwelling on them.
Rather, we need to “continue considering ” upbuilding things and filling our minds and hearts with them. ​ — Phil. 4: 8.
2: 8, 9.
“Showing favoritism ” is contrary to“ the kingly law ” of love.
Hence, true Christians do not show favoritism.
2: 14 - 26.
We are “saved through faith, ”“ not owing to works ” of the Mosaic Law or of those performed as Christians.
Our faith should be more than mere professed faith.
It should move us to godly action.
3: 13 - 17.
“The wisdom from above ” surely is superior to“ the earthly, animal, demonic ” wisdom!
We should ‘ keep searching for godly wisdom as for hid treasures. ’ ​ — Prov.
2: 1 - 5.
3: 18, footnotes.
The seed of the Kingdom good news is to be “sown with peace by those who are making peace. ”
It is important that we be peacemakers and not arrogant, quarrelsome, or riotous.
‘ STAND SOLID IN THE FAITH ’
(1 Pet.
1: 1 – 5: 14)
Peter reminds his fellow believers of their “living hope ” of an inheritance in heaven.
“You are ‘ a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, ’ ” Peter tells them.
After giving specific counsel on subjection, he exhorts all to be “like - minded, showing fellow feeling, having brotherly affection, tenderly compassionate, humble in mind. ” ​ — 1 Pet. 1: 3, 4; 2: 9; 3: 8.
Since “the end of [the Jewish system of] things has drawn close, ” Peter counsels the brothers to ‘ be sound in mind and vigilant with a view to prayers. ’
He tells them: “Keep your senses, be watchful....
Take your stand against [Satan], solid in the faith. ” ​ — 1 Pet. 4: 7; 5: 8, 9.
Scriptural Questions Answered:
3: 20 - 22 ​ — How does baptism save us?
Baptism is a requirement for those seeking salvation.
However, baptism itself does not save us.
Salvation is actually “through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. ”
The baptismal candidate must have faith that salvation is possible only because Jesus died a sacrificial death, was resurrected, and “is at God’s right hand, ” having authority over the living and the dead.
Baptism founded on such faith is what corresponds to ‘ eight souls being safely carried through the water. ’
4: 6 ​ — Who were “the dead ” to whom“ the good news was declared ”?
These were ones who were ‘ dead in their trespasses and sins, ’ or who were spiritually dead, before they heard the good news.
After putting faith in the good news, though, they began to “live ” spiritually.
1: 7.
For our faith to have excelling value, it must be of proved, or tested, quality.
Such strong faith does indeed ‘ preserve alive the soul. ’
We must not shrink back from tests of our faith.
1: 10 - 12.
Angels desired to peer into and understand the deep spiritual truths that God’s prophets of old times wrote concerning the anointed Christian congregation.
However, these things became clear only when Jehovah began dealing with the congregation.
Should we not follow the example of the angels and strive to search into “the deep things of God ”? ​ — 1 Cor. 2: 10.
2: 21.
In imitation of our Exemplar, Jesus Christ, we should be willing to suffer even to the point of death in order to uphold Jehovah’s sovereignty.
5: 6, 7.
When we throw our anxiety upon Jehovah, he helps us to keep giving true worship priority in our life instead of being unduly concerned about what the next day may bring. ​ — Matt.
6: 33, 34. “JEHOVAH’S DAY WILL COME ”
(2 Pet.
1: 1 – 3: 18)
“Prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, ” writes Peter,“ but men spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit. ”
Paying attention to the prophetic word can protect us from “false teachers ” and other corrupting individuals. ​ — 2 Pet. 1: 21; 2: 1 - 3.
“In the last days there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, ” warns Peter. But“ Jehovah’s day will come as a thief. ”
Peter closes his letter with sound advice to those ‘ awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of that day. ’ ​ — 2 Pet. 3: 3, 10 - 12. Scriptural Questions Answered:
The transfiguration provided a visionary foreview of Jesus ’ glory and Kingdom power, underscoring the dependability of God’s prophetic word.
Paying attention to that word illuminates our hearts, and we are thus made aware that the Daystar has risen.
2: 4 ​ — What is “Tartarus, ” and when were the rebellious angels thrown into it?
Tartarus is a prisonlike condition to which only spirit creatures ​ — not humans — ​ are consigned.
It is a state of dense mental darkness regarding God’s bright purposes.
Those in Tartarus have no hope for the future.
God threw the disobedient angels into Tartarus in Noah’s day, and they will remain in that abased condition until they are destroyed.
3: 17 ​ — What did Peter mean by “advance knowledge ”?
Peter was referring to advance knowledge, or foreknowledge, of future events, given to him and other Bible writers by inspiration.
Since this was not an infinite knowledge, having it did not result in the early Christians ’ knowing all the details about future events.
They came to know only the general outline of what could be expected.
1: 2, 5 - 7.
In addition to helping us increase in “accurate knowledge of God and of Jesus, ” our putting forth earnest effort to cultivate such qualities as faith, endurance, and godly devotion can“ cause [us] to be neither inactive nor unfruitful ” regarding that knowledge. ​ — 2 Pet. 1: 8, ftn.
1: 12 - 15.
To remain “firmly set in the truth, ” we need constant reminders, such as those we receive through our congregation meetings, personal study, and Bible reading.
2: 2.
We should be careful that our conduct does not bring reproach on Jehovah and his organization. ​ — Rom. 2: 24.
2: 4 - 9.
In view of what he has done in the past, we can be certain that “Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial, but to reserve unrighteous people for the day of judgment to be cut off. ”
2: 10 - 13.
While “glorious ones, ” that is, Christian elders, have faults and may err at times, we must not speak abusively of them. ​ — Heb. 13: 7, 17.
3: 2 - 4, 12.
Paying close attention to “the sayings previously spoken by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior ” will help us to keep in focus the nearness of Jehovah’s day.
3: 11 - 14.
As those “awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah, ” we must (1) ‘ be holy in conduct, ’ maintaining physical, mental, moral, and spiritual cleanness; (2) abound with deeds that reflect“ godly devotion, ” such as those in connection with the Kingdom - preaching and disciple - making work; (3) keep our conduct and personality “spotless, ” untainted by the world; (4) be“ unblemished, ” doing all things with a pure motive; and (5) be “in peace ” ​ — at peace with God, with our Christian brothers, and with fellow humans.
Jesus ​ — The Perfect Model to Follow
DO YOU want to be a better, happier person?
The apostle Peter explains how we can do so. He writes: “Christ suffered for you, leaving you a model for you to follow his steps closely. ”
Indeed, having lived an extraordinary life, Jesus Christ had much to offer.
By learning about Jesus and modeling our life after his, we can surely become better and happier people.
Let us take a closer look at some of the qualities that characterized this great man and see how we can benefit from his example.
Jesus was balanced.
Though Jesus said he had “nowhere to lay down his head, ” he did not practice or advocate an austere lifestyle.
He attended banquets.
His first recorded miracle ​ — changing water into fine wine at a wedding feast — ​ shows that he was not antisocial or an ascetic.
Yet, Jesus made clear what was most important to him. He said: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work. ” ​ — John 4: 34.
□ Have you analyzed your life to see how you can balance your material and spiritual pursuits?
Jesus was approachable.
The Bible portrays Jesus as a man who was warm and affable.
He was not annoyed when people approached him with problems or perplexing questions.
On one occasion when a crowd surrounded him, a woman who had been suffering from an affliction for 12 years touched his garment, hoping to get relief.
He did not rebuff her for her seemingly presumptuous act but kindly said: “Daughter, your faith has made you well. ”
Children too were comfortable in his company, without fear of being ignored.
His dealings with his disciples were marked by open, friendly conversations.
They did not hesitate to draw close to him. ​ — Mark 6: 30 - 32.
□ How freely do others approach you?
He was empathetic and compassionate.
One of Jesus ’ greatest virtues was his ability to put himself in the place of others, to share their feelings, and to respond with helpful action.
The apostle John relates that when Jesus saw Mary weeping over the death of her brother, Lazarus, Jesus “groaned in the spirit and became troubled ” and“ gave way to tears. ”
Onlookers could easily perceive the great affection Jesus felt for that family, an affection that he was not ashamed to manifest openly.
And what compassion he showed when he then brought his friend back to life! ​ — John 11: 33 - 44.
On another occasion, a man suffering from leprosy ​ — a dreadful disease that made him live in isolation — ​ begged Jesus: “Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean. ”
Be made clean. ’ ”
Jesus did not cure people simply to fulfill prophecy.
He wanted to wipe away their tears.
Everything he did was governed by one of his most often remembered sayings: “Just as you want men to do to you, do the same way to them. ” ​ — Luke 6: 31.
□ Can your compassion for others be seen in your deeds?
Jesus was understanding and discerning.
Although he was a man who committed no error, Jesus never expected perfection of others or assumed an air of superiority; nor did he act with a lack of understanding.
Jesus allowed her to do so, to the surprise of his host, who judged her harshly.
Understanding her sincerity, Jesus did not condemn the woman for her sins.
Rather, he said: “Your faith has saved you; go your way in peace. ”
As a result of Jesus ’ warm response, that woman was very likely moved to abandon her former way of life. ​ — Luke 7: 37 - 50.
□ Are you known for being quick to commend and slow to condemn?
He was impartial and respectful.
Perhaps because of a certain affinity of personalities and a possible family connection, Jesus had special affection for his disciple John.
* Nevertheless, he did not show any partiality toward him, or favor him over the other disciples.
In fact, when John and his sibling James asked for privileged positions in God’s Kingdom, Jesus answered: “This sitting down at my right or at my left is not mine to give. ” ​ — Mark 10: 35 - 40.
Jesus was always respectful to others.
He did not share in the prejudices of the people in his day.
For example, women were commonly treated as inferior to men.
Yet, Jesus accorded women due dignity.
The first time that he openly declared himself to be the Messiah, it was to a woman who was not a Jew but a Samaritan, whom the Jews in general would disdain, much less greet.
And it was to women that Jesus granted the privilege of being the first witnesses of his resurrection. ​ — Matthew 28: 9, 10.
□ Are you fair - minded in your dealings with people of a different race, gender, language, or nationality?
He was a dutiful son and brother.
Apparently, Jesus ’ adoptive father, Joseph, died when Jesus was still a youth.
Most likely, Jesus supported his mother and his younger brothers and sisters by working as a carpenter.
During his last moments of life, he entrusted his mother to the care of his disciple John. ​ — John 19: 26, 27.
□ Can you imitate Jesus by your assuming family responsibilities as he did?
Jesus was a true friend.
As a friend, Jesus was outstanding. How so?
He did not reject his friends just because they made mistakes, even the same mistakes repeatedly.
His disciples did not always act as he would have liked.
But he proved himself their friend by concentrating on their good qualities rather than imputing bad motives to them.
While not imposing his viewpoints on them, he invited them to express themselves freely. ​ — Matthew 16: 13 - 15.
Above all, Jesus loved his friends. To what extent?
He said: “No one has love greater than this, that someone should surrender his soul in behalf of his friends. ”
Could anyone offer his friends something more valuable than his own life?
□ Do you remain a friend even when others irritate or offend you?
He was courageous and manly.
Jesus was far different from the weak, passive person portrayed by some artists.
The Gospels present him as a strong, vigorous man.
Twice, Jesus drove merchants, with their goods, from the temple.
When a mob came to arrest “Jesus the Nazarene, ” he courageously stepped forward to identify himself and to protect his disciples, declaring firmly:“ I am he.
If, therefore, it is I you are looking for, let these go. ”
It is no wonder that when Pontius Pilate saw Jesus ’ courage under arrest and mistreatment, he declared: “Look!
The man! ” ​ — John 19: 4, 5.
□ Do you act decisively and courageously when you see what you must do?
These and other outstanding qualities make Jesus the perfect model for us.
If we allow ourselves to be influenced by his conduct, we will be better and happier people.
It is for this reason that the apostle Peter urged Christians to follow Jesus ’ steps closely.
Do you try to follow Jesus ’ steps as closely as possible?
More Than a Model to Follow
Jesus, however, was much more than just a model to follow.
He said: “I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me. ”
Besides making known the truth about God, thus opening up the way to draw close to Him, Jesus provided the means for faithful ones to gain life. ​ — John 3: 16.
Regarding this aspect of his reason for coming to earth, Jesus said: “The Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many. ”
By offering up his life as a sacrifice, Jesus laid the foundation for humans to enjoy eternal life.
What must we do individually to benefit from that provision?
Jesus explained: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ. ” ​ — John 17: 3.
Yes, taking in knowledge of Jesus, imitating his way of life, and exercising faith in his sacrificial death are requirements for gaining everlasting life.
We invite you to take the time to study the source of such knowledge, the Bible, and to strive to practice what it says, as Jesus did.
Jesus ’ exemplary life teaches us what kind of person we should be.
His sacrificial death can free us from sin and its wages, death.
How sad our situation would be without the powerful influence of Jesus Christ!
Never allow the preoccupations and anxieties of life to rob you of the opportunity to consider and follow closely the example of the greatest man who ever lived ​ — Jesus Christ.
John’s mother, Salome, was possibly the natural sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus.
Compare Matthew 27: 55, 56 with Mark 15: 40 and John 19: 25.
For a detailed account of Jesus ’ life on earth, see the book The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.

Cleanliness ​ — Why Is It Important?
For thousands of years, plagues and pestilences have afflicted mankind.
Some people assumed that these were a sign of the wrath of God and were sent to punish wrongdoers.
Patient observation and painstaking research over many centuries have revealed that the culprits were often small creatures that live alongside us.
Medical researchers discovered that rats, mice, cockroaches, flies, and mosquitoes can all serve as hosts for transmitting disease.
They also found that people often invite infectious diseases simply by a lack of hygiene.
Cleanliness, it seems, can make the difference between life and death.
Obviously, standards of cleanliness vary according to customs and circumstances.
In areas where there is no running water or adequate sewage disposal, hygiene can be a real challenge.
Nevertheless, God gave the ancient Israelites instructions on cleanliness while they were traveling through the wilderness ​ — some of the most difficult circumstances imaginable for practicing good hygiene!
Why does cleanliness matter to God?
What is a reasonable view of cleanliness?
What simple precautions can you and your family take to reduce disease?
SCHOOL is over, and little Max, * who lives in Cameroon, arrives back home.
Hungry and thirsty, he enters the humble home where he lives, gives his waiting dog a hug, puts his schoolbag on the dining - room table, sits down, and eagerly waits for his food.
Mother, who is in the kitchen, hears Max come in and brings a plate of hot rice and beans for him.
But her expression changes when she sees his schoolbag on the clean table.
She looks at her son and slowly utters one single word, “Maaaax! ”
Her son understands, quickly takes the bag away, and rushes out to wash his hands.
Soon he returns for his long - awaited meal.
“Sorry, Mum. I forgot, ” he mumbles guiltily.
A caring mother can do a lot when it comes to health and cleanliness, although she needs the cooperation of all members of her household.
As the account about Max illustrates, long - term training is necessary because cleanliness requires tireless effort and children need constant reminders.
Max’s mother realizes that food can get contaminated in various ways.
So she not only washes her own hands carefully before handling food but also keeps food covered to prevent contamination by flies.
By making sure that food does not sit unprotected and by keeping the house neat and clean, she has few problems with rats, mice, and cockroaches.
One important reason Max’s mother takes such care is that she wants to please God.
“The Bible says that God’s people must be holy because God is holy, ” she explains.
“Holiness is similar to cleanliness, ” she adds.
“So I want my home to be clean, and I want my family to look clean.
Of course, this is possible only because everyone in the family helps. ”
Family Cooperation Essential
As Max’s mother observes, family hygiene is a family project.
From time to time, some families sit down together to discuss what their needs are and what improvements can be made, both inside and outside the home.
This also serves to unite the family and to remind each one of his or her share in caring for the welfare of all.
For example, Mother may explain to the older children why they must wash their hands after using the toilet and handling things like money and before eating.
They, in turn, can make sure that the younger ones take the matter seriously. Different chores could be divided among all in the family.
The family may decide to clean the house regularly each week and to schedule a thorough cleaning once or twice a year.
And how about outside the house? Conservationist Stewart L.
Udall, referring to the United States, said: “We live in a land of vanishing beauty, of increasing ugliness, of shrinking open space, and of an overall environment that is diminished daily by pollution and noise and blight. ”
Do you have the same impression of your surroundings? In the old days and in some towns in Central Africa even today, a town crier rings a bell in order to get people’s attention.
In a loud voice, he reminds the citizens to clean up the town, empty the sewer (drainage or gutters), trim the trees, pull out the weeds, and take care of the garbage.
The disposal of garbage is a worldwide problem and a nightmare for many authorities.
Some municipalities fall behind in collecting garbage, which then piles up in the streets.
Local citizens may be invited to help.
As good citizens, Christians are among the first to respond and comply with Caesar’s laws without complaining.
True Christians are willing to go the extra mile to make a contribution in this regard.
They are interested in a clean environment and take the initiative in cleaning up, not always needing a town crier to remind them.
They understand that cleanliness is a reflection of good training and responsible behavior.
It starts with each individual and each family.
Simple application of sanitation and cleanliness around the house will lead to better health as well as improve the overall appearance of the neighborhood.
Personal Cleanliness Honors the God Whom We Worship
Clean and dignified personal appearance is a reflection of our worship and often attracts attention.
A group of about 15 young men and women entered a restaurant after attending a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Toulouse, France.
An elderly couple at the table next to them expected the worst ​ — noisy talking and heckling.
However, they were impressed by the orderly conduct and pleasant conversation of these nicely dressed young people.
When the group was ready to leave, the couple commended them for their fine behavior and told one of the young men that such exemplary conduct is rare these days.
Visitors to the branch offices, printeries, and residence facilities of Jehovah’s Witnesses are often impressed by the cleanliness they see there.
Clean clothes and regular washing and showering are requirements for the volunteers who work and live at these places.
Deodorants and perfumes cannot take the place of good bodily hygiene.
When these volunteers, who are full - time ministers, preach to their neighbors in the evenings or on weekends, their clean appearance also reflects favorably on the message they bear.
“Become Imitators of God ”
Christians are urged to “become imitators of God. ”
The prophet Isaiah recorded a vision in which angels described the Creator with the words “Holy, holy, holy. ”
This description emphasizes God’s superlative purity and cleanness.
That being the case, God requires that all his servants be holy, clean.
“You must be holy, because I am holy, ” he tells them. ​ — 1 Peter 1: 16.
The Bible encourages Christians to “dress in becoming manner. ”
Not surprisingly, in the book of Revelation, “bright, clean, fine linen ” is said to represent the righteous acts of ones whom God considers holy.
On the other hand, sin is often illustrated in the Scriptures by a stain or by dirt. ​ — Proverbs 15: 26; Isaiah 1: 16; James 1: 27.
Today, millions of people have to live in areas where it is a constant struggle to keep physically, morally, and spiritually clean.
The final solution to this problem will come when God ‘ makes all things new. ’
When that promise is fulfilled, filth and uncleanliness of all sorts will disappear forever.
Name has been changed.

God Requires Cleanliness
During their wilderness trek, the Israelites were instructed to take great care when disposing of human waste.
This must have been a tiresome chore in view of the size of the camp, but it doubtless helped prevent such diseases as typhoid fever and cholera.
The people were commanded to wash or destroy any item that came in contact with a dead body.
Though they might not have understood the reason for this, the Israelites were thus helped to avoid infection and disease. ​ — Leviticus 11: 32 - 38.
The priests were to wash both their hands and their feet before performing their duties at the tabernacle.
Filling the copper basin that contained the water for this purpose could not have been easy, but washing was a strict requirement. ​ — Exodus 30: 17 - 21.
[Box on page 11]
Reminders From a Medical Doctor
Water is essential to life, but contaminated water can be the source of sickness and death. Dr.
J. Mbangue Lobe, chief of the medical department at the port of Douala, Cameroon, offered some practical pointers in an interview.
“Boil your drinking water when in doubt. ”
But he warned: “The use of bleach or other chemicals are all right but may be hazardous if not handled properly.
Always wash your hands with soap and water before a meal and after using the toilet. A bar of soap does not cost a fortune, so even poor people can afford it.
Wash your clothes often, using hot water if you have skin problems or diseases. ”
“Good hygiene in and around the house must be observed by all members of the family, ” continued the doctor.
“Toilets and outhouses are often neglected and automatically become a haven for roaches and flies. ”
Adding one important observation concerning children, he cautioned: “Beware of bathing in those small creeks in your neighborhood.
They are full of dangerous microbes. Wash nightly at home before going to bed, brush your teeth well at night, and sleep under a mosquito net. ”
The general idea behind all these remarks is to think ahead, take action, and avoid trouble.

A Creator Worthy of Our Praise
Revelation 4: 11
HAVE you ever wondered, ‘ What is the meaning of life? ’
Those who believe that life is the result of mindless evolution grope in vain for the answer.
Not so those who accept the well - established truth that Jehovah God is the Source of life. They know that he had a purpose in creating us.
That purpose is stated at Revelation 4: 11.
Let us see how those words, penned by the apostle John, explain why we are here.
John presents a heavenly chorus extolling God: “You are worthy, Jehovah, even our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they existed and were created. ”
Jehovah alone is worthy, or deserving, of such homage.
Why? Because he “created all things. ”
Jehovah is said to be worthy to “receive ” glory, honor, and power.
Without question, he is the most glorious, honorable, and powerful Personage in the universe.
The majority of humankind, however, do not really recognize his Creatorship. Even so, there are those who clearly see God’s “invisible qualities ” through the things he has made.
With appreciative hearts, they are moved to give Jehovah glory and honor.
They proclaim to all who will hear the impressive evidence that Jehovah is the one who made all things wonderfully and that he is therefore deserving of our reverential respect. ​ — Psalm 19: 1, 2; 139: 14.
How, though, does Jehovah receive power from his worshippers?
Of course, no creature can confer power on the almighty Creator.
Yet, being created in God’s image, we are endowed with a measure of God’s attributes, one of which is power.
If we truly appreciate what our Creator has done for us, we will be moved to use our power and energy to honor and glorify him.
Instead of expending our energy solely on advancing our own interests, we feel that Jehovah God is worthy of receiving all our power as we serve him. ​ — Mark 12: 30.
Why, then, are we here?
The last part of Revelation 4: 11 answers: “Because of your will they [all created things] existed and were created. ”
We did not will ourselves into existence.
We exist because of God’s will.
For this reason, life lived solely for self - interest is empty and meaningless.
To find inner peace, joy, satisfaction, and fulfillment, we need to learn what God’s will is and then bring our life into harmony with it.
Only then will we find the purpose of our creation and existence. ​ — Psalm 40: 8.

Why Keep Your Integrity?
“Judge me, O Jehovah,... according to my integrity. ” ​ — PS.
7: 8.
1, 2.
What are some common situations that present challenges to a Christian’s integrity?
PICTURE three scenarios: A boy is facing some of his schoolmates.
They are trying to provoke him into losing his temper, perhaps to curse or to fight.
Will he retaliate, or will he restrain himself and walk away?
A husband at home alone is doing some research on the Internet.
A box appears on his computer screen, advertising a lewd Web site.
Will he be tempted and go to that site, or will he make sure that he avoids it?
A Christian woman is conversing with a small group when the talk turns negative, becoming hurtful gossip about a sister in the congregation.
Will she share in that, or will she try to change the subject?
Varied though those situations are, they have something in common.
They all involve the struggle to keep integrity as a Christian.
Do you have your own integrity in mind as you face your concerns, needs, and goals in life?
On a day - to - day basis, people think about their appearance, their health, the challenges of making a living, the ups and downs of their friendships, perhaps even romance.
We may give such concerns considerable attention.
What, though, particularly matters to Jehovah as he searches through our heart?
It is our integrity.
Jehovah bestows what privilege on us, and what will we consider in this article?
Jehovah, the Giver of “every good gift and every perfect present, ” has bestowed on each of us a variety of gifts.
Thanks to him, we have such gifts as a body, a mind, a measure of health, and various abilities.
However, Jehovah does not simply force us to display integrity.
He lets us choose for ourselves whether we will develop this quality.
We need, then, to examine what integrity is.
What Is Integrity?
What does integrity involve, and what may we learn from Jehovah’s law regarding animal sacrifices?
Many people seem to have a hazy idea of what integrity is.
For example, when politicians boast of their integrity, they often seem to mean honesty.
That quality is important, but it is only a part of integrity.
As used in the Bible, integrity involves moral completeness, soundness.
The Hebrew words relating to “integrity ” come from a root meaning sound, whole, or faultless.
One of these words is used regarding the sacrifices to be offered to Jehovah. An animal for sacrifice gained his approval only if it was sound, or whole.
(Read Leviticus 22: 19, 20.)
Jehovah strongly censured those who flouted his direction by offering lame, sick, or blind animals for sacrifice. ​ — Mal.
1: 6 - 8.
5, 6. (a) What examples show that we often value that which is whole, or complete?
(b) When it comes to imperfect humans, does integrity mean perfection?
Explain. The idea of seeking and valuing that which is whole, or complete, is not strange.
Imagine, for instance, a book collector who finds a precious volume after a long search, only to discover that it is missing several vital pages.
Disappointed, he may put it back on the shelf.
Or picture a woman walking on a beach, collecting some of the shells cast ashore by the waves.
Fascinated by the variety and beauty of these creations, she now and again stoops to examine one. Which ones does she keep?
Similarly, God is seeking people who have this quality of wholeness, or completeness. ​ — 2 Chron.
16: 9.
You may wonder, though, whether integrity demands perfection.
Because we are damaged by sin and imperfection, we may tend to think of ourselves as being a bit like an incomplete volume or a damaged shell.
Is that how you feel at times?
Rest assured that Jehovah does not expect us to be perfect in the absolute sense.
He never expects more of us than we can do.
* Still, he does expect us to keep integrity.
Is there a difference, then, between perfection and integrity? Yes.
To illustrate: A young man loves a young woman whom he is going to marry.
He would be foolish to expect her to be perfect.
Yet, he would be wise to expect her to be wholehearted in her love for him, that is, to have romantic love for him alone.
In a comparable way, Jehovah is “a God exacting exclusive devotion. ”
He expects us, not to be perfect, but to love him wholeheartedly, giving worship to him alone.
7, 8. (a) Jesus set what example regarding integrity?
(b) What is the essence of integrity in the Scriptural sense?
We might be reminded of Jesus ’ answer when he was asked what was the most important of all laws. (Read Mark 12: 28 - 30.)
Not only did Jesus give the answer; he lived it.
He set the ultimate example in loving Jehovah with his whole mind, heart, soul, and strength.
He showed that integrity is expressed, not in mere words, but in positive actions that spring from pure motives.
Our keeping integrity calls on us to follow in Jesus ’ footsteps. ​ — 1 Pet. 2: 21.
Here, then, is the essence of our integrity in the Scriptural sense: wholehearted devotion to one heavenly Person, Jehovah God, and to his expressed will and purpose.
Keeping integrity means that in our day - to - day life, we will seek above all to please Jehovah God.
Our priorities in life will reflect his priorities.
Let us consider three reasons why this is so important. Our Integrity and the Issue of Sovereignty
How does our personal integrity relate to the issue of universal sovereignty?
Jehovah’s sovereignty does not depend on our integrity.
His sovereignty is just, eternal, and universal.
It will always be so, regardless of what any creatures say or do.
However, God’s sovereignty has been grossly maligned in the heavens and on the earth.
His rulership thus needs to be vindicated ​ — confirmed as right, just, and loving — ​ before all intelligent creatures.
As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we love to discuss God’s universal sovereignty with anyone who will listen.
How, though, can we take our own stand on the issue?
How do we show that we choose Jehovah as our own Sovereign?
What charge has Satan made regarding the integrity of humans, and how would you like to respond?
Consider how your integrity is involved.
Satan has in essence claimed that no human will stand up for God’s sovereignty, that no one will serve Jehovah out of unselfish love.
In front of a vast assemblage of spirit creatures, the Devil said to Jehovah: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. ”
Notice that Satan did not limit that slur to the righteous man Job but stated it as a general rule regarding mankind.
The Bible accordingly calls Satan “the accuser of our brothers. ”
He taunts Jehovah with the claim that Christians ​ — including you — ​ will not remain faithful.
Satan claims that you would betray Jehovah in order to save your own skin.
How do you feel about such charges being heaped upon you?
Would you not welcome an opportunity to prove Satan a liar?
By keeping your integrity, you can do just that.
11, 12. (a) What examples illustrate how our decisions in day - to - day matters relate to the issue of personal integrity?
(b) Why is keeping integrity a privilege?
The issue of your integrity thus makes day - to - day conduct and choices quite important.
Consider again the three scenarios we mentioned earlier.
What would be the course of integrity?
The boy being taunted by his schoolmates is sorely tempted to lash out at them, but he remembers this admonition: “Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath; for it is written: ‘ Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says Jehovah. ’ ” He walks away.
The husband who is using the Internet could look at sexually arousing material, but he recalls the principle reflected in Job’s words: “A covenant I have concluded with my eyes.
So how could I show myself attentive to a virgin? ”
Similarly, the man refuses to let his eyes rest on unsavory images, avoiding such material as if it were poison.
The woman conversing in a group where she might hear a bit of hurtful gossip holds back, recalling the direction: “Let each of us please his neighbor in what is good for his upbuilding. ”
The gossip she could repeat is not upbuilding. It would not reflect well on her Christian sister; nor would it please her Father.
So she controls her tongue and changes the subject.
In each of those cases, the Christian makes a choice that, in effect, says: ‘ Jehovah is my Ruler. I will try to do what pleases him in this matter. ’
Do you view your personal choices and decisions in that light?
If you do, you can truly live up to the heartwarming words recorded at Proverbs 27: 11: “Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, that I may make a reply to him that is taunting me. ”
What a privilege we have in making God’s heart rejoice!
Is it not well worth our every effort to keep our integrity?
The Basis for Divine Judgment
How do the words of Job and David show that integrity is the basis on which Jehovah judges us?
We see that integrity enables us to take our stand for Jehovah’s sovereignty.
It is thus the basis on which God can judge us.
Job well understood this truth. (Read Job 31: 6.)
Job knew that God weighs all mankind in “accurate scales, ” using His perfect standard of justice to gauge our integrity.
David similarly said: “Jehovah himself will pass sentence on the peoples.
Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness and according to my integrity in me....
And God as righteous is testing out heart and kidneys. ”
We know that God can look into the very depths of the inner person, the figurative “heart and kidneys. ” We need to remember, though, what he is looking for.
As David said, Jehovah judges us according to our integrity.
Imagine Jehovah God searching the billions of hearts of mankind today.
How often does he find someone keeping Christian integrity?
It is relatively rare indeed! However, we should not assume that we are too flawed to maintain integrity.
On the contrary, we have good reason to trust, as did David and Job, that Jehovah will find us maintaining integrity, imperfect though we may be.
Remember, perfection does not guarantee our keeping integrity.
Only three perfect humans have walked this earth, and two, Adam and Eve, failed to keep integrity.
Still, many millions of imperfect humans have succeeded in doing so.
You can too. Essential to Our Hope
How did David show that integrity is essential to our hope for the future?
Because integrity is at the core of Jehovah’s judgment of us, it is essential to our hope for the future.
David knew this to be true. (Read Psalm 41: 12.)
He cherished the hope of receiving God’s favorable attention forever.
Like true Christians today, David hoped to live forever, continuing to draw ever closer to Jehovah God while serving him.
David saw the role that his maintaining integrity would play if he was to see the fulfillment of that hope.
Similarly, Jehovah upholds us, teaches us, guides us, and blesses us as we keep our integrity.
16, 17. (a) Why are you resolved always to hold fast to your integrity?
(b) What questions will the next article discuss?
Hope is essential to our present happiness.
It can give us the joy we need to get through difficult times. Hope can protect our thinking too.
Remember, the Bible likens hope to a helmet.
As a helmet protects a soldier’s head in battle, hope protects our mind from the negative, pessimistic thinking Satan promotes in this dying old world.
Life is poor, indeed, when we are bereft of hope.
We need to examine ourselves honestly, carefully considering the state of our own integrity and the hope linked to it.
Do not forget that by keeping integrity, you are upholding Jehovah’s sovereignty and safeguarding your precious hope for the future.
May you always hold fast to your integrity!
Since integrity is so important, we need to consider some further questions.
How do we build integrity?
How can we maintain it? And what could be done if someone for a time did not keep it?
Jesus did say: “You must accordingly be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. ”
He evidently understood that even imperfect humans can be complete, or perfect, in a relative sense.
We can fulfill the command to love others generously, thereby pleasing God.
Jehovah, however, is perfect in the absolute sense.
When applied to him, the term “integrity ” also involves perfection. ​ — Ps.
18: 30.
How Would You Answer?
• What is integrity?
• How does integrity relate to the issue of universal sovereignty?
• How does integrity provide a basis for our hope?
[Pictures on page 5]
Everyday life presents many challenges to our integrity
Will You Hold Fast to Your Integrity?
“Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself! ” ​ — JOB 27: 5.
1, 2.
We need to engage in what building project, and what questions will we consider?
IMAGINE that you are looking over the plans for a house.
You marvel at the practicality of the design.
You delight in thinking of the ways in which the house could benefit you and your family.
Would you not agree, though, that those plans and any thought you might give them would do little good unless you actually built the house, moved in, and then maintained it?
Similarly, integrity may impress us as a vital quality that will do us and those we love a great deal of good.
But thinking approvingly about integrity benefits us little unless we build and maintain our Christian integrity.
In today’s world, literal building projects often prove costly.
Likewise, building integrity costs time and effort, yet it is well worth it.
So let us discuss three questions: How can we be people of integrity?
How can we maintain our Christian integrity?
What can be done if someone for a time did not keep his integrity?
How Can We Be People of Integrity?
3, 4. (a) In what ways does Jehovah help us build integrity?
(b) How can we build integrity, as exemplified by Jesus?
We noted in the preceding article that Jehovah dignifies us with the privilege of deciding whether we will be people of integrity.
Happily, though, he does not simply leave us on our own in the matter.
He teaches us how to build this precious quality, and he gives us generously of his holy spirit, which helps us apply his teachings.
He even provides spiritual protection for those who endeavor to walk in integrity. ​ — Prov.
2: 7.
How has Jehovah taught us to be integrity keepers?
Above all, by sending his Son, Jesus, to the earth.
Jesus lived a course of perfect obedience.
He “became obedient as far as death. ” In everything that he did, Jesus obeyed his heavenly Father, even when it was extremely difficult.
“Let, not my will, but yours take place, ” he said to Jehovah.
Each of us does well to ask himself, ‘ Do I have a similarly obedient spirit? ’
By pursuing a course of obedience with the right motive, we will be integrity keepers.
Consider some areas of life in which obedience is especially important.
5, 6. (a) How did David stress the importance of keeping integrity even when we are not seen by other humans?
(b) Christians today face what challenges to integrity when alone?
The psalmist David noted the importance of integrity on occasions when he may have been alone.
(Read Psalm 101: 2.) As king, David led a very public life.
There were no doubt many times when he had hundreds, even thousands, of observers. (Compare Psalm 26: 12.)
Keeping integrity at such times was important, for the king needed to set a good example for his people.
However, David learned that when he might have been alone ​ — ‘ inside his house ’ — ​ he still needed to walk in integrity.
What about us?
At Psalm 101: 3, we find David’s words: “I shall not set in front of my eyes any good - for - nothing thing. ”
There are many opportunities today to set in front of our eyes good - for - nothing things, particularly when we are alone. Access to the Internet has presented many with a challenge in this regard.
It is easy to be lured into looking at suggestive, even pornographic, material.
But is doing so an act of obedience to the God who inspired David to pen those words?
Pornography is harmful, for it inflames wrong and greedy desires, damages the conscience, erodes marriages, and degrades everyone involved. ​ — Prov.
4: 23; 2 Cor.
7: 1; 1 Thess.
4: 3 - 5.
What principle can help us to keep integrity when we are alone?
Of course, no servant of Jehovah is ever truly alone.
Our Father lovingly watches over us. (Read Psalm 11: 4.)
How pleased Jehovah must be when he sees you resisting temptation! By your doing so, you heed the warning implicit in the words of Jesus found at Matthew 5: 28.
By all means, be determined not to look at images that would tempt you to do wrong.
Do not trade your precious integrity for the shameful act of looking at or reading pornography!
8, 9. (a) Daniel and his companions faced what challenge to their integrity?
(b) How do young Christians today delight Jehovah and their fellow Christians?
We can also be integrity keepers by obeying Jehovah when we are among unbelievers.
Think of Daniel and his three companions. As youths, they were taken as captives to Babylon.
There, surrounded by unbelievers who knew little or nothing of Jehovah, the four Hebrews were put under pressure to eat delicacies that God’s Law forbade.
Those boys might easily have rationalized a course of compromise.
After all, their parents, the elders, and the priests could not see what the four of them were doing.
Who would know?
Jehovah himself would.
So they took a firm stand and obeyed him despite the pressure and the risk. ​ — Dan.
1: 3 - 9.
Around the world, young Witnesses of Jehovah are following a similar course, holding to God’s standards for Christians and refusing to give in to harmful peer pressure.
When you young ones refuse to get involved in drugs, violence, cursing, immorality, and other wrongs, you are obeying Jehovah. As you do, you are keeping your integrity.
You benefit yourself, and you delight Jehovah and your fellow Christians! ​ — Ps.
110: 3.
(a) What wrong views of fornication have led some youths to compromise their integrity?
(b) How does integrity lead us to behave as respects the danger of fornication?
We also need to be obedient when dealing with members of the opposite sex.
We know that God’s Word forbids fornication.
However, it is easy to let an obedient spirit lapse into a permissive one.
For instance, some youths have engaged in oral or anal sex or mutual masturbation, rationalizing that these acts are not so bad because they think they are technically not “having sex. ”
Such youths forget ​ — or may choose to ignore — ​ that the Bible word for fornication includes all those practices, wrong conduct for which one might be disfellowshipped.
* Worse, though, they ignore the need for integrity.
Since we are striving to keep our integrity, we do not look for loopholes.
We do not try to get as close as we can to sin without being punished.
We do not focus solely on the judicial consequences that an act of wrongdoing might bring. Rather, we focus on doing what will please Jehovah, avoiding what will hurt his feelings.
Rather than seeing how close we can get to sin, we keep far away from it and “flee from fornication. ”
We thus show that we are people of genuine integrity.
How Can We Maintain Our Integrity?
Why is each act of obedience significant?
We build integrity by obedience, so we maintain integrity by enduring in an obedient course.
A single act of obedience may seem insignificant ​ — a minor matter.
Yet, such obedient acts add up over time.
To illustrate: A single brick may seem insignificant, but if we carefully place many of them together, we can build a fine home.
So by continuing to add to our acts of obedience, we maintain our integrity. ​ — Luke 16: 10.
How did David set an example of maintaining integrity in the face of mistreatment and injustice?
Our integrity is especially evident when we endure in the face of hardships, mistreatment, or injustice.
Consider the Biblical example of David.
As a young man, he endured persecution from a king who was supposed to represent Jehovah’s authority.
King Saul, however, had lost Jehovah’s favor and was bitterly jealous of David, whom God approved.
Yet, Saul remained in authority for a time and used Israel’s army to hound David.
Jehovah allowed this injustice to continue for some years.
Was David embittered against God? Did he decide that it was no use enduring?
He maintained the greatest respect for Saul’s position as God’s anointed, refusing to strike back at Saul when an opportunity presented itself. ​ — 1 Sam.
24: 2 - 7.
How can we maintain our integrity if we are hurt or offended?
How powerfully David’s example speaks to us today!
We are part of a worldwide congregation of imperfect humans, any one of whom may wrong us or even become unfaithful.
Of course, we are blessed to live at a time when Jehovah’s people as a whole can never be corrupted.
Still, how will we respond should an individual let us down or hurt our feelings?
If we were to let bitterness toward a fellow worshipper poison our heart, our integrity to God could be compromised.
The conduct of others never creates an excuse for our becoming bitter toward God or for abandoning a faithful course.
Enduring even in the face of trials will help us to maintain our integrity.
Integrity - keepers respond in what way to organizational changes and doctrinal refinements?
We can also maintain integrity by avoiding a fault - finding, critical spirit.
That means, of course, being loyal to Jehovah. He is blessing his people now more than ever.
Pure worship has never in all of history been so exalted on earth. When adjustments are made in explanation of Bible texts or in how things are done, we want to accept them.
We are delighted to see evidence that the spiritual light is still increasing.
If we find it hard to understand a change, we ask Jehovah to help us to comprehend the point.
Meanwhile, we endure in an obedient course, keeping our integrity.
What if Someone Does Not Keep Integrity?
Who only can take away your integrity?
That is a sobering question, is it not? As we learned in the preceding article, integrity is absolutely essential. Without it, we have no relationship with Jehovah and no real hope.
Keep this in mind: There is only one person in the universe who can take away your integrity.
That person is you. Job understood that truth well. He said: “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself! ”
If you have the same determination and if you stay close to Jehovah, you need never lose hold of your integrity. ​ — Jas. 4: 8.
16, 17. (a) If a person falls into serious sin, what is the wrong course to take?
(b) What is the right course to take?
Still, some fail to maintain their integrity.
Even as occurred when the apostles were still present, some fall into a practice of serious sin.
If that happened with you, is the situation hopeless?
Not necessarily.
What can be done?
Let us first consider what not to do.
The human tendency is to conceal a wrong from the view of parents, fellow Christians, or elders.
However, the Bible reminds us: “He that is covering over his transgressions will not succeed, but he that is confessing and leaving them will be shown mercy. ”
Those who seek to cover over sins make a tragic mistake, for there can be no concealing of anything from God.
(Read Hebrews 4: 13.)
Some even try to lead a double life, pretending to serve Jehovah while carrying on a course of sin.
Jehovah is not pleased with acts of worship carried out by individuals who are concealing serious sins.
On the contrary, such hypocrisy angers him. ​ — Prov.
21: 27; Isa.
1: 11 - 16.
When a Christian gets involved in serious wrongdoing, the right course is clear.
Jehovah has an arrangement in place for dealing with cases of serious spiritual sickness. (Read James 5: 14.)
Do not let fear of possible discipline or correction keep you from pursuing your spiritual health.
After all, would a wise person let the passing pain of an injection or even an operation keep him from addressing a life - threatening health problem? ​ — Heb.
12: 11. 18, 19. (a) How does David’s example show that integrity can be regained?
(b) What is your determination regarding your integrity?
Is there hope for full recovery? Can integrity be regained once it is lost?
Consider again the example of David.
He fell into serious sin. He looked covetously at another man’s wife, committed adultery, and arranged that the innocent mate be killed.
It is hard to think of David at that time as a man of integrity, is it not?
Yet, was his situation hopeless?
David needed and received strong discipline.
Then, his sincere repentance led Jehovah to extend mercy.
David learned from the discipline and regained his integrity by obeying God and enduring in that course.
David’s life exemplified what we read at Proverbs 24: 16: “The righteous one may fall even seven times, and he will certainly get up. ” The result?
Consider what Jehovah stated to Solomon about David after he died. (Read 1 Kings 9: 4.)
God remembered David as a man of integrity.
Jehovah can, indeed, cleanse repentant sinners from the stain of even serious sins. ​ — Isa.
1: 18.
Yes, you will be a person of integrity by showing loving obedience.
Maintain loyal endurance, and if serious sin occurs, manifest genuine repentance.
What a precious gem is integrity!
May each of us share the determination of David: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. ” ​ — Ps.
26: 11.
See The Watchtower of February 15, 2004, page 13, paragraph 15.

‘ IT WAS BEAUTIFUL ’
A woman who was five months pregnant spoke those words regarding the kindness and integrity of a stranger.
She had been in a coffee shop, and hours later she realized that she had left her wallet behind.
“I was crushed, ” she later told a local newspaper. However, a young woman found the wallet and immediately sought its rightful owner. Unsuccessful, she took it to the police station, and the police tracked down the pregnant woman.
“It was a really, really beautiful thing to do, ” the grateful owner commented.
Why did the young woman go to such lengths to return the money?
The newspaper noted that as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, she “credits her integrity to the religion with which she was raised. ”

Appreciate Jesus ’ Unique Role in God’s Purpose
“I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me. ” ​ — JOHN 14: 6.
1, 2.
Why should we be interested in examining Jesus ’ unique role in God’s purpose?
THROUGHOUT the ages, many have endeavored to stand out as different from those around them, but few do.
Even fewer individuals can rightly claim that they are unique in significant ways.
Yet, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is unique in many ways.
Why should Jesus ’ unique role interest us?
Because our very relationship with our heavenly Father, Jehovah, is involved!
Jesus said: “I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me. ”
Let us examine some of the ways in which Jesus is unique.
Doing so will build our appreciation for his role in God’s purpose.
“The Only - Begotten Son ”
3, 4. (a) Why can we say that Jesus is unique in his role as the only - begotten Son?
(b) How was Jesus ’ role in creation unique? Jesus is not just “a son of God. ”
That is how Satan referred to Jesus while tempting him. Jesus is rightly called “the only - begotten Son of God. ”
The Greek word translated “only - begotten ” has been defined as“ single of its kind, only, ” “the only member of a kin or kind, ” or“ unique. ”
In what sense, then, is Jesus the only one “of a kin or kind ”? Jesus is unique in that he is the sole direct creation of his Father. He is the firstborn Son.
He is “the beginning of the creation by God. ” The only - begotten Son’s role in creation is also unique.
He was not the Creator, or Originator, of creation.
But Jehovah used him as the agent, or means, to create all other things.
(Read John 1: 3.)
The apostle Paul wrote: “There is actually to us one God the Father, out of whom all things are, and we for him; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and we through him. ” ​ — 1 Cor. 8: 6.
How do the Scriptures highlight the uniqueness of Jesus?
However, much more is involved in the uniqueness of Jesus.
The Scriptures attribute to him many titles or designations that highlight his unique role in God’s purpose.
Let us now examine five more of these as applied to Jesus in the Christian Greek Scriptures. *
“The Word ”
Why is it appropriate that Jesus is called “the Word ”?
Read John 1: 14.
Why is Jesus called “the Word, ” or Logos?
This title identifies the function that he has performed since other intelligent creatures came into existence.
Jehovah used his Son to convey information and instructions to other spirit sons, even as God used that Son to deliver His message to humans on earth.
The fact that Jesus is the Word, or God’s Spokesman, is echoed in what Christ said to his Jewish listeners: “What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him that sent me.
Jesus continues to bear the title “The Word of God ” even after his return to heavenly glory. ​ — Rev. 19: 11, 13, 16.
How can we imitate the humility Jesus shows in his role as “the Word ”?
Just think about what this title implies. Although Jesus is the wisest of all of Jehovah’s creatures, he does not rely on his own wisdom.
He speaks as his Father instructs him. He always directs attention to Jehovah rather than to himself.
What a wonderful example for us to imitate!
We too have been entrusted with the precious privilege to “declare good news of good things. ”
Appreciation for Jesus ’ example of humility should move us to avoid speaking of our own initiative.
When it comes to conveying the lifesaving message in the Scriptures, we do not want to “go beyond the things that are written. ” ​ — 1 Cor. 4: 6.
“The Amen ”
8, 9. (a) What does the word “amen ” mean, and why is Jesus called“ the Amen ”?
(b) How did Jesus fulfill his role as “the Amen ”?
Read Revelation 3: 14.
Why is Jesus called “the Amen ”?
The word rendered “amen ” is a transliteration of a Hebrew word that means“ so be it, ” or “surely. ”
The Hebrew root word from which it is drawn means to “be faithful ” or“ trustworthy. ”
This same word is used to describe Jehovah’s faithfulness.
So in what way is Jesus unique when he is referred to as “the Amen ”?
Notice how 2 Corinthians 1: 19, 20 answers: “The Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you..., did not become Yes and yet No, but Yes has become Yes in his case.
For no matter how many the promises of God are, they have become Yes by means of him.
Therefore also through him is the ‘ Amen ’ said to God for glory. ”
Jesus is “the Amen ” to all the divine promises.
His flawless life course on earth, including his sacrificial death, confirmed and made possible the fulfillment of all the promises of Jehovah God.
By remaining faithful, Jesus also proved false Satan’s claim, recorded in the book of Job, that under privation, suffering, and test, God’s servants would deny Him.
Of all God’s creatures, the firstborn Son could give the most conclusive answer to that charge.
In addition, Jesus provided the finest evidence supporting his Father’s side in the greater issue of the rightfulness of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty.
How can we imitate Jesus in his unique role as “the Amen ”?
How can we imitate Jesus in his unique role as “the Amen ”?
By remaining faithful to Jehovah and supporting his universal sovereignty.
In so doing, we will be responding positively to the request recorded at Proverbs 27: 11: “Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, that I may make a reply to him that is taunting me. ”
“The Mediator of a New Covenant ”
11, 12.
How is Jesus ’ role as Mediator unique?
Read 1 Timothy 2: 5, 6.
Jesus is the “one mediator between God and men. ” He is“ the mediator of a new covenant. ”
However, Moses is also spoken of as a mediator ​ — the mediator of the Law covenant. How, then, is Jesus ’ role as Mediator unique?
The original - language word translated “mediator ” is a legal term.
It refers to Jesus as a legal Mediator (or, in a sense, an attorney) of the new covenant that made possible the birth of a new nation, “the Israel of God. ”
This nation is composed of spirit - anointed Christians, who form a heavenly “royal priesthood. ”
The Law covenant, with Moses as mediator, was not able to produce a nation like that.
What is involved in Jesus ’ role as Mediator?
What does Jesus ’ role as Mediator involve?
Well, Jehovah applies the value of Jesus ’ blood to those being brought into the new covenant. In this way, Jehovah legally credits them with righteousness.
God can then take them into the new covenant with the prospect of their becoming heavenly king - priests!
As their Mediator, Jesus assists them in maintaining a clean standing before God. ​ — Heb.
2: 16. Why should all Christians, whatever their hope, truly appreciate Jesus ’ role as Mediator?
What about those who are not in the new covenant, those who hope to live forever on earth, not in heaven?
While not participants in the new covenant, these are beneficiaries of it.
They receive forgiveness of their sins and are declared righteous as God’s friends.
Whether we have a heavenly hope or an earthly hope, each one of us has good reason to appreciate Jesus ’ role as the Mediator of the new covenant.
“High Priest ”
How is Jesus ’ role as High Priest different from that of all other men who have served as high priests?
Many men have served as high priests in the past, yet Jesus ’ role as High Priest is truly unique.
Paul explains: “He does not need daily, as those high priests do, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins and then for those of the people: (for this he did once for all time when he offered himself up;) for the Law appoints men high priests having weakness, but the word of the sworn oath that came after the Law appoints a Son, who is perfected forever. ” ​ — Heb. 7: 27, 28.
Why is Jesus ’ sacrifice truly unique?
Jesus was a perfect man, the exact equal of Adam before that one sinned.
As such, Jesus was the only human to be in a position to offer up a perfect, complete sacrifice ​ — the type of sacrifice without any need to be repeated.
Under the Mosaic Law, sacrifices were offered on a daily basis.
All such sacrifices and priestly services were a mere shadow, though, of what Jesus was to accomplish.
So in its effectiveness and permanence, Jesus ’ office as High Priest is unique.
Why should we appreciate Jesus ’ role as our High Priest, and how can we do so?
We need the services of Jesus as High Priest to help us have a right standing with God.
And what a wonderful High Priest we have!
“We have as high priest, not one who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, ” wrote Paul,“ but one who has been tested in all respects like ourselves, but without sin. ”
Truly, appreciation of this fact should move us to ‘ live no longer for ourselves, but for him who died for us. ’ ​ — 2 Cor.
5: 14, 15; Luke 9: 23.
The Foretold “Seed ”
What prophecy was uttered after Adam sinned, and what was later revealed concerning this prophecy?
Back in Eden, when it appeared that mankind had lost everything ​ — a clean standing with God, everlasting life, happiness, and Paradise — ​ Jehovah God foretold a Deliverer.
This one was referred to as the “seed. ”
This mystery Seed became a theme of numerous Bible prophecies down through the ages.
He was to be a descendant of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Also, he was to be in the line of King David. ​ — Gen.
21: 12; 22: 16 - 18; 28: 14; 2 Sam.
7: 12 - 16.
19, 20. (a) Who is the promised Seed?
(b) Why can it be said that the foretold seed includes more than Jesus?
Who was this promised Seed?
The answer to this question can be found at Galatians 3: 16.
However, later in the same chapter, the apostle Paul goes on to say to anointed Christians: “Moreover, if you belong to Christ, you are really Abraham’s seed, heirs with reference to a promise. ”
How is it that Christ is the promised Seed, and yet others too are included?
Millions claim to have descended from Abraham, some even acting as prophets.
Some religions place great importance on the claim that their prophets descended from Abraham.
But are all of these the promised Seed?
As the apostle Paul points out under inspiration, not all of Abraham’s descendants can claim to be the promised Seed.
The offspring of Abraham’s other sons were not used to bless humankind. The seed of blessing was to be through Isaac alone.
Ultimately, only one man, Jesus Christ, whose genealogy from Abraham is documented in the Bible, is the primary part of that foretold seed.
* All others who later become the secondary part of Abraham’s seed are such because they “belong to Christ. ”
Yes, Jesus ’ role in fulfilling this prophecy is truly unique.
What impresses you about the way Jesus has fulfilled his unique role in Jehovah’s purpose?
What have we learned from this brief review of Jesus ’ unique role in Jehovah’s purpose?
From the time of his creation onward, God’s only - begotten Son has truly been unique, one of a kind.
However, this unique Son of God who became Jesus has always humbly served in harmony with the will of his Father, never seeking glory for himself.
What an outstanding example for us today!
Like Jesus, may we make it our goal to “do all things for God’s glory. ” ​ — 1 Cor. 10: 31.
According to one Bible scholar, the word translated “once for all time ” expresses an important Biblical concept that“ suggests the definiteness, uniqueness, or singularity of the death of Christ. ”
Even though the Jews in the first century C.E. thought that they, as Abraham’s literal offspring, or descendants, would be the favored people, they looked for one person to come as the Messiah, or Christ. ​ — John 1: 25; 7: 41, 42; 8: 39 - 41.

Determined to Bear Thorough Witness
“He ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness. ” ​ — ACTS 10: 42.
When speaking before Cornelius, Peter highlighted what commission?
THE Italian army officer assembled his relatives and friends for what became a turning point in God’s dealings with humans.
That God - fearing man was Cornelius.
The apostle Peter told the group that the apostles were ordered “to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness ” about Jesus.
Peter’s witness bore abundant fruit.
Uncircumcised Gentiles received God’s spirit, were baptized, and came in line to be kings in heaven with Jesus.
What an outcome of Peter’s bearing thorough witness! ​ — Acts 10: 22, 34 - 48.
How do we know that the charge to bear witness was not limited to the 12 apostles?
That was in 36 C.E. About two years earlier, a fervent opposer of Christianity had a life - changing experience.
Saul of Tarsus was on his way to Damascus when Jesus appeared to him and said: “Enter into the city, and what you must do will be told you. ”
Jesus assured the disciple Ananias that Saul would bear witness “to the nations as well as to kings and the sons of Israel. ” (Read Acts 9: 3 - 6, 13 - 20.)
When with Saul, Ananias said: “The God of our forefathers has chosen you... because you are to be a witness for him to all men. ”
How seriously did Saul, later known as Paul, take the assignment to bear witness?
He Did Bear Thorough Witness!
(a) We will focus on what particular account?
(b) How did the Ephesian elders respond to Paul’s message, setting what good example?
It would be fascinating to study in detail all that Paul did thereafter, but for now, let us focus on a talk Paul gave in about 56 C.E., as set out in Acts chapter 20. Paul presented this discourse near the end of his third missionary trip.
Ephesus was some 30 miles [50 km] away, though the trip was longer over winding roads.
You can imagine how excited the Ephesian elders were when they received Paul’s message.
(Compare Proverbs 10: 28.)
Still, they would have to make arrangements to travel to Miletus.
Did some of them have to take time off from work or to close their shops?
Many Christians today do so to be sure that they will not miss even one session of their yearly district convention.
Paul had followed what course when he was in Ephesus for some years?
What do you think Paul did in Miletus during the three or four days until the elders arrived?
What would you have done?
(Compare Acts 17: 16, 17.)
Paul’s words to the Ephesian elders provide some insight.
He described his pattern of life over the years, including when he earlier was in Ephesus.
(Read Acts 20: 18 - 21.)
With no fear of contradiction, he said: “You well know how from the first day that I stepped into the district of Asia...
I thoroughly bore witness. ” Yes, he was determined to carry out his commission from Jesus. How did he do so in Ephesus? One way was by witnessing to Jews, going where many would be found.
Luke reports that when Paul was in Ephesus about 52 - 55 C.E., he ‘ gave talks and used persuasion ’ in the synagogue.
When the Jews “went on hardening themselves and not believing, ” Paul turned to others, relocating in the city but still preaching.
He thus bore witness to Jews and Greeks in that large city. ​ — Acts 19: 1, 8, 9.
5, 6.
Why can we be sure that Paul’s house - to - house preaching involved unbelievers?
Some who became Christians qualified in time to be elders, those to whom Paul spoke in Miletus.
Paul reminded them of the method he had used: “I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house. ”
In our time, some people have claimed that Paul was here referring merely to making shepherding calls on believers.
But, no. The description ‘ teaching publicly and from house to house ’ mainly applied to evangelizing among unbelievers.
That is plain from his next words. Paul said that he had been witnessing “both to Jews and to Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus. ”
Clearly, Paul had been bearing witness to unbelievers, who needed to repent and put faith in Jesus. ​ — Acts 20: 20, 21.
In an extensive analysis of the Christian Greek Scriptures, one scholar said of Acts 20: 20: “Paul had spent three years in Ephesus.
He visited every house, or at least he preached to all of the people.
Here is scriptural warrant for house to house evangelism as well as that carried on in public meetings. ”
Whether he literally visited every house, as this scholar claims, or not, Paul did not want the Ephesian elders to forget how he had borne witness and with what result.
Luke reported: “All those inhabiting the district of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks. ”
But how could “all ” in Asia have heard, and what might this suggest about our bearing witness?
How did Paul’s preaching likely have an effect beyond those to whom he witnessed directly?
By Paul’s preaching in public locations and from house to house, many heard his message.
Do you think it likely that all those who did hear stayed in Ephesus, none moving elsewhere to do business, to be near relatives, or to escape the hustle and bustle of big - city life? Hardly. Many today have moved for such reasons; possibly you have.
Also, back then, people from other parts visited Ephesus for social or commercial reasons.
While there, they may have met Paul or heard him witness.
What would happen when they returned home?
Those who had accepted the truth would bear witness. Others might not have become believers, yet they likely talked of what they had heard while in Ephesus.
Hence, relatives, neighbors, or clients heard the truth, and some may have accepted it. (Compare Mark 5: 14.)
What does this suggest about the effect that your bearing thorough witness might have?
How might people throughout the district of Asia have heard the truth?
Concerning his earlier ministry in Ephesus, Paul wrote that ‘ a large door that led to activity was opened to him. ’
What door, and how was it opened to him?
Paul’s continued ministry in Ephesus resulted in the spread of the good news.
Consider Colossae, Laodicea, and Hierapolis, three cities inland from Ephesus.
Paul never visited them, but the good news reached them.
Epaphras was from that area.
Did Epaphras hear Paul witness in Ephesus and become a Christian? The Bible does not specify.
But in spreading the truth in his home area, Epaphras may have represented Paul.
The Christian message may also have reached such cities as Philadelphia, Sardis, and Thyatira during the years Paul was bearing witness in Ephesus.
(a) Paul had what heartfelt desire?
(b) What will be the yeartext for 2009?
Consequently, the Ephesian elders had ample reason to accept Paul’s comment: “I do not make my soul of any account as dear to me, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received of the Lord Jesus, to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God. ”
That verse contains the positive, motivating yeartext for 2009: “Bear thorough witness to the good news. ” ​ — Acts 20: 24.
Bearing Thorough Witness Today
How do we know that we are to bear thorough witness?
The order “to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness ” came to include others besides the apostles.
When the resurrected Jesus spoke to disciples gathered in Galilee, likely 500 of them, he commanded: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. ”
That command applies to all true Christians today, as Jesus ’ words indicate: “Look!
I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things. ” ​ — Matt. 28: 19, 20.
Jehovah’s Witnesses are recognized for doing what important work?
Zealous Christians continue to obey that command, striving “to bear thorough witness to the good news. ” A key method of doing so is by means of what Paul mentioned to the Ephesian elders ​ — house - to - house preaching.
In a 2007 book on effective missionary work, David G. Stewart, Jr., said: “The practical, applied focus of the Jehovah’s Witnesses has proven far more effective at inspiring member - missionary participation than abstract, theoretical [urgings from pulpits].
For many Jehovah’s Witnesses, sharing their beliefs with others is a favorite activity. ”
The result? “In 1999, only 2 to 4 percent of people I surveyed in two Eastern European capitals reported ever being approached by Latter - day Saints or ‘ Mormon ’ missionaries.
Over 70 percent reported being personally approached by Jehovah’s Witnesses, often multiple times. ”
(a) Why do we call “multiple times ” at homes in our territory?
(b) Can you relate an experience of someone whose attitude toward our message changed?
Much the same might be said of people in your area.
You likely have contributed to that.
As you “personally approached ” people in your house - to - house ministry, you have spoken to men, women, and youths at the doors.
Some may not have listened even though approached “multiple times. ”
Others may have listened briefly as you shared a Bible verse or a Scriptural thought.
Yet, to others you have been able to give a fine witness, and they have responded.
All of those are possibilities as we “bear thorough witness to the good news. ”
As you likely know, there are countless examples of those who showed little interest when approached “multiple times, ” but then there was a change.
Perhaps something happened to them, or to a loved one, that opened their mind and heart to the truth.
Now they are our brothers and sisters. Hence, do not give up, even if you have not recently found many receptive ones.
We do not expect everyone to come into the truth.
But what God expects of us is that we diligently, zealously continue to bear thorough witness.
Results We May Not Know About
How could our bearing witness have results we may not know about?
The effect of Paul’s ministry was not limited to those whom he directly helped to become Christians; nor is that so in our case.
We make it a point to have a regular share in the house - to - house ministry, witnessing to as many as we can.
We speak of the good news to neighbors, coworkers, schoolmates, and relatives.
Do we know all the results? With some, there may be immediate good results.
In other cases, the seeds of truth may lie dormant for a time but then take root in the soil of someone’s heart and grow.
Even if that does not occur, people we speak to may talk with others about what we said, what we believe, and how we act.
Yes, it may be that they inadvertently enable those seeds to find receptive soil elsewhere.
14, 15.
Witnessing by one brother led to what results?
As just one example, consider Ryan and his wife, Mandi, who live in Florida, U.S.A.
At his place of employment, Ryan witnessed informally to a coworker.
That man, who had a Hindu background, was impressed by the way Ryan dressed and how he expressed himself.
In their conversations, Ryan raised such topics as the resurrection and the condition of the dead.
One January evening, the man asked his wife, Jodi, what she knew of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
She was a Catholic, and she said that the only thing she linked the Witnesses to was “door - to - door preaching. ”
So Jodi typed “Jehovah’s Witnesses ” in an Internet search engine, which led her to our Web site www.watchtower.org.
For months, Jodi read material on that site, including the Bible and articles of interest. In time, Jodi met Mandi, as both of them were nurses.
Mandi was pleased to answer Jodi’s questions. After some time, they had what Jodi terms “an Adam to Armageddon ” discussion.
Jodi accepted the offer of a home Bible study.
Soon she began going to the Kingdom Hall.
In October, Jodi became an unbaptized publisher, and she was baptized in February.
She writes: “Now that I know the truth, my life is very happy and fulfilled. ”
What does the experience of the brother in Florida suggest about our efforts to bear thorough witness?
Ryan had no idea that his witnessing to one man would result in someone else’s coming into the truth.
Granted, in his case, he did learn of the effect of his being determined to “bear thorough witness. ”
It might be, though, that you witness at a door, at work, in school, or in an informal setting, and unknown to you, it becomes the avenue for spreading truth to others. Even as Paul did not know of all his fruitage in “the district of Asia, ” you may have no way of knowing all the good results of your bearing thorough witness.
(Read Acts 23: 11; 28: 23.)
But how vital that you keep on doing so!
What are you determined to do during 2009?
During 2009, may we all take to heart our commission to witness from house to house and in other ways.
Thus, we will be in a position to express sentiments similar to Paul’s: “I do not make my soul of any account as dear to me, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received of the Lord Jesus, to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God. ”

Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
Highlights From the Letters of John and of Jude
LIKELY written in 98 C.E. from Ephesus, the three letters of the apostle John are among the last of the books making up the inspired Scriptures.
The first two letters encourage Christians to keep walking in the light and to fight against the encroachment of apostasy.
In the third one, John not only speaks of walking in the truth but also encourages Christian cooperation.
In his letter written from Palestine, probably in 65 C.E., Jesus ’ half brother Jude warns fellow Christians about wicked ones who had slipped into the congregation, and he gives advice about how to resist bad influences.
Paying attention to the message of the three letters of John and of Jude’s epistle can help us to remain strong in the faith despite obstacles. ​ — Heb. 4: 12.
KEEP WALKING IN THE LIGHT AND IN LOVE AND BY FAITH
(1 John 1: 1 – 5: 21)
He stresses the need to keep walking in the light and in love and by faith.
“If we are walking in the light as [God] himself is in the light, ” John writes,“ we do have a sharing with one another. ” And since God is the Source of love, the apostle says: “Let us continue loving one another. ”
While “the love of God ” moves us to“ observe his commandments, ” we conquer the world through “our faith ” in Jehovah God, his Word, and his Son. ​ — 1 John 1: 7; 4: 7; 5: 3, 4.
Scriptural Questions Answered: 2: 2; 4: 10 ​ — How is Jesus “a propitiatory sacrifice ”? To propitiate means to“ appease, ” or to “placate. ”
Jesus gave his life as a propitiatory sacrifice in the sense that by doing so, he appeased, or satisfied, the requirement of perfect justice.
On the basis of that sacrifice, God could extend mercy, and he could pardon the sins of those who exercise faith in Jesus. ​ — John 3: 16; Rom. 6: 23.
2: 7, 8 ​ — What commandment is John speaking of as “old ” as well as“ new ”?
John is speaking about the commandment regarding self - sacrificing brotherly love.
He refers to it as “old ” because Jesus gave it over 60 years before John penned his first inspired letter.
Thus, the believers have had it “from the beginning ” of their lives as Christians.
The commandment is also “new ” in that it goes beyond ‘ loving one’s fellow as oneself ’ and calls for self - sacrificing love. ​ — Lev.
19: 18; John 15: 12, 13.
5: 5 - 8 ​ — How did water, blood, and spirit bear witness to the fact that “Jesus is the Son of God ”?
Water was a witness bearer because when Jesus was baptized in water, Jehovah himself expressed His approval of him as His Son.
Jesus ’ blood, or life, given as “a corresponding ransom for all, ” also showed that Jesus is God’s Son.
And the holy spirit testified that Jesus is the Son of God when it descended upon him at his baptism, enabling him to go “through the land doing good and healing all those oppressed by the Devil. ” ​ — John 1: 29 - 34; Acts 10: 38.
Lessons for Us:
2: 9 - 11; 3: 15.
If a Christian allows anything or anyone to destroy his brotherly love, he is walking in spiritual darkness, not knowing where he is going.
KEEP “WALKING IN THE TRUTH ”
(2 John 1 - 13)
John opens his second letter by saying: “The older man to the chosen lady and to her children. ”
He expresses joy at finding “certain ones of [her] children walking in the truth. ” ​ — 2 John 1, 4.
After giving encouragement to cultivate love, John writes: “This is what love means, that we go on walking according to his commandments. ”
John also warns about “the deceiver and the antichrist. ” ​ — 2 John 5 - 7.
Scriptural Questions Answered:
1, 13 ​ — Who is “the chosen lady ”?
John could be referring to an individual woman addressed as Kyria, which is Greek for “lady. ”
Or he may be using a figure of speech to address a particular congregation in order to confuse persecutors.
7 ​ — What “coming ” of Jesus does John speak of here, and how are deceivers“ not confessing ” it?
The “coming ” is not Jesus ’ future, invisible coming. Rather, it is his coming in the flesh and his being anointed as the Christ.
Deceivers do not confess this coming in the flesh. Perhaps they deny that Jesus ever lived or they reject that he was anointed with holy spirit.
Lessons for Us:
2, 4.
Our coming to know “the truth ” ​ — the entire body of Christian teachings that has become part of the Bible — ​ and adhering to it are essential for our salvation. ​ — 3 John 3, 4.
8 - 11.
If we do not want to lose “undeserved kindness, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, ” as well as the loving association of fellow believers, we should“ look out ” for ourselves spiritually and reject those who do “not remain in the teaching of the Christ. ” ​ — 2 John 3.
BECOME “FELLOW WORKERS IN THE TRUTH ”
(3 John 1 - 14)
The third letter of John is addressed to his personal friend Gaius. “No greater cause for thankfulness do I have than these things, ” he writes,“ that I should be hearing that my children go on walking in the truth. ” ​ — 3 John 4.
John commends Gaius for “doing a faithful work ” in assisting visiting brothers.“ We... are under obligation to receive such persons hospitably, ” says the apostle, “that we may become fellow workers in the truth. ” ​ — 3 John 5 - 8.
Scriptural Questions Answered:
11 ​ — Why do some engage in bad conduct?
Lacking spirituality, some do not see God with their eyes of understanding.
Since they cannot see him with their literal eyes, they act as if he is not seeing them. ​ — Ezek.
9: 9.
14 ​ — Who are referred to as “friends ”?
The term “friends ” here includes more than those enjoying close relationships with one another.
John uses it to refer to fellow believers in general.
Lessons for Us: Spiritually mature individuals in the congregation experience great joy when they see its younger members “go on walking in the truth. ”
And what incomparable joy parents experience when they succeed in helping their offspring to become spiritually inclined children!
5 - 8.
Among those who work hard in behalf of their brothers out of love for them and for Jehovah are traveling overseers, missionaries, those serving in Bethel homes or branch offices, and those in the pioneer service.
Their faith is worthy of imitation, and they deserve our loving support.
9 - 12.
We should imitate the example of faithful Demetrius and not that of chattering Diotrephes, who was a slanderer.
“KEEP YOURSELVES IN GOD’S LOVE ”
(Jude 1 - 25)
Jude describes those infiltrating the congregation as “murmurers, complainers about their lot in life, proceeding according to their own desires. ” They“ speak swelling things, while they are admiring personalities. ” ​ — Jude 4, 16.
How can Christians resist bad influences?
“Beloved ones, ” writes Jude,“ call to mind the sayings that have been previously spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. ”
He adds: “Keep yourselves in God’s love. ” ​ — Jude 17 - 21.
Scriptural Questions Answered:
3, 4 ​ — Why did Jude urge Christians to “put up a hard fight for the faith ”?
Because ‘ ungodly men had slipped into the congregation. ’
These men were ‘ turning the undeserved kindness of God into an excuse for loose conduct. ’
20, 21 ​ — How can we “keep [ourselves] in God’s love ”?
We can do this in three ways: (1) by building up ourselves on our “most holy faith ” through diligent study of God’s Word and by having a zealous share in the preaching work; (2) by praying“ with holy spirit, ” or in harmony with its influence; and (3) by exercising faith in what makes everlasting life possible ​ — the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ. ​ — John 3: 16, 36.
Lessons for Us:
5 - 7.
Can the wicked escape Jehovah’s judgment?
According to the three warning examples listed by Jude, that is impossible.
8 - 10.
We should follow the example of Michael the archangel and show respect for divinely constituted authority.
Apostates feigning love are as dangerous to our faith as rocks hidden below water are to ships or swimmers.
False teachers may seem to be generous, but they are like waterless clouds in that they are spiritually empty.
Such ones are as fruitless as dead trees in late autumn.
They face destruction, as do uprooted trees.
Wise we are to shun apostates.
22, 23.
True Christians hate what is bad.
In an effort to save “some that have doubts ” out of the fire of everlasting destruction, mature ones in the congregation ​ — especially appointed overseers — ​ provide them with spiritual help.

Water, spirit, and blood bore witness that “Jesus is the Son of God ”
What Mary’s Example Can Teach Us
Have you ever felt overwhelmed by an unexpected challenge or responsibility?
Do you feel worn down by the daily struggle of making ends meet?
Maybe you are among the millions who feel bewildered and afraid because they have had to leave their homeland as refugees.
And who of us has not experienced deep pain and emptiness after losing a loved one in death?
DID you know that Mary, the mother of Jesus, faced all those challenges? What is more, she met them successfully!
What can we learn from her example? Mary is certainly known worldwide.
And no wonder, for she played a unique role in the outworking of God’s purposes.
Moreover, Mary is venerated by many millions of people.
The Catholic Church reveres her as a beloved Mother and as a model in faith, hope, and charity.
Many have been taught that Mary leads humans to God.
How do you view Jesus ’ mother?
And more important, how does God view her?
A Unique Assignment
Mary, the daughter of Heli, belonged to the Israelite tribe of Judah.
The first mention of her in the Bible is in connection with an extraordinary event.
An angel visited her and said: “Good day, highly favored one, Jehovah is with you. ”
At first, Mary was disturbed and “began to reason out what sort of greeting this might be. ”
So the angel told her that she had been chosen for the amazing but also extremely serious assignment of conceiving, bearing, and raising God’s Son. ​ — Luke 1: 26 - 33.
What a responsibility was placed on the shoulders of this young, unmarried woman!
How did she react?
Mary might well have wondered who would believe her story.
Might such a pregnancy cost her the love of Joseph, her fiancé, or might it subject her to public shame?
She did not hesitate to accept this weighty assignment.
Mary’s strong faith enabled her to submit to the will of her God, Jehovah.
She was convinced that he would look after her. She thus exclaimed: “Look!
Jehovah’s slave girl! May it take place with me according to your declaration. ”
Mary was willing to face the challenges that lay ahead because she valued the spiritual privilege she had been offered. ​ — Luke 1: 38.
When Mary told Joseph that she was pregnant, he intended to break off their engagement.
That must have been a time of great anguish for both of them.
The Bible does not say how long this difficult period lasted.
However, both Mary and Joseph must have felt extremely relieved when Jehovah’s angel appeared to Joseph.
That spirit emissary explained Mary’s extraordinary pregnancy and directed Joseph to take her home as his wife. ​ — Matthew 1: 19 - 24.
Hard Times
Today, many mothers - to - be spend months preparing for the arrival of a baby, and Mary may have done the same.
This was to be her first child. Yet, unexpected events complicated her plans.
Caesar Augustus decreed a census, requiring all to register in their town of origin.
So Joseph took Mary, now in her ninth month of pregnancy, on a journey of about 90 miles [150 km], likely on a donkey’s back!
Bethlehem was crowded and Mary needed somewhere private to give birth, but the only place available was a stable.
Giving birth in a stable must have been hard for Mary.
She may well have been both embarrassed and scared.
In these critical moments of her life, Mary surely poured her heart out to Jehovah, trusting that he would care for her and her baby.
Later some shepherds arrived, eager to see the baby.
They reported that angels had called this child “a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. ”
Then we read: “Mary began to preserve all these sayings, drawing conclusions in her heart. ”
She meditated on these words and drew strength from them. ​ — Luke 2: 11, 16 - 19. What about us?
We are likely to suffer pain in life.
Furthermore, the Bible shows that “time and unforeseen occurrence ” can befall any of us, throwing all manner of hardships and challenges in our path.
If that happens, do we turn bitter, blaming God?
Would it not be better to imitate Mary’s attitude and draw closer to Jehovah God by learning from his Word, the Bible, and then meditating on what we have learned?
Doing so will surely help us to endure trials. Poor and a Refugee
Mary faced other hardships too ​ — including poverty and a forced flight from her homeland.
Have you faced such challenges? According to one report, “half the world ​ — nearly three billion people — ​ live on less than two dollars a day, ” and millions more struggle to make ends meet even though they live in so - called wealthy countries.
What about you? Does the day - to - day grind of providing your family with food, clothing, and shelter tire you out, even overwhelm you at times?
The Bible indicates that Joseph and Mary were relatively poor.
How so? Among the few facts that the Gospels ​ — Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John — ​ reveal about this couple is that 40 days after Mary gave birth, she and Joseph went to the temple to make the required offering ​ — “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons. ”
* This sacrifice was allowed only for those who were too poor to offer a young male sheep.
Thus, making ends meet was likely a struggle for Joseph and Mary.
Doubtless, spiritual concerns were their priority. ​ — Deuteronomy 6: 6, 7.
Not long after Jesus ’ birth, Mary’s life was once again turned upside down.
An angel told Joseph to take his family and flee to Egypt.
This was the second time that Mary had to leave a familiar environment, but this time she had to go to a foreign country.
Egypt hosted a large Jewish community, so Mary and Joseph may have been able to live among their own people.
Nonetheless, living in a foreign country can be challenging and disorienting.
Are you and your family among the many millions who have left their homeland, perhaps for the welfare of their children or to escape danger?
If so, you can well understand some of the hardships that Mary may have faced in Egypt.
A Devoted Wife and Mother
Apart from the accounts of the birth and infancy of Jesus, Mary is mentioned little in the Gospels.
Yet, we know that Mary and Joseph had at least six other children.
You may find this surprising.
Joseph had great respect for Mary’s privilege of bearing God’s Son. Consequently, he refrained from having sexual intercourse with her before Jesus ’ birth.
Matthew 1: 25 states that Joseph “had no intercourse with her until she gave birth to a son. ”
The word “until ” in this verse indicates that after Jesus ’ birth, Joseph and Mary had normal sexual relations as husband and wife.
The Gospel accounts say that, as a result, Mary had children with Joseph, both sons and daughters. James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas were Jesus ’ half brothers.
She had at least two daughters. However, these children were conceived in the usual manner.
Mary was a spiritually - minded person.
Although the Law did not require women to attend the Passover celebration, Mary customarily accompanied Joseph on the annual journey to Jerusalem for the festival.
That would have involved a round - trip of nearly 190 miles [300 km] each year ​ — with a growing family!
But these trips were doubtless happy family occasions.
Many women today imitate Mary’s fine example.
They work hard and selflessly to fulfill their Scriptural obligations.
How often these devoted wives show great patience, endurance, and humility!
Reflecting on Mary’s attitude helps them keep spiritual matters ahead of their own desire for comfort and pleasure.
They know, as Mary doubtless did, that worshipping God together with their husband and children strengthens and unifies the family.
Once when Mary and Joseph were returning from a festival in Jerusalem ​ — probably with several children now — ​ they realized that 12 - year - old Jesus was not with them.
Can you imagine the distress Mary felt during the frantic three - day search for her son?
When she and Joseph finally found him in the temple, Jesus said: “Did you not know that I must be in the house of my Father? ”
Here is another indication of Mary’s depth of spirituality.
She carefully meditated upon all that happened regarding Jesus.
Years later, she likely recounted vivid memories concerning this and other events of Jesus ’ early life to the Gospel writers. ​ — Luke 2: 41 - 52.
Enduring in the Face of Suffering and Loss
What became of Joseph, Jesus ’ adoptive father?
After briefly appearing in the description of that one incident from Jesus ’ youth, Joseph disappears from the Gospel record.
Some take this absence as an indication that Joseph died sometime before Jesus ’ ministry began.
* In any case, it does seem that Mary was a widow by the end of Jesus ’ ministry.
At the time of his death, Jesus entrusted his mother to the apostle John.
Jesus would not likely have done so if Joseph were still living.
Mary and Joseph had been through so much together!
They were visited by angels, escaped a tyrant, relocated several times, and raised a large family.
How many evenings must they have sat together and talked about Jesus, wondering what he would have to face in the future, concerned about whether they were training him and preparing him in the right way?
Then suddenly Mary found herself alone.
Have you lost your mate in death?
Do you still feel the pain and emptiness such a loss causes, even after many years?
No doubt Mary found solace in her faith and in the knowledge that there will be a resurrection.
* Such comforting thoughts, however, did not end Mary’s problems.
Like so many single mothers today, she faced the challenge of caring for her children without the help of a husband.
It is reasonable to believe that Jesus took over as the main breadwinner of the family when Joseph died.
As Jesus ’ brothers grew, they would be able to accept their share of family responsibilities.
When Jesus “was about thirty years old, ” he left home and commenced his ministry.
Most parents have mixed emotions when a grown son or daughter leaves home.
So much time, effort, and emotion are invested in children that a huge void may seem to linger when they leave.
Have any of your sons or daughters left home to pursue their goals?
Are you proud of them, but at the same time, do you sometimes wish they were nearer?
Then you can imagine how Mary may have felt when Jesus left home.
Unexpected Trials
Another of Mary’s trials was one she probably never expected.
As Jesus preached, many followed him ​ — but not his own brothers.
“His brothers were, in fact, not exercising faith in him, ” say the Scriptures.
Mary, no doubt, told them what the angel had told her ​ — that Jesus was “God’s Son. ”
Still, to James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas, Jesus was just their older brother.
So Mary found herself in a family with differing religious viewpoints.
Did Mary get discouraged and give up on the situation? Absolutely not!
On one occasion when Jesus was preaching in Galilee, he went to a house to eat, and a crowd gathered to listen to him.
Whom do we find outside looking for him?
Mary and Jesus ’ brothers.
So when Jesus was near the family home, she followed him and evidently took her other children along with her, maybe hoping that they would change their attitude toward him. ​ — Matthew 12: 46, 47.
You may similarly be faced with the challenge of striving to follow Jesus while other members of your family do not want to do so.
Do not become downhearted, and do not give up!
Many, like Mary, have patiently encouraged family members for years before seeing any real change.
The Hardest Challenge
Mary’s last trial, as recorded in the Scriptures, was no doubt the most heart - wrenching.
She watched her beloved son die in agony after he was rejected by his people.
The death of a child has been described as “the ultimate loss, ”“ the most devastating death, ” whether the child is still young or he is an adult.
Just as had been foretold decades earlier, Mary felt as if a sword had been run through her! ​ — Luke 2: 34, 35.
Did Mary let this final test destroy her emotionally or let it weaken her faith in Jehovah?
No. The next time Mary is mentioned in the Bible record, we find her with Jesus ’ disciples, “persisting in prayer ” with them.
And she was not alone. Her other sons, who by this time had begun to exercise faith in their older brother, were with her.
How that must have comforted Mary!
* ​ — Acts 1: 14.
Mary had a full and satisfying life as a faithful woman, wife, and mother.
She had many spiritually rewarding experiences.
She overcame many tests and trials.
When we face unexpected challenges or when we are anxious over family problems, we can certainly learn from her example of faithful endurance. ​ — Hebrews 10: 36.
What though, can be said about Mary as an object of special religious devotion?
Does the Bible account of Mary’s unique role justify her being venerated?
One of the birds was offered as a sin offering.
By presenting it, Mary acknowledged that she, like all other imperfect humans, had inherited the consequences of the sin of Adam, the first human. ​ — Romans 5: 12.
See the box “Did Jesus Have Brothers and Sisters? ”
It has been noted that Joseph’s absence from the record of Jesus ’ ministry is remarkable because Jesus ’ other family members ​ — his mother, brothers, and sisters — ​ are mentioned.
At the wedding feast in Cana, for example, we see Mary actively involved and even taking some initiative, but there is no sign of Joseph.
In another incident, we find the people of Christ’s hometown referring to the man Jesus, not as the son of Joseph, but as “the son of Mary. ” ​ — Mark 6: 3.
For more information about the Bible’s promise of a resurrection, see chapter 7 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach?
published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.
See the box “She Had the Courage to Change, ” on page 7.
[Box / ​ Picture on page 6]
Did Jesus Have Brothers and Sisters?
Yes, he did.
Some theologians have tried to argue their way out of that truth, though the Gospels several times clearly reveal the fact.
However, Bible scholars have noted two things about the theories that Mary bore no other children.
One, there is a motive behind such theories ​ — to uphold a doctrine that arose much later, the church teaching that Mary remained a virgin throughout her life.
Two, the theories themselves do not hold up under scrutiny.
For example, one such theory suggests that the “brothers ” in question were stepbrothers ​ — sons of Joseph by an earlier marriage.
This notion lacks substance, for it would actually deny Jesus the legal right of the firstborn to inherit the kingship of David. ​ — 2 Samuel 7: 12, 13.
Another theory is that these brothers were actually cousins of Jesus, although the Greek Scriptures use distinct words for “brother, ”“ cousin, ” and “relative. ”
Thus, scholar Frank E.
Gaebelein calls these theological theories farfetched.
He concludes: “The most natural way to understand ‘ brothers ’... is that the term refers to sons of Mary and Joseph and thus to brothers of Jesus on his mother’s side. ”
[Box on page 7]
She Had the Courage to Change
Mary was born into a Jewish family, and she followed the Jewish religion.
She attended the local synagogue, as the Jewish place of worship is called, and she visited the temple in Jerusalem.
As Mary’s knowledge of God’s purposes grew, however, she came to see that the traditions of her fathers no longer had God’s approval.
Jewish religious leaders had her Son, the Messiah, put to death.
Before that happened, Jesus announced to them: “Look!
Your house is abandoned to you. ”
God withdrew his blessing from the religious system in which Mary had been raised. ​ — Galatians 2: 15, 16.
When the Christian congregation was formed, Mary may have been about 50 or so.
What would she do?
Did she reason that she had been born into the Jewish religious system and that she wanted to remain loyal to the traditions of her forefathers?
Did she say that she was too old to change?
Of course not! Mary understood that God’s blessing was now with the Christian congregation, so she had the faith and courage to change.

The worst experience a mother can go through
Mary’s Role in God’s Purpose
DURING Jesus ’ ministry, a woman raised her voice above the din of the crowd and called out: “Happy is the womb that carried you and the breasts that you sucked! ”
If Jesus wanted his mother to be revered, he had here a golden opportunity to recommend that form of devotion.
Instead, he replied: “No, rather, Happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it! ” ​ — Luke 11: 27, 28.
Jesus did not single out his mother for any special honors; nor did he ever tell his followers to do so.
How does this fit in with the adoration that many sincere believers bestow on Mary?
Let us consider some of the widespread teachings about Jesus ’ mother in the light of the Holy Scriptures.
“Full of Grace, ”“ Blessed...
Among Women ” The angel Gabriel announced to Mary what her role in God’s purpose would be.
On that occasion, he greeted her, saying: “Good day, highly favored one, Jehovah is with you. ”
An alternative translation of that same greeting is: “Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you. ”
Soon thereafter, Elizabeth greeted Mary with the words: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! ”
Do these phrases not indicate that particular reverence is due Mary?
Although these words are incorporated in a prayer that Catholics direct to Mary, the Bible itself gives no justification for praying to her.
Gabriel and Elizabeth acknowledged Mary’s outstanding privilege as the one who was to bear the Messiah, but the thought of praying to her is alien to the Scriptures.
On the contrary, when Jesus ’ disciples asked him to teach them how to pray, he indicated that prayers were to be directed to his Father.
In fact, Jesus ’ famous model prayer begins with the words: “Our Father in the heavens. ” ​ — Matthew 6: 9.
Among the Rulers
Another common teaching about Mary is that she is now “the Queen of heaven. ”
The Bible never accords her such a title.
It does show, however, that she occupies a special place in God’s heavenly arrangement.
What place is that?
Jesus indicated that some of his faithful disciples would rule with him in his Kingdom.
Jesus will empower those chosen ones to serve as “priests to our God, and they are to rule as kings over the earth. ”
The Bible clearly leads us to the conclusion that Mary is among those who have been granted this exalted privilege.
How can we say this?
You will recall that after Jesus ’ death, Mary was “persisting in prayer ” with Jesus ’ disciples and his brothers.
Some 120 met for this purpose, including “some women. ”
While “the festival of Pentecost was in progress, ” says the Bible,“ they were all together at the same place ” when God’s holy spirit was poured out upon them, granting them the ability to speak in foreign languages. ​ — Acts 2: 1 - 4.
That Mary was among those blessed in this way shows that she and the other women who received the holy spirit were chosen to be a part of Jesus ’ heavenly Kingdom.
So we have every reason to believe that Mary now sits with Jesus in heavenly glory.
Consider some of the privileges that she and Jesus ’ other corulers will have in the outworking of God’s purposes.
Dispensing Marvelous Blessings
The Bible book of Revelation says that 144,000 individuals would be resurrected to heavenly glory to serve alongside Jesus as priests, judges, and kings.
As priests, they will share in applying the merits of Jesus ’ sacrifice to all obedient mankind, raising them to spiritual, moral, and physical perfection.
What a privilege it will be for all loyal worshippers of Jehovah to see that wonderful time!
Mary played, and still plays, a part in the outworking of Jehovah’s purposes.
For her humility, faith, obedience, and devotion as a mother, not to mention her endurance under trial, she is worthy of imitation.
For her role in giving birth to the Messiah and in dispensing everlasting blessings to mankind, she is to be highly respected.
However, the most important lesson we learn from Mary is that she, along with all other faithful servants of God, worships Jehovah and no other god.
Mary, along with Christ’s other corulers in heaven, raises her voice to proclaim: “To the One sitting on the throne [Jehovah God] and to the Lamb [Jesus Christ] be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever. ” ​ — Revelation 5: 13; 19: 10.
For more information concerning these blessings, see chapter 8 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach? published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.
[Blurb on page 10]
Mary’s humility, faith, and obedience are worthy of imitation
Do You Fear the Dead?
TO THIS question, many answer with a simple, “No.
They believe that the deceased really are dead.
In Benin, West Africa, many believe that the dead can return to kill other members of their own family.
People sell possessions or go into debt to pay for animal sacrifices and ceremonies to appease dead relatives.
Some practice spiritism, which includes the idea that a spirit part of humans survives at death and can communicate with the living.
Others have fearsome experiences that they attribute to the influence of spirits of the dead.
One who had such an experience is Agboola, a man who lives near the border between Benin and Nigeria.
He says: “Spiritism dominates life in our area.
It is the custom to wash corpses ceremonially to prepare them for the spirit realm.
I often gathered up leftover soap and mixed it with certain leaves.
Then, as I applied the concoction to my hunting rifle, I said aloud which type of game I wanted to shoot.
Practices like this are common and seemed to be quite effective.
However, some aspects of spiritism were frightening.
“When two of my sons died mysteriously, I suspected that someone was practicing spiritism against me.
To find out, I went to an old man, renowned for his spiritistic powers. He confirmed my suspicions.
Worse, he explained that my sons were now waiting in the spirit world to become servants of their killer when he died.
The old man added that my third son was doomed to the same fate. A few days later, that son too was dead. ”
Agboola then met John, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses from neighboring Nigeria.
John’s explanation of the condition of the dead was based on the Bible.
That explanation changed Agboola’s life.
It can change yours too. Are the Dead Alive?
Who can best answer this question?
Not some man, however renowned he might be.
Rather, Jehovah, the Creator of all life “in the heavens and upon the earth, the things visible and the things invisible, ” has the answer.
He created angels to inhabit the spirit realm and man and animals to live on the earth.
Life everywhere is dependent on Him.
Consider, then, what God’s own Word, the Bible, says about death.
Jehovah was the first to speak of death. He warned that Adam and Eve would die if they disobeyed him.
What did that mean?
Jehovah explained: “Dust you are and to dust you will return. ”
At death the body disintegrates; it goes back to the dust.
Life ceases. Adam and Eve were willfully disobedient and were therefore sentenced to death.
They, however, were not the first to die. Their son Abel was. His older brother, Cain, murdered him.
Cain did not fear that his dead brother could take vengeance.
Rather, Cain was apprehensive about what living men might do to him. ​ — Genesis 4: 10 - 16.
Many centuries later, King Herod was agitated when astrologers informed him that a “king of the Jews ” had been born in his realm.
Bent on eliminating this potential rival, Herod schemed to have all boys in Bethlehem two years of age and under slain.
But an angel warned Joseph to take Jesus and Mary and “flee into Egypt. ” ​ — Matthew 2: 1 - 16.
When Herod died, the angel told Joseph to return to Israel, “for those who were seeking the soul of the young child [were] dead. ”
The angel, a spirit himself, knew that Herod could harm Jesus no more.
Joseph had no fear of the dead King Herod.
However, Joseph was afraid of what Herod’s tyrannical son, Archelaus, could do.
So Joseph settled his family in Galilee, outside of Archelaus ’ jurisdiction. ​ — Matthew 2: 22.
These accounts help us to see that the dead are powerless.
How, then, can the experiences of Agboola and others be explained?
“Demons, ” or Unclean Spirits
As an adult, Jesus encountered wicked spirit creatures.
They recognized Jesus and addressed him as the “Son of God. ” Jesus likewise knew who they were.
They were not spirits of dead humans.
Rather, Jesus identified them as “demons, ” or unclean spirits. ​ — Matthew 8: 29 - 31; 10: 8; Mark 5: 8.
The Bible speaks of spirits loyal to God and of those who have rebelled against him.
The book of Genesis says that when Jehovah drove disobedient Adam and Eve out of the garden of Eden, he posted cherubs, or angels, to the east of the garden to prevent anyone from entering it.
This was apparently the first time that spirits became visible to humans.
Some time later, a number of angels came to earth and took on human form.
Jehovah had not commissioned them to carry out any assignment on earth.
Instead, they “forsook their own proper dwelling place ” in the spirit realm.
They took wives, who gave birth to hybrid offspring called Nephilim.
The Nephilim and their rebellious fathers filled the earth with violence and other great badness.
Jehovah dealt with the situation by bringing the global Deluge of Noah’s day. Floodwaters destroyed wicked men and women as well as the hybrids.
What happened to the angels?
The Flood forced them back into the spirit realm.
Jehovah, however, prevented them from resuming “their original position. ”
The Bible states: “God did not hold back from punishing the angels that sinned, but, by throwing them into Tartarus, delivered them to pits of dense darkness to be reserved for judgment. ” ​ — 2 Peter 2: 4.
Tartarus is not a particular location; it is a prisonlike, abased condition that limits the activity of these outcasts.
The demons can no longer materialize, but they still have great power and influence over minds and lives.
They can possess humans and animals.
They also deceive humans by posing as the spirits of the dead. Why?
To keep people from worshipping Jehovah in a way that pleases him and to confuse them regarding the real condition of the dead.
How to Overcome Fear
Agboola saw the reasonableness of the Bible’s explanations regarding death and the identity of the spirits.
He understood that he needed to learn more.
He began to read the Bible and Bible - based publications with John.
Agboola found comfort in the knowledge that his sons were asleep in the grave, not waiting in the spirit realm to become their killer’s servants. ​ — John 11: 11 - 13.
Agboola also realized that he had to make a complete break with spiritistic practices.
He burned all his possessions connected with the occult.
Some in the community warned him that the spirits would react unfavorably.
He followed the counsel found at Ephesians 6: 11, 12: “Put on the complete suit of armor from God... because we have a wrestling... against the wicked spirit forces. ”
This spiritual suit of armor includes truth, righteousness, the good news of peace, faith, and the sword of the spirit, God’s Word.
Such armor originates with God and is powerful!
Agboola was ostracized by some of his friends and relatives when he shunned customs associated with spiritism.
However, at the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses, he found new friends, who believe what the Bible teaches.
Agboola now knows that Jehovah will soon cleanse the earth of wickedness and will reduce the demons to total inactivity.
Eventually, He will destroy them.
God will resurrect here on the earth “all those in the memorial tombs. ”
That will include Abel, the innocent children whom King Herod murdered, and millions of others.
Agboola has faith that his three sons will be included.
Your loved ones who have died may well be among them.
All such resurrected ones will confirm that from their death to their resurrection, they were completely unconscious ​ — unaware of any ceremonies performed for them.
You have no reason to fear the dead.
Rather, you can look forward to being reunited with dead loved ones.
In the meantime, why not study the Bible to strengthen your faith?
Associate with those who believe what the Bible teaches.
If you dabble in spiritism, stop immediately.
Protect yourself from the demons by putting on “the complete suit of armor from God. ” Jehovah’s Witnesses will be happy to help you.
They offer free home Bible studies, using the book What Does the Bible Really Teach? *
Agboola no longer fears the dead, and he has learned how to resist the demons.
He says: “I don’t know who caused the deaths of my three sons.
But since I have been serving Jehovah, I have had seven other children.
No one in the spirit realm has ever harmed them. ”

Be Thankful for the Rain
RAIN! What would we do without it?
True, too much rain can cause disastrous floods.
Also, people who live in cold, wet climates or seasons like that may not always enjoy the rain.
But what about the millions who must endure hot, dry weather much of the time?
When at last the rains come, they are, oh, so refreshing!
That was the case in Bible lands, such as the interior of Asia Minor, where the apostle Paul did missionary work.
While there, Paul told the ancient Lycaonians: “[God] did not leave himself without witness in that he did good, giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts to the full with food and good cheer. ”
Note that Paul mentioned rain first, for without it nothing could grow and there would be no “fruitful seasons. ”
The Bible has a lot to say about rain.
The Hebrew and Greek words for rain appear in the Bible more than one hundred times.
Would you like to know more about the remarkable gift of rain?
At the same time, would you like to strengthen your faith in the scientific accuracy of the Bible?
What the Bible Says About Rain
Jesus Christ drew attention to a vital provision without which there would be no rain.
“Your Father, ” said Jesus,“ makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous. ”
Did you notice that Jesus referred to the sun before mentioning the rain?
That is fitting because the sun not only provides plants with energy to grow but also drives earth’s water cycle.
Yes, it is the heat from the sun that causes an approximate 100,000 cubic miles [400,000 km] of seawater to evaporate into freshwater vapor each year.
Because Jehovah God created the sun, he is rightly called the one who draws up water to make rain.
The Bible describes the water cycle, saying: “God... draws up the drops of water; they filter as rain for his mist, so that the clouds trickle, they drip upon mankind abundantly. ”
In the thousands of years since those scientifically accurate words were written, man has had a lot of time to try to understand the water cycle.
“Currently, ” states the 2003 textbook Water Science and Engineering,“ the mechanism of raindrop formation is not known with certainty. ”
What scientists do know is that raindrops are formed from microscopic particles that become the nuclei of tiny droplets in clouds.
Each of these droplets must increase in size a million or more times to make a single drop of rain.
It is a complex process that can take several hours.
A science textbook, Hydrology in Practice, states: “There are several theories of how cloud droplets grow to become raindrops, and investigations into the details of several proposed methods continue to claim the attention of research workers. ”
The Creator of the mechanisms that produce rain could ask his servant Job these humbling questions: “Does there exist a father for the rain, or who gave birth to the dewdrops?
Who put wisdom in the cloud layers?...
Who can exactly number the clouds in wisdom, or the water jars of heaven ​ — who can tip them over? ”
Some 3,500 years later, scientists still grapple with these difficult questions.
Which Way Does the Water Cycle Go?
Greek philosophers taught that the source of river water was not rain but seawater that somehow flowed under the earth to the top of the mountains, becoming fresh springwater.
One Bible commentary claims that Solomon embraced such a notion.
Consider Solomon’s inspired words: “All the winter torrents are going forth to the sea, yet the sea itself is not full.
To the place where the winter torrents are going forth, there they are returning so as to go forth. ”
Did Solomon really mean that seawater was somehow piped up the inside of mountains to become the source of rivers?
To answer that question, let us see what Solomon’s fellow countrymen believed about the water cycle.
Were they bound by false notions?
Less than a hundred years after Solomon’s day, God’s prophet Elijah showed his knowledge about the direction from which to expect rain.
During his day, the land experienced a severe drought for over three years.
Jehovah God brought this calamity upon his people because they had rejected him in favor of the Canaanite rain - god, Baal.
But Elijah helped to bring the Israelites to repentance, so he was now willing to pray for rain.
While praying, Elijah asked his attendant to look “in the direction of the sea. ”
On being informed of “a small cloud like a man’s palm ascending out of the sea, ” Elijah knew that his prayer was answered.
Soon, “the heavens themselves darkened up with clouds and wind and a great downpour began to occur. ”
Thus Elijah showed an awareness of the water cycle.
He knew that clouds would form over the sea to be blown eastward by winds over the Promised Land.
To this day, that is the method by which the land gets its rain.
About one hundred years after Elijah’s prayer for rain, a humble farmer named Amos emphasized an important detail about the source of the water cycle.
Amos was used by God to prophesy against the Israelites for oppressing the poor and for worshipping false gods.
Lest they perish at God’s hand, Amos urged them to “search for Jehovah, and keep living. ”
Then Amos explained that Jehovah alone should be worshipped because he is the Creator, “the One calling for the waters of the sea, that he may pour them out upon the surface of the earth. ”
Amos later repeated this wonderful fact about the water cycle and its direction.
Amos thus showed that the oceans are the main source of earth’s rain.
This fact was scientifically proved by Edmond Halley in 1687.
Yet, it took time before others accepted Halley’s evidence.
“The idea that there is a circulatory system within the Earth, by which seawater is conveyed to mountaintops and there discharged, persisted until early in the 18th century, ” states Encyclopædia Britannica Online.
Today, the truth about the direction of the water cycle is common knowledge.
The same source explains: “The waters of the sea are evaporated, are subsequently condensed within the atmosphere, fall to the Earth as precipitation, and finally flow in the rivers back to the sea. ”
Clearly, then, Solomon’s words about the rain cycle, recorded at Ecclesiastes 1: 7, refer to the same process involving clouds and rain.
What Should This Move You to Do?
The fact that the water cycle was so accurately described by various Bible writers is one of many outstanding proofs that the Bible is inspired by mankind’s Creator, Jehovah God.
True, man’s mismanagement of the earth has apparently thrown the weather patterns off balance, resulting in severe floods in some areas and droughts in others.
But the Creator of the water cycle, Jehovah God, long ago promised that he would eventually intervene and “bring to ruin those ruining the earth. ” ​ — Revelation 11: 18.
In the meantime, how can you show your appreciation for God’s gifts, such as the rain?
You can do so by studying his Word, the Bible, and applying in your life what you learn.
Then you will have the hope of surviving into God’s new world, where you will be able to enjoy all of God’s gifts forever.
For, indeed, “every good gift and every perfect present ” comes from the Source of the rain, Jehovah God. ​ — James 1: 17.

“Come Be My Follower ”
“If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and follow me. ” ​ — LUKE 9: 23.
1, 2. (a) What kind invitation did Jesus offer?
(b) How have you responded to Jesus ’ invitation?
TOWARD the end of his ministry, Jesus was witnessing in Perea, a region across the Jordan, northeast of Judea.
He was approached by a young man who asked what he had to do to inherit everlasting life.
Jesus, after ascertaining that the young man was faithfully observing the Mosaic Law, issued an outstanding invitation.
He said: “Go, sell what things you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven, and come be my follower. ”
Just think ​ — an invitation to follow Jesus, the only - begotten Son of the Most High God!
That young man rejected the invitation, but others accepted it. Earlier, Jesus had said to Philip: “Be my follower. ”
Philip accepted and later became an apostle.
Jesus repeated the invitation to Matthew, and he too accepted it.
Indeed, Jesus offered the same invitation to all lovers of righteousness when he said: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and follow me continually. ”
Hence, anyone can be Jesus ’ follower if he really wants to.
Do you have that desire?
Most of us have already responded positively to Jesus ’ kind invitation, and in the field ministry, we convey that invitation to others.
How can we avoid drifting away from following Jesus?
Sadly, though, some who have shown an interest in Bible truth do not continue. Rather, they slow down and eventually “drift away ” from following Jesus.
How can we avoid falling into that trap?
It helps if we ask ourselves: ‘ Why did I choose to follow Jesus in the first place?
What does it mean to follow him? ’
Bearing the answers to those two questions in mind will help us to strengthen our resolve to remain on the fine path we have chosen. It will also help us to encourage others to follow Jesus.
Why Follow Jesus?
4, 5.
Why is Jesus qualified to lead?
The prophet Jeremiah stated: “I well know, O Jehovah, that to earthling man his way does not belong.
It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step. ”
History has borne out the truth of Jeremiah’s words.
It has become increasingly evident that imperfect humans cannot successfully govern themselves.
We accepted the invitation to follow Jesus because we learned that he is qualified to be our Leader in a way that no human could ever be.
Consider some of Jesus ’ qualifications.
First, Jesus was chosen as Messiah the Leader by Jehovah himself.
Who knows better than our Creator whom to appoint as a Leader for us?
Second, Jesus has qualities that we can admire and imitate.
(Read Isaiah 11: 2, 3.)
He is a perfect example.
Third, Jesus deeply cares about those who follow him, as he showed when he laid down his life for them. (Read John 10: 14, 15.)
And he shows himself to be a caring shepherd as he guides us to a life that brings happiness now and leads to a glorious eternal future.
For these and other reasons, we made a wise decision when we chose to follow him.
What, though, does such a course involve?
What is involved in following Jesus?
Some two billion people claim to be Christian today, but their actions reveal them to be “workers of lawlessness. ”
(Read Matthew 7: 21 - 23.)
When individuals show an interest in the invitation to follow Jesus, we explain to them that true Christians pattern their entire way of life after his teachings and example ​ — and they do so every day of their lives.
To illustrate what this means, consider some of the things that we know about Jesus.
Imitate Jesus ’ Example of Wisdom
7, 8. (a) What is wisdom, and why did Jesus possess it so abundantly?
(b) How did Jesus demonstrate wisdom, and how can we imitate him?
Jesus manifested many outstanding qualities, but we will focus on four: his wisdom, his humility, his zeal, and his love.
First, consider his wisdom ​ — his ability to put knowledge and understanding to work in a practical way.
The apostle Paul wrote: “Carefully concealed in [Jesus] are all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge. ”
Where did Jesus get such wisdom? He himself said: “Just as the Father taught me I speak these things. ”
His wisdom originated with Jehovah, so we are not surprised at the soundness of Jesus ’ judgment.
For example, Jesus used good judgment in choosing his life course.
He decided to keep his life simple, focusing on just one thing: the doing of God’s will.
He wisely devoted his time and energy to furthering Kingdom interests.
We follow Jesus ’ example by striving to keep a ‘ simple eye ’ and thus avoid weighing ourselves down with unnecessary things that consume our energy and attention.
Many Christians have taken steps to simplify their lifestyle so that they can devote more time to the ministry.
Some have been able to enter the pioneer service.
If you are one of those, that is most commendable.
“Seeking first the kingdom ” brings great happiness and satisfaction. ​ — Matt. 6: 33. Be Humble Like Jesus
9, 10.
How did Jesus demonstrate his humility?
The second aspect of Jesus ’ personality that we will consider is his humility.
When imperfect humans are given authority, they often develop an inflated sense of their own importance.
How different it was with Jesus!
Despite his key position in the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose, Jesus was free of even the slightest hint of haughtiness.
And we are encouraged to imitate him in that.
The apostle Paul wrote: “Keep this mental attitude in you that was also in Christ Jesus, who, although he was existing in God’s form, gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.
No, but he emptied himself and took a slave’s form and came to be in the likeness of men. ”
What did that involve?
Jesus enjoyed the glorious privilege of dwelling in his Father’s heavenly presence, but he willingly “emptied himself. ”
His life was transferred to the womb of a Jewish virgin, there to develop for nine months until he was born as a helpless infant in the household of a lowly carpenter.
In Joseph’s house, Jesus gradually grew to be a toddler, a little boy, and then a teenager.
He was sinless. Yet, throughout his youth he remained subject to parents who were imperfect sinners.
What extraordinary humility!
In what ways can we imitate Jesus ’ humility?
We imitate Jesus ’ humility when we willingly accept assignments that might seem lowly.
As an example, consider the assignment to preach the good news.
Such work may appear lowly, especially when people respond with apathy, ridicule, or hostility.
However, by persisting in the preaching work, we help others to respond to Jesus ’ invitation to follow him.
Thus we help to save lives. (Read 2 Timothy 4: 1 - 5.)
Another example is the maintenance of our Kingdom Hall. That can involve such things as emptying trash cans, mopping floors, and cleaning washrooms ​ — all humble tasks!
Still, we recognize that maintaining our Kingdom Hall ​ — the center of pure worship in the locality — ​ is part of our sacred service.
By willingly completing tasks that seem lowly, we show humility and thus follow in the footsteps of Christ.
Like Jesus, Be Zealous
12, 13. (a) How did Jesus demonstrate zeal, and what motivated him?
(b) What will motivate us to be zealous in the ministry?
Consider Jesus ’ zeal in the ministry.
Jesus did many things when he was on earth.
In his early life, he likely worked with his adoptive father, Joseph, as a carpenter. During his ministry, Jesus performed miracles, including healing the sick and raising the dead.
But his main work was that of preaching the good news and teaching those who had listening ears.
As his followers, we have the same work to do.
How can we follow his example?
For one thing, we can cultivate motives like those of Jesus.
Above all, love for God motivated Jesus to preach and to teach. But Jesus also loved the truths he taught.
To him, those truths were priceless treasures, and he was eager to share them with others.
We as teachers, or ‘ public instructors, ’ feel the same way. Just think of some of the precious truths we have learned from God’s Word!
We know of the issue of universal sovereignty and how it will be settled. We well understand what the Scriptures teach about the condition of the dead and the blessings to come in God’s new world.
Whether we learned such truths in recent times or long ago, they never fade in value.
Old or new, such truths are, indeed, priceless treasures. (Read Matthew 13: 52.)
By preaching with heartfelt enthusiasm, we convey to others our love for what Jehovah has taught us.
How can we imitate Jesus ’ manner of teaching?
Notice, too, how Jesus taught.
He constantly directed his hearers to the Scriptures.
He frequently introduced an important point by saying: “It is written. ”
In his recorded words, he quoted directly from or referred indirectly to over half of the books of the Hebrew Scriptures.
Like Jesus, we rely heavily on the Bible in our ministry and endeavor to feature the Scriptures whenever possible.
In that way, we help righthearted ones to see for themselves that we are teaching God’s thoughts, not our own.
How it delights us when someone agrees to read from the Bible and to discuss the value and meaning of God’s Word!
And when such ones accept the invitation to follow Jesus, our joy is boundless.
Following Jesus Means Loving Others
What was an outstanding quality of Jesus, and how can reflecting on it affect us?
The final aspect of Jesus ’ personality that we will discuss is most heartwarming ​ — his love for fellow humans.
The apostle Paul wrote: “The love the Christ has compels us. ”
When we reflect on the love that Jesus has for mankind in general and for us as individuals, our hearts are touched and we feel compelled to follow his example.
16, 17.
In what ways did Jesus show his love for others?
How did Jesus show love for others?
His willingness to surrender his soul in mankind’s behalf was the ultimate expression of his love.
However, during his ministry, Jesus also showed love in other ways.
For instance, he had fellow feeling for those who were suffering.
When he saw Mary and those with her weeping over the death of Lazarus, he was greatly touched by their sorrow.
Although he was about to resurrect Lazarus, Jesus was so moved that he “gave way to tears. ” ​ — John 11: 32 - 35.
Early in Jesus ’ ministry, a leper approached Jesus and said: “If you just want to, you can make me clean. ”
How did Jesus respond?
The record says: “He was moved with pity. ”
He then did something extraordinary.
“He stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him: ‘ I want to. Be made clean. ’
Under the Mosaic Law, lepers were unclean, and Jesus could certainly have healed the man without physical contact.
Yet, as Jesus healed the leper, he allowed him to feel the touch of another human, perhaps for the first time in years.
What a tender act of compassion! ​ — Mark 1: 40 - 42.
How can we demonstrate “fellow feeling ”?
As followers of Christ, we are called on to demonstrate our love by showing “fellow feeling. ”
It may not be easy to understand the feelings of a fellow believer who is suffering from a chronic illness or deep depression ​ — especially if we have never experienced such things ourselves.
Still, Jesus empathized with the sick even though he himself was never sick.
How can we cultivate similar empathy?
By patiently listening as suffering ones open up their hearts to us.
We could also ask ourselves, ‘ If I were in their situation, how would I feel? ’
If we cultivate sensitivity to the feelings of others, we will be better able to “speak consolingly to the depressed souls. ”
Thus we will be following Jesus.
In what ways are we affected by the example of Jesus?
What a thrilling field of study we find in the words and deeds of Jesus Christ!
The more we learn about him, the more we want to be like him ​ — and the more we want to help others to do the same.
By all means, then, let us find delight in following the Messianic King ​ — now and forever!
• How can we show wisdom, as Jesus did?
• In what ways can we demonstrate humility?
• How can we cultivate zeal for the ministry?
• In what ways can we imitate Jesus in showing love for others?

A PUBLICATION THAT HELPS US TO IMITATE CHRIST
During the 2007 district convention program, a 192 - page book entitled “Come Be My Follower ” was released.
This publication is designed to assist Christians to focus on Jesus, especially on his qualities and actions.
After two introductory chapters, the first section provides an overview of Jesus ’ outstanding qualities ​ — his humility, his courage, his wisdom, his obedience, and his endurance.
Following this are sections on Jesus ’ activities as a teacher and as a preacher of the good news and on some of the ways that his great love was manifested.
Throughout the book, information is presented to help a Christian to imitate Jesus.
We are confident that this publication will move all of us to examine ourselves and ask: ‘ Am I really following Jesus? How can I follow him more closely? ’
It will also help “all those who [are] rightly disposed for everlasting life ” to become followers of Christ. ​ — Acts 13: 48.

What will motivate us to be zealous in the ministry?
Find Joy in the Disciple - Making Work
“Go therefore and make disciples. ” ​ — MATT. 28: 19.
1 - 3. (a) How do many feel about the opportunity to conduct Bible studies?
(b) What questions will we consider?
“I HAVE been studying with a family from Pakistan for the past 11 weeks, ” wrote a sister who is serving with a Hindi - speaking group in the United States.
“Needless to say, ” she continues,“ we have become friends. Tears well up in my eyes as I think about this family going back to Pakistan soon.
My tears are prompted not only by the sorrow I feel at the loss of their company but also by the joy I’ve experienced while teaching them about Jehovah. ”
Have you, like this sister, ever experienced the joy that comes from studying the Bible with someone?
Jesus and his first - century disciples found great joy in the disciple - making work.
When the 70 disciples whom Jesus had trained returned with a joyful report, Jesus himself became “overjoyed in the holy spirit. ”
Similarly, many today find great joy in making disciples.
In fact, in 2007, hard - working, happy publishers conducted an average of six and a half million Bible studies each month!
Some publishers, though, have not yet had the pleasure of conducting a Bible study.
Others may not have conducted one in recent years.
What challenges might we face as we endeavor to conduct a Bible study?
How might we overcome those challenges?
And what rewards do we receive when we do all we can to obey Jesus ’ command: “Go therefore and make disciples ”? ​ — Matt. 28: 19.
Challenges That Could Rob Us of Joy
4, 5. (a) How do many people respond in some parts of the world?
(b) What challenges do publishers face in some other places?
In certain parts of the world, people eagerly accept our literature and are keen to study the Bible with us.
One couple from Australia who were temporarily serving in Zambia wrote: “The stories are true. Zambia is a preaching paradise.
Street witnessing is incredible! People approach us, some even asking for particular issues of the magazines. ”
In one recent year, the brothers and sisters in Zambia conducted over 200,000 Bible studies ​ — that is, on average, more than one Bible study per publisher.
In other places, however, publishers may find it difficult to place literature and to conduct Bible studies regularly.
Often, people are not at home when a publisher knocks on their door, while those who are at home might be apathetic about religion.
They may have been raised in a nonreligious household or may be repulsed by the hypocrisy evident in false religion.
Many people have been spiritually injured ​ — skinned and thrown about by false shepherds.
Understandably, such ones may be wary of becoming involved in discussions about the Bible.
With what limitations might some contend?
Although they were at one time very active in the disciple - making work, they are now hampered by ill health or the limitations of old age.
For example, do you feel unqualified to conduct a Bible study?
You may feel as Moses did when Jehovah commissioned him to talk to Pharaoh.
Moses said: “Excuse me, Jehovah, but I am not a fluent speaker, neither since yesterday nor since before that. ”
Closely related to feelings of inadequacy is a fear of failure. We might worry that a person will not become a disciple because we are not the perfect teacher.
Rather than risking that outcome, we might forgo the opportunity to conduct a study.
How can we deal with the challenges just mentioned?
Prepare Your Heart
What motivated Jesus in his ministry?
A first step is to prepare our own heart.
Jesus said: “Out of the heart’s abundance [the] mouth speaks. ”
Jesus was motivated in his ministry by a heartfelt concern for the welfare of others.
For example, when he observed the poor spiritual condition of fellow Jews, “he felt pity for them. ”
He said to his disciples: “The harvest is great...
Beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest. ” ​ — Matt. 9: 36 - 38.
(a) What do we do well to think about?
(b) What can we learn from the comments of one Bible student?
As we engage in the disciple - making work, we do well to think deeply about how much we have benefited because someone took the time to study the Bible with us.
Think, too, of the people we will meet in the ministry and how they will benefit from hearing the message that we bear.
One woman wrote to the branch office of the country in which she lives: “I would like to tell you how much I appreciate the Witnesses who teach me at my home.
I know that sometimes they must get frustrated with me because I have so many questions and I always keep them overtime.
But they are patient with me and eager to share what they have learned.
I thank Jehovah and Jesus that these people have come into my life. ”
On what did Jesus focus, and how can we imitate him? Of course, not everyone responded to Jesus ’ efforts to help them.
Some followed him for a while but then objected to his teachings and “would no longer walk with him. ”
However, Jesus did not allow the unfavorable response of some to make him feel that his message was of no value.
Although much of the seed he sowed bore no fruit, Jesus focused on the good he was doing.
He saw that the fields were white for harvesting and derived great joy from helping in that harvest.
(Read John 4: 35, 36.)
Rather than seeing only the barren ground between the stalks of grain, can we likewise focus on the potential harvest in our assigned territory?
Let us examine how we can maintain such a positive attitude.
Sow With a View to Reaping
10, 11.
What can you do to maintain your joy?
A farmer sows seed with a view to reaping a harvest.
Similarly, we need to preach with a view to starting Bible studies.
What, though, if you regularly spend time in the field ministry but find few people at home or seem unable to contact your return visits again?
This can be frustrating. Should you give up on the door - to - door ministry?
Many people are still contacted first via this time - tested method of preaching.
To maintain your joy, however, can you expand your preaching methods, perhaps to include other ways of reaching people?
For example, have you tried witnessing to people on the street or at their places of employment?
Could you contact people by telephone or obtain the phone numbers of those with whom you have already shared the Kingdom message so that you can stay in touch with them?
By showing perseverance and adaptability in your ministry, you will experience the joy of finding individuals who will favorably respond to the Kingdom message. Coping With Apathy
What might we do if many in our territory seem apathetic?
What if many in your territory are apathetic about religion?
Can you adapt your approach to appeal to their interests?
The apostle Paul wrote to fellow believers in Corinth: “To the Jews I became as a Jew...
To those without law I became as without law, although I am not without law toward God. ”
What was Paul’s motive?
“I have become all things to people of all sorts, ” he said,“ that I might by all means save some. ”
Can we likewise find common ground with those in our territory?
Many nonreligious people want to improve the quality of their family relationships.
They may also be searching for a purpose in life.
Can we present the Kingdom message to such people in a way that will appeal to them?
13, 14.
How may we be able to increase the joy we gain from the disciple - making work?
A growing number of publishers have increased the joy they gain from the disciple - making work, even in areas where the majority of people seem apathetic.
By learning a foreign language.
One couple in their 60 ’ s discovered that thousands of Chinese students and their families were living in the congregation’s assigned territory.
“Because of this, we were encouraged to learn Chinese, ” says the husband.
“Though this meant spending time each day studying the language, ” he continues,“ it resulted in many Bible studies with Chinese people in our area. ”
Even if you are not able to learn a foreign language, you can make good use of the booklet Good News for People of All Nations when you meet those who speak another language.
You can also usually obtain literature in the language of the people whom you meet.
Granted, it requires extra time and effort to communicate with those of another language and culture.
But do not overlook the principle found in God’s Word: “He that sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. ” ​ — 2 Cor. 9: 6.
The Entire Congregation Is Involved
15, 16. (a) Why is the disciple - making work a congregation effort?
(b) What role do elderly ones play?
However, making disciples is not dependent on the efforts of just one individual.
Jesus said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves. ”
And indeed, when Bible students attend meetings, they are often impressed with the loving atmosphere of our gatherings.
One Bible student wrote: “I do so enjoy attending the meetings.
The people are so welcoming! ”
(Read Matthew 10: 35 - 37.)
However, he promised that in the congregation, they would gain numerous spiritual “brothers and sisters and mothers and children. ” ​ — Mark 10: 30.
Our elderly brothers and sisters especially play a vital role in helping Bible students to progress.
Even if some elderly ones are unable to conduct a Bible study themselves, their upbuilding comments at congregation meetings strengthen the faith of all who hear them.
Their record of walking “in the way of righteousness ” adds beauty to the congregation and attracts honesthearted people to God’s organization. ​ — Prov.
16: 31.
Overcoming Our Fears
What can we do to overcome feelings of inadequacy?
What if you struggle with feelings of inadequacy?
Recall that Jehovah helped Moses by providing him with holy spirit and with a partner, his brother, Aaron.
Jesus promised that God’s spirit would back our witnessing work.
Furthermore, Jesus sent workers out to preach in pairs.
Therefore, if you find it a challenge to conduct a Bible study, pray for God’s spirit to give you wisdom and then team up with a preaching companion who can give you confidence and whose experience may be of help to you.
It is faith - strengthening to remember that Jehovah chose to use ordinary people ​ — “the weak things of the world ” — ​ to accomplish this extraordinary work. ​ — 1 Cor.
1: 26 - 29. How can we overcome the fear of failure?
How can we overcome the fear of failure?
We do well to remember that making a disciple is not like making a meal in which success or failure depends primarily on one person ​ — the cook.
Rather, making a disciple involves at least a three - way partnership.
Jehovah does the most important part, drawing the individual to him.
We and others in the congregation do our best to use the art of teaching to help the student progress.
(Read 2 Timothy 2: 15.)
And the student needs to act on what he learns.
If a person discontinues his Bible study, we may be disappointed.
We hope that Bible students make the right choice, but each individual must “render an account for himself to God. ” ​ — Rom.
14: 12. What Are the Rewards?
19 - 21. (a) What benefits do we receive from conducting Bible studies?
(b) How does Jehovah view all who engage in the preaching work?
Conducting Bible studies keeps us focused on seeking first the Kingdom.
It also impresses the truths of God’s Word deeper upon our mind and heart.
A pioneer named Barak explains: “Conducting Bible studies forces you to be a better student of God’s Word.
I find that I must strengthen my personal convictions before I can adequately teach someone else. ”
If you are not conducting a Bible study, does it mean that your service is of no value to God?
Jehovah deeply appreciates our efforts to praise him.
All who engage in the preaching work are “God’s fellow workers. ”
However, conducting a Bible study brings added joy as we see how God makes the seed that we planted grow.
“As you see a Bible student progress, ” says a pioneer named Amy,“ you feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude to Jehovah for allowing you to be used to give that person a wonderful gift ​ — the opportunity of knowing Jehovah and of receiving everlasting life. ”
Doing our best to start and conduct Bible studies will help us to keep focused on serving God now and will strengthen our hope of surviving into the new world.
With Jehovah’s backing, we may also help to save those who listen to us. (Read 1 Timothy 4: 16.)
What a cause for joy that would be!
• What challenges might prevent some from conducting Bible studies?
• What might we do if many in our territory seem apathetic?
• What rewards do we receive from conducting a Bible study?

Do you expand your preaching methods so as to find honesthearted individuals?
Are You a ‘ Steward of God’s Undeserved Kindness ’?
“In brotherly love have tender affection for one another. In showing honor to one another take the lead. ” ​ — ROM. 12: 10.
What assurances do we find in God’s Word?
GOD’S WORD repeatedly assures us that Jehovah will come to our aid when we are discouraged or brokenhearted.
Note, for instance, these comforting words: “Jehovah is giving support to all who are falling, and is raising up all who are bowed down. ”
“He is healing the brokenhearted ones, and is binding up their painful spots. ”
Moreover, our heavenly Father himself states: “I, Jehovah your God, am grasping your right hand, the One saying to you, ‘ Do not be afraid. I myself will help you. ’ ” ​ — Isa.
41: 13.
How does Jehovah provide support to his servants?
How, though, does Jehovah, who dwells in the invisible heavens, ‘ grasp our hand ’? How does he ‘ raise us up when we are bowed down ’ by heartache?
Jehovah God provides such support in various ways.
For example, he gives his people “power beyond what is normal ” by means of his holy spirit.
God’s servants also feel the uplifting power that is exerted by the message found in God’s inspired Word, the Bible.
Is there still another way by which Jehovah fortifies us?
We find an answer in the book of First Peter.
“God’s Undeserved Kindness Expressed in Various Ways ”
(a) What statement about trials is made by the apostle Peter?
(b) What is discussed in the latter part of Peter’s first letter?
Addressing spirit - anointed believers, the apostle Peter writes that they have good reason to be joyful because a rich reward awaits them.
Then he adds: “Though for a little while at present, if it must be, you have been grieved by various trials. ”
Note the word “various. ” It suggests that trials will be varied.
However, Peter does not stop there, leaving his brothers to wonder if they will be able to cope with such a diversity of tests.
Instead, Peter points out that Christians can be sure that Jehovah will help them to cope with each trial they encounter, no matter what its nature may be.
That assurance is given in the latter part of Peter’s letter, where the apostle discusses matters related to “the end of all things. ” ​ — 1 Pet.
4: 7. Why are the words of 1 Peter 4: 10 comforting to us?
Peter states: “In proportion as each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness expressed in various ways. ”
Peter again uses the word “various. ”
He, in effect, says, ‘ Trials come in many different forms, but God’s expressions of undeserved kindness come in many different forms as well. ’
Why is that statement comforting?
It implies that whatever the nature of our trial may be, there will always be an expression of God’s undeserved kindness that will match it.
Did you notice in Peter’s statement, though, just how Jehovah’s undeserved kindness is conveyed to us?
By means of fellow Christians.
“Ministering to One Another ”
(a) What should each Christian do?
(b) What questions arise?
In speaking to all members of the Christian congregation, Peter says: “Above all things, have intense love for one another. ”
He then adds: “In proportion as each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another. ”
We have been placed in charge of something valuable belonging to Jehovah, and we are responsible for distributing it to others.
So, then, with what are we entrusted? Peter says that it is “a gift. ”
What is the gift?
How do we “use it in ministering to one another ”?
What are some of the gifts with which Christians are entrusted?
God’s Word states: “Every good gift and every perfect present is from above. ”
Indeed, all gifts with which Jehovah entrusts his people are expressions of his undeserved kindness.
One outstanding gift Jehovah imparts to us is the holy spirit.
That gift enables us to cultivate such godly qualities as love, goodness, and mildness. Such qualities move us, in turn, to show fellow believers heartfelt affection and give them willing support.
True wisdom and knowledge are also among the good gifts that we acquire with the help of the holy spirit.
In fact, all our energies, abilities, and talents may be viewed as gifts to be used to bring praise and honor to our heavenly Father.
We have the God - given responsibility to use our abilities and qualities as a means of conveying expressions of God’s undeserved kindness to our fellow believers.
“Use It in Ministering ” ​ — How?
(a) What is indicated by the term “in proportion ”?
(b) What questions should we ask ourselves, and why?
Regarding gifts we have received, Peter also states: “In proportion as each one has received a gift, use it. ”
The qualifying term “in proportion ” indicates that qualities and abilities may vary not only in nature but also in extent.
Even so, each one is urged to “use it [that is, any particular gift he has received] in ministering to one another. ”
Moreover, the expression “use it... as fine stewards ” is a command.
Hence, we should ask ourselves: ‘ Do I, indeed, use the gifts with which I am entrusted to fortify my fellow believers? ’
(Compare 1 Timothy 5: 9, 10.)
‘ Or do I use the abilities that I received from Jehovah mainly to benefit myself ​ — perhaps to acquire riches or to attain social status? ’
If we use our gifts “in ministering to one another, ” we will be pleasing Jehovah. ​ — Prov. 19: 17; read Hebrews 13: 16.
8, 9. (a) What are some ways in which Christians worldwide serve in behalf of fellow believers?
(b) How do the brothers and sisters in your congregation help one another?
God’s Word mentions various ways in which first - century Christians ministered to one another. (Read Romans 15: 25, 26; 2 Timothy 1: 16 - 18.)
Similarly today, the command to use one’s gift in behalf of fellow believers is wholeheartedly carried out by true Christians.
Consider some of the ways in which that is being done.
Many brothers spend hours each month preparing meeting parts.
At the meetings, when they convey some of the spiritual gems they have found during their Bible study, their insightful words motivate all in the congregation to endure.
Numerous brothers and sisters are known for their warmth and compassion toward fellow believers.
Some regularly visit those who are depressed and pray with them.
Others thoughtfully write some heartfelt words of encouragement to fellow Christians who are coping with a trial.
Still others kindly help those with physical limitations to attend the congregation meetings.
Thousands of Witnesses share in relief work, helping fellow believers rebuild homes that have been struck by disasters.
The tender affection and practical assistance rendered by such caring brothers and sisters are all manifestations of “God’s undeserved kindness expressed in various ways. ” ​ — Read 1 Peter 4: 11.
Which Is More Important?
(a) Paul was concerned with what two aspects of his service to God?
(b) How do we imitate Paul today?
God’s servants are entrusted not only with a gift to be used in behalf of their fellow believers but also with a message to be shared with their fellow man.
The apostle Paul recognized these two aspects of his service to Jehovah.
He wrote to the congregation in Ephesus regarding “the stewardship of the undeserved kindness of God ” that was given to him for their benefit.
Yet, he also stated: “We have been proved by God as fit to be entrusted with the good news. ”
Like Paul, we too recognize that we are entrusted with the assignment of serving as preachers of God’s Kingdom.
By sharing zealously in the preaching work, we strive to imitate the example that Paul set as an untiring proclaimer of the good news.
We know that preaching the Kingdom message can save lives. At the same time, however, we also strive to imitate Paul by looking for opportunities to “impart some spiritual gift ” to fellow believers. ​ — Read Romans 1: 11, 12; 10: 13 - 15.
How should we view our assignments to preach and to build up our brothers?
Asking a question like that is somewhat similar to asking about a bird, Which of his two wings is more important?
The answer is obvious. A bird needs to use both wings in order to fly properly.
Similarly, we need to share in both aspects of our service to God in order to be complete as Christians.
Thus, instead of regarding our assignments to preach the good news and to build up fellow believers as unrelated, we view them just as the apostles Peter and Paul did ​ — as responsibilities that complement each other.
In what way?
How do we serve as an instrument in Jehovah’s hand?
As evangelizers, we employ whatever teaching skills we may have in trying to touch the hearts of our fellow men with the uplifting message of God’s Kingdom.
In that way, we hope to help them to become Christ’s disciples.
However, we also use whatever abilities and other gifts we may have in trying to warm the hearts of our fellow believers with uplifting words and helpful deeds ​ — expressions of God’s undeserved kindness.
In that way, we hope to help them to remain Christ’s disciples.
6: 10.
“Have Tender Affection for One Another ”
What would happen if we held back in “ministering to one another ”?
Paul urged his fellow believers: “In brotherly love have tender affection for one another. In showing honor to one another take the lead. ”
Indeed, having affection for our brothers impels us to serve wholeheartedly as stewards of God’s undeserved kindness.
We realize that if Satan succeeded in holding us back from “ministering to one another, ” he would weaken our unity.
In turn, a lack of unity would lead to a lack of zeal in the preaching work.
Satan well knows that he needs to harm only one of our wings, so to speak, in order to ground us.
Who benefit from our “ministering to one another ”?
Give an example.
“Ministering to one another ” benefits not only those who receive God’s undeserved kindness but also those who convey it.
Take, for example, Ryan and Roni, a couple in Illinois, U.S.A.
When they learned that Hurricane Katrina had destroyed hundreds of homes of fellow Witnesses, brotherly love moved them to quit their jobs, give up their apartment, buy a secondhand trailer, fix it up, and travel 900 miles [1,400 km] to Louisiana. There they lived for over a year while giving of their time, strength, and resources to help their brothers.
“Sharing in relief work drew me closer to God, ” says Ryan, age 29.
“I saw how Jehovah takes care of his people. ”
Ryan adds: “Working with older brothers taught me much about how to care for the brothers.
I also learned that there is much for us younger ones to do in Jehovah’s organization. ” Roni, age 25, notes: “I am grateful for having had a share in helping others.
I feel happier than I have ever felt in my life.
I know that in years to come, I will continue to reap benefits from this wonderful experience. ”
What good reasons do we have to continue to serve as stewards of God’s undeserved kindness?
Indeed, obeying God’s commands to preach the good news and to build up fellow believers brings blessings to all.
The ones we help are spiritually strengthened, while we experience the heartfelt joy that only giving can bring.
The congregation as a whole grows in warmth as each member takes a loving interest in others.
Furthermore, the love and affection that we show for one another clearly identifies us as true Christians.
Jesus said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves. ”
Above all, honor goes to our caring Father, Jehovah, as his desire to strengthen those in need is reflected in his earthly servants.
What good reasons we have, therefore, to use our gift “in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness ”!
Will you continue to do so? ​ — Read Hebrews 6: 10.

Jehovah’s Approved Servant
“Look! My servant,... whom my soul has approved! ” ​ — ISA.
42: 1.
What are Jehovah’s people encouraged to do, particularly as the Memorial approaches, and why?
AS THE time to commemorate Christ’s death approaches, God’s people do well to follow the apostle Paul’s counsel to “look intently at the Chief Agent and Perfecter of our faith, Jesus. ”
Paul added: “Indeed, consider closely the one who has endured such contrary talk by sinners against their own interests, that you may not get tired and give out in your souls. ”
Looking closely at Christ’s course of faithfulness, which culminated in his sacrifice, will help both anointed Christians and their other sheep companions to continue serving Jehovah faithfully and to avoid ‘ giving out in their souls. ’ ​ — Compare Galatians 6: 9.
What can we learn from the prophecies of Isaiah that relate to God’s Son?
Through the prophet Isaiah, Jehovah inspired a series of prophecies directly related to his Son.
These prophecies will help us to “look intently at the Chief Agent and Perfecter of our faith, ” Christ Jesus.
* They shed light on his personality, his sufferings, and his exaltation as our King and Redeemer.
They will enhance our understanding of the Memorial, which we will be commemorating this year on Thursday, April 9, after sundown.
The Servant Identified
3, 4. (a) In the book of Isaiah, what does the word “servant ” designate?
(b) How does the Bible itself identify the Servant mentioned in Isaiah chapters 42, 49, 50, 52, and 53?
The word “servant ” occurs many times in the book of Isaiah.
It occasionally designates the prophet himself.
Sometimes it is applied to the whole nation of Israel, or Jacob.
But what of the outstanding prophecies regarding the Servant recorded in Isaiah chapters 42, 49, 50, 52, and 53?
The Christian Greek Scriptures leave us in no doubt as to the identity of the Servant of Jehovah described in those chapters.
Interestingly, the Ethiopian official mentioned in the book of Acts was reading one of these prophecies when Philip the evangelizer was directed by the spirit to approach him.
The official, having read the Bible passage that we now find at Isaiah 53: 7, 8, asked Philip: “I beg you, About whom does the prophet say this?
About himself or about some other man? ”
Philip lost no time in explaining that Isaiah spoke about the Messiah, Jesus. ​ — Acts 8: 26 - 35.
While Jesus was yet a babe, a righteous man named Simeon declared under the power of the holy spirit that “the young child Jesus ” would become“ a light for removing the veil from the nations, ” as foretold at Isaiah 42: 6 and 49: 6.
Furthermore, the humiliating treatment meted out to Jesus on the night of his trial was foretold in the prophecy of Isaiah 50: 6 - 9. After Pentecost 33 C.E., the apostle Peter clearly identified Jesus as Jehovah’s “Servant. ”
What can we learn from these Messianic prophecies?
Jehovah Trains His Servant
What training did the Servant receive?
One of Isaiah’s prophecies about God’s Servant sheds light on the intimate relationship between Jehovah and his firstborn Son during the Son’s prehuman existence. (Read Isaiah 50: 4 - 9.)
The Servant himself reveals that Jehovah continually trained him, saying: “He awakens my ear to hear like the taught ones [“ disciples, ” ftn.]. ”
During all that time, Jehovah’s Servant listened to his Father and learned from him, becoming a submissive disciple.
What a unique privilege to be taught by the Creator of the universe!
How did the Servant indicate his perfect submission to his Father?
In this prophecy, the Servant speaks of his Father as “the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. ”
This shows that the Servant had learned the fundamental truth of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty.
Indicating his perfect submission to his Father, he stated: “The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has opened my ear, and I, for my part, was not rebellious.
I did not turn in the opposite direction. ” He “came to be beside [Jehovah] as a master worker ” in the creation of the material universe and man. This“ master worker ” was “glad before [Jehovah] all the time, being glad at the productive land of his earth, and the things [God’s Son] was fond of were with the sons of men. ” ​ — Prov.
8: 22 - 31.
What shows that the Servant had confidence in his Father’s support during his trials?
This training received by the Servant and his fondness for mankind stood him in good stead when he came to earth and faced severe opposition.
He continued to delight to do his Father’s will, even in the face of bitter persecution.
Throughout his trials on earth, Jesus was confident of his Father’s approval and support.
As was foretold in Isaiah’s prophecy, Jesus was able to say: “The One declaring me righteous is near.
Who can contend with me?...
The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself will help me. ”
Jehovah certainly did help his faithful Servant throughout his ministry on earth, as another prophecy of Isaiah shows.
The Servant’s Ministry on Earth
What proves that Jesus was Jehovah’s “chosen one, ” as foretold at Isaiah 42: 1?
The Bible record tells what happened when Jesus was baptized in 29 C.E.: “The holy spirit... came down upon him, and a voice came out of heaven: ‘ You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you. ’ ”
Jehovah thus clearly identified his “chosen one, ” mentioned in Isaiah’s prophecy.
(Read Isaiah 42: 1 - 7.)
During his earthly ministry, Jesus fulfilled this prophecy in a remarkable way.
In his Gospel account, Matthew quoted the words found at Isaiah 42: 1 - 4 and applied them to Jesus. ​ — Matt.
12: 15 - 21. 9, 10. (a) How did Jesus fulfill Isaiah 42: 3 during his ministry?
(b) How did Christ “bring forth justice ” while on earth, and when is it that he“ sets justice in the earth ”?
The common people among the Jews were despised by the Jewish religious leaders.
The people were treated roughly and could be compared to ‘ crushed reeds ’ or ‘ flaxen wicks ’ when they are at their last flicker.
Jesus, however, showed compassion for the poor and afflicted.
He offered such ones a kind invitation, saying: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you. ”
Furthermore, Jesus ‘ brought forth justice ’ by teaching Jehovah’s standards of right and wrong.
He further showed that God’s Law needed to be applied with reasonableness and mercy.
Jesus also displayed justice by preaching without prejudice to both rich and poor. ​ — Matt.
11: 5; Luke 18: 18 - 23.
Isaiah’s prophecy also predicts that Jehovah’s “chosen one ”“ sets justice in the earth. ”
This he will shortly do when as King of the Messianic Kingdom, he destroys all political kingdoms and replaces them with his own righteous rule.
He will usher in a new world, where “righteousness is to dwell. ” ​ — 2 Pet. 3: 13; Dan.
2: 44. “A Light ” and“ a Covenant ”
In what sense was Jesus “a light of the nations ” in the first century, and how is he such up to the present day?
In fulfillment of Isaiah 42: 6, Jesus did indeed prove to be “a light of the nations. ”
During his earthly ministry, he brought spiritual light primarily to the Jews.
But Jesus stated: “I am the light of the world. ”
He became a light both to the Jews and to the nations not only by bringing spiritual enlightenment but also by offering his perfect human life as a ransom for all mankind.
After his resurrection, he commissioned his disciples to be witnesses of him “to the most distant part of the earth. ”
During their ministry, Paul and Barnabas quoted the expression “light of the nations ” and applied it to the preaching work they were accomplishing among non - Jews.
That work is still being pursued as Jesus ’ anointed brothers on earth and their companions spread spiritual light and help people to put faith in Jesus, the “light of the nations. ”
How has Jehovah given his Servant “as a covenant of the people ”?
In that same prophecy, Jehovah told his chosen Servant: “I shall safeguard you and give you as a covenant of the people. ”
Satan put forth persistent efforts to destroy Jesus and prevent Jesus from completing his ministry on earth, but Jehovah safeguarded him until the appointed time for him to die.
Then Jehovah resurrected Jesus and gave him as “a covenant, ” or pledge, to people on earth.
That solemn promise provided assurance that God’s faithful Servant would continue as “a light of the nations, ” liberating those in spiritual darkness. ​ — Read Isaiah 49: 8, 9.
In what way did Jesus deliver “those sitting in darkness ” during his earthly ministry, and how does he continue to do so?
In harmony with this pledge, Jehovah’s chosen Servant would “open the blind eyes, ”“ bring forth out of the dungeon the prisoner, ” and deliver “those sitting in darkness. ”
During his earthly ministry, Jesus did this by exposing false religious traditions and preaching the good news of the Kingdom.
He thus delivered from spiritual bondage Jews who became his disciples.
In a similar way, Jesus has brought spiritual deliverance to millions of non - Jews.
He has commissioned his followers to “go... and make disciples of people of all the nations, ” promising that he will be with his followers“ until the conclusion of the system of things. ”
From his heavenly position, Christ Jesus is overseeing the global preaching work.
Jehovah Elevated the “Servant ”
14, 15.
Why and how did Jehovah elevate his Servant?
In yet another prophecy regarding his Messianic Servant, Jehovah states: “Look!
My servant will act with insight.
He will be in high station and will certainly be elevated and exalted very much. ”
In view of his Son’s loyal submission to His sovereignty and his faithfulness under the most extreme test, Jehovah elevated him.
The apostle Peter wrote of Jesus: “He is at God’s right hand, for he went his way to heaven; and angels and authorities and powers were made subject to him. ”
Similarly, the apostle Paul wrote: “He humbled himself and became obedient as far as death, yes, death on a torture stake.
For this very reason also God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name, so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground, and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. ” ​ — Phil. 2: 8 - 11.
How was Jesus “exalted very much ” in 1914, and what has he accomplished since then?
In 1914, Jehovah elevated Jesus even further.
He was “exalted very much ” when Jehovah enthroned him as King of the Messianic Kingdom.
Since then, Christ has gone forth “subduing in the midst of [his] enemies. ”
He first subdued Satan and his demons, hurling them down to the vicinity of the earth.
Then, acting as the Greater Cyrus, Christ delivered the remnant of his anointed brothers on earth from the grip of “Babylon the Great. ”
He has headed a worldwide preaching work that has resulted in the ingathering of “the remaining ones ” of his spiritual brothers and then of millions of“ other sheep, ” the loyal companions of the “little flock. ” ​ — Rev. 12: 17; John 10: 16; Luke 12: 32.
What have we learned thus far by studying Isaiah’s prophecies regarding the “servant ”?
The study of these remarkable prophecies in the book of Isaiah has surely increased our appreciation for our King and Redeemer, Christ Jesus.
His filial submission during his earthly ministry reflected the training he received at his Father’s side before coming to earth.
He has proved himself to be the “light of the nations ” by his own ministry and by the preaching work he has overseen up until this very day.
As we shall next see, another prophecy regarding the Messianic Servant reveals that he would suffer and pour out his life for our benefit, matters we should “consider closely ” as the Memorial of his death approaches. ​ — Heb.
12: 2, 3.
You can find these prophecies at Isaiah 42: 1 - 7; 49: 1 - 12; 50: 4 - 9; and 52: 13 – 53: 12.
For a discussion of the prophecy at Isaiah 49: 1 - 12, see Isaiah’s Prophecy ​ — Light for All Mankind II, pages 136 - 145.

Jehovah’s Servant ​ — “Pierced for Our Transgression ”
“He was being pierced for our transgression; he was being crushed for our errors....
Because of his wounds there has been a healing for us. ” ​ — ISA.
53: 5.
What should we keep in mind when we observe the Memorial, and what prophecy will help us to do so?
WE OBSERVE the Memorial to commemorate Christ’s death and to remember all that his death and resurrection have accomplished.
The Memorial reminds us of the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty, the sanctification of his name, and the fulfillment of his purpose, including the salvation of mankind.
Perhaps no other prophecy in the Bible better depicts Christ’s sacrifice and what it has accomplished than the one recorded at Isaiah 53: 3 - 12.
Isaiah foretold the Servant’s sufferings and provided specific details about Christ’s death and about the blessings his death would result in for his anointed brothers and his “other sheep. ” ​ — John 10: 16.
Of what is Isaiah’s prophecy a proof, and what effect will it have on us?
Seven centuries before Jesus ’ birth on earth, Jehovah inspired Isaiah to prophesy that His chosen Servant would be faithful even when tested to the limit.
This very fact is proof of Jehovah’s absolute confidence in his Son’s loyalty.
As we examine this prophecy, our hearts will be warmed and our faith will be strengthened.
“Despised ” and Held“ as of No Account ”
Why should the Jews have welcomed Jesus, but how did they receive him?
Read Isaiah 53: 3.
Just imagine what it must have meant for the only - begotten Son of God to forgo the joy of serving at his Father’s side and come to earth to give his life in sacrifice to save mankind from sin and death!
His sacrifice was to accomplish real forgiveness of sins, which the offering of animal sacrifices under the Mosaic Law only foreshadowed.
Should he not have been welcomed and honored, at least by the Jews, who were awaiting the promised Messiah?
Instead, the Christ was “despised ” by the Jews, and they“ held him as of no account, ” as Isaiah had prophesied.
The apostle John wrote: “He came to his own home, but his own people did not take him in. ”
The apostle Peter told the Jews: “The God of our forefathers... has glorified his Servant, Jesus, whom you, for your part, delivered up and disowned before Pilate’s face, when he had decided to release him.
Yes, you disowned that holy and righteous one. ” ​ — Acts 3: 13, 14.
How did Jesus become acquainted with sickness?
Isaiah also prophesied that Jesus was meant to have “acquaintance with sickness. ”
During his ministry, Jesus certainly got tired on occasion, but there is no indication that he got sick.
He did, however, become acquainted with the sicknesses of those to whom he preached.
He felt pity for them and healed many.
Jesus thus fulfilled the prophecy that states: “Truly our sicknesses were what he himself carried; and as for our pains, he bore them. ” ​ — Isa. 53: 4a; Matt.
8: 16, 17.
As if “Stricken by God ”
How did many of the Jews view Jesus ’ death, and why did this add to his suffering?
Read Isaiah 53: 4b.
Many of Jesus ’ contemporaries did not understand the reason for his suffering and death.
They believed that God was punishing him, as if plaguing him with a loathsome disease.
The Jews charged Jesus with blasphemy.
Of course, Jesus was neither a sinner nor a blasphemer.
But in view of his great love for his Father, the very idea that he was to die accused of blasphemy must have added to his suffering as Jehovah’s Servant.
Nevertheless, he was willing to submit to Jehovah’s will. ​ — Matt. 26: 39.
6, 7.
In what sense did Jehovah ‘ crush ’ his faithful Servant, and why did this bring God “delight ”?
It is one thing for Isaiah’s prophecy to state that others would account Christ as “stricken by God ” but quite another for the prophecy to foretell:“ Jehovah himself took delight in crushing him. ”
Since Jehovah had also stated: “Look!
My servant,... my chosen one, whom my soul has approved, ” how could Jehovah possibly take “delight in crushing him ”?
In what sense can it be said that this brought Jehovah joy?
To understand this part of the prophecy, we should remember that in challenging Jehovah’s sovereignty, Satan cast doubt on the loyalty of all of God’s servants in heaven and on earth.
Jesus, by remaining faithful to death, provided the perfect answer to Satan’s challenge.
Thus, while Jehovah permitted Christ to be killed by his enemies, there can be no doubt that Jehovah suffered when he saw his chosen Servant being put to death. However, observing his Son’s absolute faithfulness brought Jehovah much delight.
Furthermore, knowing the benefits that his Son’s death would bring to repentant humans brought Jehovah great joy. ​ — Luke 15: 7.
“Pierced for Our Transgression ”
8, 9. (a) How was Jesus “pierced for our transgression ”?
(b) How did Peter confirm this?
Read Isaiah 53: 6.
Like lost sheep, sinful humans have wandered about, seeking deliverance from the sickness and death inherited from Adam.
Being imperfect, not one of Adam’s descendants could buy back what Adam had forfeited.
In his great love, however, “Jehovah himself has caused the error of us all to meet up with that one, ” his dear Son and chosen Servant.
By consenting to be “pierced for our transgression ” and“ crushed for our errors, ” Christ carried our sins upon the stake and died in our place.
The apostle Peter wrote: “To this course you were called, because even Christ suffered for you, leaving you a model for you to follow his steps closely.
He himself bore our sins in his own body upon the stake, in order that we might be done with sins and live to righteousness. ”
Then, quoting from Isaiah’s prophecy, Peter added: “And ‘ by his stripes you were healed. ’ ”
This opened the way for sinners to become reconciled to God, as Peter further stated: “Christ died once for all time concerning sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, that he might lead you to God. ” ​ — 1 Pet. 3: 18.
“Brought Just Like a Lamb to the Slaughtering ”
(a) How did John the Baptizer describe Jesus?
(b) Why did John’s words prove to be fitting?
Read Isaiah 53: 7, 8.
When John the Baptizer saw Jesus approaching, he exclaimed: “See, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world! ”
In speaking of Jesus as a Lamb, John may have had in mind the words of Isaiah: “He was being brought just like a lamb to the slaughtering. ”
Interestingly, on the night when Jesus instituted the Memorial of his death, he gave a cup of wine to the 11 faithful apostles and stated: “This means my ‘ blood of the covenant, ’ which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins. ” ​ — Matt.
26: 28.
11, 12. (a) What does Isaac’s willingness to be offered up illustrate about Christ’s sacrifice?
(b) What should we keep in mind about the Greater Abraham, Jehovah, when we observe the Memorial?
Like Isaac of old, Jesus was willing to be offered up as a sacrifice on the altar of Jehovah’s will for him.
While Isaac willingly consented to being sacrificed, it was Abraham who attempted to offer the sacrifice.
Similarly, Jesus willingly accepted that he was to die, but it was Jehovah who was the Author of the ransom arrangement.
The sacrifice of his Son was an expression of God’s deep love for mankind.
Jesus himself stated: “God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life. ”
The apostle Paul wrote: “God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. ”
Therefore, while honoring Christ by commemorating his death, we should never forget that the one who made the sacrificial arrangement possible was the Greater Abraham, Jehovah.
We observe the Memorial to his praise.
The Servant Brings “a Righteous Standing to Many ”
13, 14.
How has Jehovah’s Servant brought “a righteous standing to many ”?
Read Isaiah 53: 11, 12.
Of his chosen Servant, Jehovah stated: “The righteous one, my servant, will bring a righteous standing to many people. ”
In what way?
The end of verse 12 gives us a clue to the answer. “And for the transgressors he [the Servant] proceeded to interpose. ”
All of Adam’s descendants are born sinners, “transgressors, ” and therefore receive“ the wages sin pays, ” namely, death.
Reconciliation between Jehovah and sinful man is necessary.
Chapter 53 of Isaiah’s prophecy describes beautifully how Jesus ‘ interposed, ’ or interceded, on behalf of sinful mankind, stating: “The chastisement meant for our peace was upon him, and because of his wounds there has been a healing for us. ” ​ — Isa.
53: 5.
By taking our sins upon himself and dying for us, Christ brought “a righteous standing to many people. ”
Paul wrote: “God saw good for all fullness to dwell in him [Christ], and through him to reconcile again to himself all other things by making peace through the blood he shed on the torture stake, no matter whether they are the things upon the earth or the things in the heavens. ” ​ — Col.
1: 19, 20. (a) Who are “the things in the heavens ” mentioned by Paul?
(b) Who alone are entitled to partake of the Memorial emblems, and why?
“The things in the heavens ” that are reconciled to Jehovah by means of Christ’s shed blood are the anointed Christians, called to reign with Christ in the heavens.
Christians who are “partakers of the heavenly calling ” are declared“ righteous for life. ”
Jehovah then begets them as spiritual sons.
The holy spirit bears witness to them that they are “joint heirs with Christ, ” called to become kings and priests in his heavenly Kingdom.
They become part of spiritual Israel, “the Israel of God, ” and they are taken into the“ new covenant. ”
As members of the new covenant, they are entitled to partake of the Memorial emblems, including the cup of red wine, of which Jesus stated: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf. ” ​ — Luke 22: 20.
What are “the things upon the earth, ” and in what way are they given a righteous standing before Jehovah?
“The things upon the earth ” are Christ’s other sheep, who have the hope of living forever on earth.
To these also Jehovah’s chosen Servant brings a righteous standing before Jehovah.
Because they have faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice and thus “have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, ” Jehovah declares them righteous, not as spiritual sons, but as his friends, giving them the wonderful prospect of surviving“ the great tribulation. ”
Not being in the new covenant and therefore not having the hope of living in heaven, these other sheep do not partake of the Memorial emblems but attend as respectful observers.
All Thanks to Jehovah and His Approved Servant!
How has a study of the prophecies in Isaiah that center on the Servant helped us to prepare our minds for the Memorial?
The examination of the prophecies in Isaiah that center on the Servant has been a fine way to prepare our minds for the Memorial of Christ’s death.
It has enabled us to “look intently at the Chief Agent and Perfecter of our faith. ”
We have learned that God’s Son is not rebellious.
Unlike Satan, he delights in being taught by Jehovah, recognizing him as the Sovereign Lord.
We have seen that during Jesus ’ earthly ministry, he showed compassion for the people to whom he preached, healing many of them both physically and spiritually.
He thus demonstrated what he will do as Messianic King in the new system of things when “he sets justice in the earth. ”
The zeal he showed in preaching the Kingdom, as “a light of the nations, ” is a reminder to his followers to preach the good news zealously throughout the earth. ​ — Isa.
42: 6.
Why does Isaiah’s prophecy fill our hearts with gratitude to Jehovah and to his faithful Servant?
Isaiah’s prophecy also enhances our understanding of the great sacrifice Jehovah made when he sent his dear Son to earth to suffer and die for us.
Jehovah delighted, not in seeing his Son suffer, but in observing Jesus ’ absolute faithfulness to the very death.
We should share Jehovah’s delight, recognizing all that Jesus did to prove Satan a liar and sanctify Jehovah’s name, thus vindicating the rightfulness of His sovereignty.
In addition, Christ took our sins upon himself and died in our behalf.
In that way, he made it possible for the little flock of his anointed brothers and for the other sheep to have a righteous standing before Jehovah.
As we gather together for the Memorial, may our hearts be filled with gratitude to Jehovah and to his faithful Servant.
• In what sense did Jehovah ‘ take delight ’ in his Son’s being ‘ crushed ’?
• How was Jesus “pierced for our transgression ”?
• How did the Servant “bring a righteous standing to many ”?
• How has a study of the prophecies regarding the Servant prepared your mind and heart for the Memorial?

“This Is the Way. Walk in It ”
The Story of Emilia Pederson
As told by Ruth E.
MY MOTHER, Emilia Pederson, was born in 1878.
Although she became a schoolteacher, she really wanted to use her life helping people draw close to God.
Evidence of Mother’s desire was a large trunk sitting in our home in the small town of Jasper, Minnesota, U.S.A.
She had obtained it to transport her belongings to China, where she wanted to serve as a missionary.
However, when her mother died, she had to forgo her plans and stay at home to care for her younger siblings.
In 1907 she married Theodore Holien.
I was born on December 2, 1925 ​ — the last of seven children.
Mother had Bible questions to which she earnestly sought answers.
One question was regarding the teaching that hell is a place of fiery torment for the wicked. She asked a visiting supervisor of the Lutheran Church where she could find Bible support for this teaching.
He, in effect, told her that it does not matter what the Bible says ​ — a hell of fiery torment needs to be taught.
Her Spiritual Hunger Satisfied
Shortly after 1900, Mother’s sister, Emma, went to Northfield, Minnesota, to study music.
She stayed at the home of Milius Christianson, her teacher, whose wife was a Bible Student, as Jehovah’s Witnesses were then called.
Emma mentioned that she had a sister who was a devout Bible reader. Before long, Mrs.
Christianson wrote Mother a letter with answers to her Bible questions.
One day, a Bible Student named Lora Oathout came by train from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to preach in Jasper.
Mom studied the Bible literature she received, and in 1915, she began sharing Bible truths with others, distributing the literature that Lora provided.
In 1916, Mom heard that Charles Taze Russell would be at a convention in Sioux City, Iowa. She wanted to attend.
By this time, Mom had five children, and Marvin, the youngest, was only five months old.
Nevertheless, children in tow, she made the train journey of some 100 miles [160 km] to Sioux City to attend the convention.
She heard Brother Russell’s talks, saw the “Photo - Drama of Creation, ” and was baptized.
Upon returning home, she wrote an article about the convention, which was published in the Jasper Journal.
In 1922, Mom was among the some 18,000 who attended the convention at Cedar Point, Ohio.
After that convention, she never let up in advertising God’s Kingdom.
In effect, she would urge us to heed the admonition: “This is the way. Walk in it. ” ​ — Isa.
30: 21.
Fruitage of the Kingdom Ministry
In the early 1920 ’ s, my parents moved into a house outside Jasper.
Dad had a successful business and a big family to support.
He did not study the Bible as much as Mom did, but he wholeheartedly supported the preaching work and opened our home to traveling ministers, then known as pilgrims.
Often, when one of the traveling brothers gave a talk in our home, a hundred or so attended ​ — packed into our living room, dining room, and bedroom.
When I was about seven years old, my aunt Lettie phoned and said that her neighbors, Ed Larson and his wife, wanted to study the Bible.
They readily accepted Bible truths and later invited another neighbor, Martha Van Daalen, a mother of eight children, to join in the study.
Martha and her whole family also became Bible Students.
About that time, Gordon Kammerud, a young man who lived a few miles away from us, began to work with Dad.
Gordon had been warned: “Be careful with the boss’s daughters. They have a strange religion. ”
However, Gordon began studying the Bible and was soon convinced that he had found the truth.
Three months later, he was baptized.
His parents also became believers, and our families ​ — the Holiens, the Kammeruds, and the Van Daalens — ​ became close friends.
Strengthened by Conventions
Mom had been so encouraged by the Cedar Point convention that she never wanted to miss another convention.
So my early memories are of making long trips to attend those gatherings. The one in Columbus, Ohio, in 1931 was momentous because it was then that the name Jehovah’s Witnesses was adopted.
I also well remember the convention in Washington, D.C., in 1935, where a historic talk identified the “great multitude, ” or the“ great crowd, ” spoken of in Revelation.
My sisters Lilian and Eunice were among the more than 800 who were baptized there.
Our family traveled to conventions in Columbus, Ohio, in 1937; Seattle, Washington, in 1938; and New York City in 1939.
The Van Daalen and Kammerud families and others accompanied us, and we camped along the way.
Eunice married Leo Van Daalen in 1940, and they became pioneers.
That same year, Lilian married Gordon Kammerud, and they too became pioneers.
The convention in 1941 held in St. Louis, Missouri, was special.
There, thousands of young people received the book Children.
That convention was a turning point for me.
Shortly afterward, on September 1, 1941, along with my brother Marvin and his wife, Joyce, I became a pioneer. I was 15.
In our farming community, it was difficult for all the brothers to attend the conventions because these were often held during harvesttime.
So after the conventions, we had convention reviews in our backyard for the benefit of those who had not been able to attend.
These were happy gatherings.
Gilead and Foreign Assignments
In February 1943, Gilead School was established for the training of pioneers for missionary service.
The first class included six members of the Van Daalen family ​ — the brothers Emil, Arthur, Homer, and Leo; their cousin Donald; and Leo’s wife, my sister Eunice.
We said our farewells with mixed emotions, since we did not know when we would see them again.
After graduation, all six were assigned to Puerto Rico, where there were fewer than a dozen Witnesses at the time.
A year later, Lilian and Gordon as well as Marvin and Joyce attended the third class of Gilead. They too were sent to Puerto Rico. Then, in September 1944, at the age of 18, I attended Gilead’s fourth class.
After graduating in February 1945, I joined my siblings in Puerto Rico.
What an interesting world opened up to me! Although learning Spanish was a challenge, soon some of us were conducting more than 20 Bible studies each.
Jehovah blessed the work. Today, there are about 25,000 Witnesses in Puerto Rico!
Tragedies Strike Our Family
Leo and Eunice remained in Puerto Rico after the birth of their son, Mark, in 1950.
In 1952 they planned to take a vacation to visit relatives back home.
On April 11, they left by airplane. Tragically, shortly after takeoff, the plane crashed into the ocean.
Leo and Eunice died. Two - year - old Mark was found floating in the ocean.
He was tossed into a life raft by a survivor and was given artificial respiration ​ — and he lived.
Five years later, on March 7, 1957, Mom and Dad were driving to the Kingdom Hall when they had a flat tire.
While changing the tire by the side of the road, Dad was hit by a passing car and died instantly.
Some 600 attended the funeral talk, and a fine witness was given to the community, where Father was well - respected.
New Assignments
Just before Dad’s death, I had received an assignment to serve in Argentina.
In August 1957, I arrived in the city of Mendoza in the foothills of the Andes Mountains. In 1958, George Pappas, a graduate of the 30th class of Gilead, was assigned to Argentina.
George and I became good friends, and we were married in April 1960.
In 1961, Mom died at the age of 83.
She had walked faithfully in the way of true worship and had helped many, many others to do the same.
For ten years George and I served together with other missionaries in various missionary homes.
Then we spent seven years in the circuit work. In 1975 we returned to the United States to assist family members who were ill. In 1980 my husband was invited to do circuit work in the Spanish - language field.
There were then about 600 Spanish - speaking congregations in the United States.
For 26 years, we visited many of them and saw the number of congregations increase to well over 3,000.
They Have Walked in “the Way ”
Mom also had the joy of seeing younger members of her family take up the full - time ministry.
For instance, Carol, a daughter of my eldest sister, Ester, began pioneering in 1953.
She married Dennis Trumbore, and they have shared in the full - time ministry ever since.
Ester’s other daughter, Lois, married Wendell Jensen.
They attended the 41st class of Gilead and served for 15 years as missionaries in Nigeria.
Mark, whose parents died in the plane crash, was adopted and raised by Leo’s sister, Ruth La Londe, and her husband, Curtiss.
Mark and his wife, Lavonne, pioneered for years and reared their four children in “the way. ” ​ — Isa.
30: 21.
Orlen, my only sibling still alive, is in his mid - 90 ’ s. He is still faithfully serving Jehovah.
George and I joyfully continue in the full - time ministry.
What Mom Left
I now have one of Mom’s prized possessions ​ — her desk. It was a wedding gift to her from my father.
In one of the drawers is her old scrapbook, which contains letters and published newspaper articles that she wrote and that gave a fine Kingdom witness.
Some of these date back to the early 1900 ’ s.
The desk also holds treasured letters from Mom’s missionary children.
How I enjoy reading them over and over again!
And her letters to us were always so encouraging, filled with positive thoughts.
Mom never fulfilled her desire to be a missionary. However, she had a zeal for missionary service that moved the hearts of others for generations after her.
How I look forward to a big family reunion with Mom and Dad in the paradise earth! ​ — Rev. 21: 3, 4.
See The Watchtower, June 15, 1983, pages 27 - 30, for the life story of Emil H. Van Daalen.

Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
Highlights From the Book of Revelation ​ — I
WHILE imprisoned on the island of Patmos, the aged apostle John receives a series of 16 visions.
He beholds in them what Jehovah God and Jesus Christ accomplish during the Lord’s day ​ — the period that stretches from the establishment of God’s Kingdom in 1914 to the end of Christ’s Millennial Reign.
The book of Revelation, written by John in about the year 96 C.E., is an exciting account of these visions.
Let us now consider highlights of Revelation 1: 1 – 12: 17, covering the first seven visions received by John.
These visions are of interest to us because they pertain to what is happening on the world scene now and show how Jehovah will take action in the near future.
Those who read the account of these visions with faith are indeed comforted and encouraged. ​ — Heb. 4: 12.
“THE LAMB ” OPENS SIX OF THE SEVEN SEALS
1: 1 – 7: 17)
First, John beholds the glorified Jesus Christ and receives a series of messages that he is to ‘ write in a scroll and send to the seven congregations. ’
The vision of a throne in its position in heaven follows.
In the right hand of the One seated upon the throne is a scroll sealed with seven seals.
The one deemed “worthy to open the scroll ” is none other than“ the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, ” or “a lamb... having seven horns and seven eyes. ” ​ — Rev. 4: 2; 5: 1, 2, 5, 6.
The third vision reveals what happens as “the Lamb ” opens the first six seals, one after another.
With the opening of the sixth seal, a great earthquake occurs and the great day of wrath arrives.
But the next vision shows ‘ four angels holding tight the four winds of the earth ’ until the sealing of the 144,000 is completed.
“A great crowd ” of those not sealed is seen“ standing before the throne and before the Lamb. ” ​ — Rev.
7: 1, 9. Scriptural Questions Answered:
1: 4; 3: 1; 4: 5; 5: 6 ​ — What is indicated by the expression “the seven spirits ”?
The number seven signifies completeness from God’s standpoint.
Thus, the message to “the seven congregations ” ultimately applies to all of God’s people gathered together in more than 100,000 congregations earth wide.
Since holy spirit is given according to what its operation needs to accomplish, the expression “the seven spirits ” denotes the fullness of its operation in giving understanding and bringing blessings to those who pay attention to the prophecy.
The book of Revelation seems to progress on the basis of a series of sevens.
The number seven here represents completeness, and indeed, the book deals with bringing “to a finish, ” or completion,“ the sacred secret of God. ” ​ — Rev. 10: 7.
1: 8, 17 ​ — To whom do the titles “the Alpha and the Omega ” and“ the First and the Last ” refer?
The title “the Alpha and the Omega ” applies to Jehovah, stressing that there was no almighty God before him and that there will be none after him.
He is “the beginning and the end. ”
Although Jehovah is referred to as “the first and the last ” at Revelation 22: 13, in that there is none before or after him, the context in the first chapter of Revelation shows that the title“ the First and the Last ” there applies to Jesus Christ.
He was the first human to be resurrected to immortal spirit life and the last one to be so resurrected by Jehovah personally. ​ — Col. 1: 18.
2: 7 ​ — What is “the paradise of God ”?
Since these words are addressed to anointed Christians, the paradise here must refer to the paradisaic heavenly realm ​ — the very presence of God himself.
The faithful anointed will be rewarded with eating “of the tree of life. ”
They will receive immortality. ​ — 1 Cor. 15: 53.
3: 7 ​ — When did Jesus receive “the key of David, ” and how has he been using that key?
Upon his baptism in 29 C.E., Jesus became King - Designate in the line of David.
However, Jesus did not receive the key of David until 33 C.E. when he was exalted to the right hand of God in heaven.
Since then, Jesus has been using the key to open up opportunities and privileges related to the Kingdom. In 1919, Jesus placed “the key of the house of David ” upon the shoulder of“ the faithful and discreet slave ” by appointing that slave class “over all his belongings. ” ​ — Isa.
22: 22; Matt.
24: 45, 47.
3: 12 ​ — What is the “new name ” of Jesus?
This name has to do with Jesus ’ new office and privileges.
While no one else gets to know that name in the way that Jesus does, Jesus writes it on his faithful brothers in the heavenly realm, bringing them into a close relationship with him.
He even shares his privileges with them.
1: 3.
Because “the appointed time [for the execution of God’s judgments upon Satan’s world] is near, ” there is an urgent need to understand the message of the book of Revelation and to act on it.
3: 17, 18.
To be rich spiritually, we need to buy from Jesus “gold refined by fire. ”
That is, we should strive to be rich in fine works.
We also need to put on “white outer garments, ” which proclaim our identity as followers of Christ, and use“ eyesalve, ” such as counsel published in the Watchtower magazine, to gain spiritual discernment. ​ — Rev. 19: 8.
7: 13, 14.
The 24 elders represent the 144,000 in their heavenly glory, where they serve not only as kings but also as priests.
They were pictured by the priests in ancient Israel, whom King David organized in 24 divisions.
One of the elders reveals to John the identity of the great crowd.
Therefore, the resurrection of anointed Christians must have begun sometime before 1935.
Because in that year the correct identity of the great crowd was made known to God’s anointed servants on earth. ​ — Luke 22: 28 - 30; Rev. 4: 4; 7: 9.
THE OPENING OF THE SEVENTH SEAL LEADS TO SEVEN TRUMPET BLASTS
8: 1 – 12: 17)
The Lamb opens the seventh seal. Seven angels receive seven trumpets.
Six of the angels blow their trumpets, heralding judgment messages on “a third ” of mankind ​ — Christendom. This is what John sees in the fifth vision.
Participating in the vision that follows, John eats the little scroll and measures the temple sanctuary.
After the blowing of the seventh trumpet, loud voices announce: “The kingdom of the world did become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ. ” ​ — Rev. 10: 10; 11: 1, 15.
The seventh vision enlarges on what is stated at Revelation 11: 15, 17.
A great sign is seen in heaven. The heavenly woman gives birth to a son, a male.
The Devil is ousted from heaven. Being wrathful at the heavenly woman, he goes off “to wage war with the remaining ones of her seed. ” ​ — Rev. 12: 1, 5, 9, 17.
Scriptural Questions Answered:
8: 1 - 5 ​ — Why did a silence occur in heaven, and what was subsequently hurled to the earth?
A symbolic silence occurred in heaven so that “the prayers of the holy ones ” on earth could be heard.
This was at the end of the first world war.
Anointed Christians did not ascend to heaven at the end of the Gentile Times, as many had expected they would.
They experienced difficult times during the war.
So now they prayed fervently for guidance.
In response to their prayers, the angel hurled to the earth a symbolic fire that set the anointed Christians afire spiritually.
Though few in number, they began a worldwide preaching campaign that made God’s Kingdom a burning issue, thus lighting a fire in Christendom.
Thunderous warnings from the Bible were sounded forth, flashes of Scriptural truth were made known, and the realm of false religion was shaken to its foundation, just as buildings are shaken by an earthquake.
8: 6 - 12; 9: 1, 13; 11: 15 ​ — When did the seven angels prepare to blow their trumpets, and when and how were the trumpet blasts sounded?
Preparation to blow the seven trumpets included giving direction to the revitalized members of the John class on earth from 1919 to 1922.
The sounding of the trumpets represents fearless proclamations of Jehovah’s judgments against Satan’s world by God’s people in cooperation with the angels.
Notably, this began with the Cedar Point, Ohio, convention in 1922 and lasts all the way down to the great tribulation.
8: 13; 9: 12; 11: 14 ​ — In what way are the final three trumpet blasts “woes ”?
Whereas the first four trumpet blasts are proclamations exposing the spiritually dead condition of Christendom, the last three are woes in that they have to do with specific events.
The fifth blast is related to the release of God’s people from “the abyss ” of inactivity in 1919 and to their relentless witnessing work, which became like a tormenting plague on Christendom.
The sixth is about the greatest cavalry charge in history and the worldwide preaching campaign that began in 1922.
The final blast has to do with the birth of the Messianic Kingdom.
9: 10, 19.
The authoritative Bible - based statements in the publications of “the faithful and discreet slave ” contain a stinging message.
This message corresponds to the locusts ’ tails that have “stings like scorpions ” and the horses of a cavalry, whose“ tails are like serpents. ”
Because these publications warn of the “day of [Jehovah’s] vengeance. ”
9: 20, 21.
Many meek people who live in so - called non - Christian nations have responded well to the message we proclaim.
However, we are not expecting a mass conversion of people outside the realm of Christendom, who are referred to as “the rest of the men. ”
Nevertheless, we persevere in the ministry.
12: 15, 16.
“The earth ” ​ — elements within Satan’s own system, or the ruling powers in various lands — ​ upheld freedom of worship. Starting in the 1940 ’ s, those powers“ swallowed up the river [of persecution] that the dragon disgorged from its mouth. ”
Indeed, when Jehovah chooses to do so, he can influence governmental authorities to accomplish his will.
Fittingly, therefore, Proverbs 21: 1 states: “A king’s heart is as streams of water in the hand of Jehovah.
Everywhere that he delights to, he turns it. ” This should strengthen our faith in God.

Is God a Real Person?
Common answers:
▪ “He is everywhere, in everything. He is like the wind. ”
▪ “He is an indefinable intelligence, an abstract force. ”
What did Jesus say?
▪ “In the house of my Father there are many abodes. ”
Jesus spoke of God as having a figurative house, or dwelling place.
▪ “I came out from the Father and have come into the world.
Further, I am leaving the world and am going my way to the Father. ” Jesus believed that God is an actual Person living in a specific location.
JESUS never referred to God as some abstract force.
On the contrary, he talked to God and prayed to him.
He often called Jehovah his heavenly Father, a term revealing his deep intimacy with God. ​ — John 8: 19, 38, 54.
It is true that “no man has seen God at any time ” and that“ God is a Spirit. ”
But this does not mean that he is without any type of body or form.
The Bible tells us: “If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual one. ”
So does Jehovah have a spiritual body?
When Jesus was resurrected, he “entered... into heaven itself, now to appear before the person of God for us. ”
This teaches us two important facts about God.
First, he has a place of dwelling.
Second, he is a Person, not simply an indefinable force that resides everywhere.
How, then, can God’s influence be felt everywhere?
God can send his holy spirit, or power in action, to any place in the universe.
Like a father who extends his hand to console and support his children, God extends his holy spirit to accomplish his purpose. ​ — Psalm 104: 30; 139: 7.
Because God is a Person, he also has a personality with likes and dislikes ​ — even feelings.
The Bible tells us that he loves his people, rejoices in his works, hates idolatry, and feels hurt over wickedness.
At 1 Timothy 1: 11, he is called “the happy God. ”
No wonder Jesus said that we can learn to love this God with our whole heart! ​ — Mark 12: 30.

Is Jesus Almighty God?
Common answers:
▪ “Yes, Jesus is God Almighty. ”
▪ “Jesus was the manifestation of God in the flesh. ”
What did Jesus say?
▪ “If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going my way to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am. ”
Jesus acknowledged that he and his Father are not equals.
▪ “I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God. ”
Jesus did not speak of himself as God but spoke of God as a separate Person.
▪ “I have not spoken out of my own impulse, but the Father himself who sent me has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak. ”
Jesus ’ teachings did not come from him; they came from the Father.
JESUS claimed to be the Son of God, not Almighty God.
If Jesus were God, to whom was he praying while here on earth?
Surely Jesus was not just pretending to talk to someone else!
When two of Jesus ’ disciples asked him for special positions in his Kingdom, he answered: “This sitting down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father. ”
Was Jesus telling them a lie when he stated that he did not have the authority to grant their request?
Hardly! Rather, he humbly acknowledged that only God has the authority to make such decisions.
Jesus even explained that there were some things that neither he nor the angels knew but that were known only by his Father. ​ — Mark 13: 32.
Was Jesus lower than God only while he was a man here on earth?
Even after his death and resurrection, Jesus is described in the Bible as being subordinate to God.
The apostle Paul reminds us that “God is supreme over Christ. ”
The Bible says that in the future “when all things have been placed under Christ’s rule, then he himself, the Son, will place himself under God, who placed all things under him; and God will rule completely over all. ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 15: 28, TEV.
Clearly, Jesus is not God Almighty.
That is why he spoke of his Father as “my God. ” ​ — Revelation 3: 2, 12; 2 Corinthians 1: 3, 4.
For more information on this subject, see pages 201 - 204 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach? published by Jehovah’s Witnesses.

Does God Accept All Forms of Worship?
Common answers:
▪ “All religions are paths leading to God. ”
▪ “It doesn’t matter what you believe if you are sincere. ”
What did Jesus say?
▪ “Go in through the narrow gate; because broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it; whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it. ”
Jesus did not believe that all roads lead to God.
▪ “Many will say to me in that day, ‘ Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name? ’
And yet then I will confess to them: I never knew you!
Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness. ”
Jesus does not accept all those who claim to follow him.
MANY religious people treasure their own beliefs and traditions.
But what happens if these teachings are not in harmony with what is found in God’s Word, the Bible?
Jesus showed the danger of following man - made traditions when he said to the religious leaders of his day: “You have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition. ”
He then went on to quote these words of God: “This people honors me with their lips, yet their heart is far removed from me.
It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines. ” ​ — Matthew 15: 1 - 9; Isaiah 29: 13.
Conduct is also important, not just beliefs.
The Bible says of some who claim to worship God: “They publicly declare they know God, but they disown him by their works. ”
In fact, the Bible says of those living in our time: “Instead of loving God, they will love pleasure.
Even though they will make a show of being religious, their religion won’t be real.
Don’t have anything to do with such people. ” ​ — 2 Timothy 3: 4, 5, Contemporary English Version.
Sincerity is required, but more is needed.
Because a person can be sincerely wrong.
So accurate knowledge about God is vital.
Taking in this knowledge and acting in harmony with what the Bible says will enable us to be pleasing to God.
Really, then, right religion involves right motive, right belief, and right action.
And right action means doing the will of God daily! ​ — 1 John 2: 17.

Keys to Family Happiness
John: * Before my parents punished me for some wrongdoing, they would put forth real effort to understand my motive and the circumstances involved.
I try to imitate their approach when dealing with my daughters.
My wife, Alison, comes from a different background.
Her father and mother were more impulsive.
They seem to have chastised their children without being concerned about the circumstances surrounding an incident.
Sometimes I feel that my wife disciplines our children in a similarly harsh manner.
Carol: My father deserted our family when I was just five years old.
He showed no interest in me or my three siblings.
My mom worked very hard to provide for us, and I shouldered a lot of responsibility in caring for my younger sisters.
It was hard to enjoy being a kid when I had to play the role of parent.
To this day, I am more serious than playful.
When my own children need discipline, I agonize over their mistakes.
I like to know why something happened and what the thought process was.
My husband, Mark, by contrast, doesn’t stew over matters.
He was raised by a loving yet firm father, who loyally cared for his mother.
With our girls, my husband is quick to resolve problems.
He assesses a situation, deals with it, and then moves on.
AS THE comments of John and Carol show, your upbringing can exert a profound influence on the way you discipline your own children.
When a husband and wife come from different family backgrounds, they are likely to have very different leanings when it comes to training children.
At times, these differences cause tension in a marriage.
Tension can be exacerbated by exhaustion.
New parents soon learn that disciplining children is a tiring, full - time job.
Joan, who with her husband, Darren, has raised two girls, says: “I love my girls, but they seldom wanted to go to bed when I wanted them to.
They woke up when it was most inconvenient.
They interrupted when I wanted to talk.
They left their shoes, clothes, and toys out and never put the butter back in the fridge. ”
Jack, whose wife suffered from postpartum depression after their second child, says: “I would often come home exhausted from work and then be up half the night with our newborn.
This made it a challenge to discipline our older daughter consistently.
She was jealous at having to share our attention with her little sister. ”
When tired parents clash over how to train a child, small disputes might explode into major arguments.
Unresolved disagreements can become a wedge that drives a couple apart and provides an opening for a child to play one parent against the other.
What Bible principles will help a couple maintain a close marital bond while effectively training their children?
Marriage should exist before the children arrive, and it is intended to remain long after they leave home.
Regarding the marriage union, the Bible says: “What God has yoked together let no man put apart. ”
By contrast, this same passage shows that God intended for a child eventually to “leave his father and his mother. ”
Really, any raising of children is only a phase of a marriage, not the basis of it.
Certainly, parents need to invest time in training their children, but they do well to remember that a strong marriage is the best foundation upon which to do so.
What is one way in which a couple can keep their relationship strong during the child - rearing years?
If at all possible, regularly set aside some time to spend together without the children.
Doing so will allow you to discuss important family issues and just to enjoy each other’s company.
Admittedly, making time to spend together as a couple is not easy.
Alison, the mother referred to earlier, says, “Just when it seems that my husband and I might have a few moments together, our youngest daughter demands attention or our six - year - old experiences some ‘ crisis, ’ like not being able to find her crayons. ”
Joan and Darren, mentioned earlier, made time for each other by enforcing a set time for their girls to go to bed.
“Our girls were always required to be in bed and ready for ‘ lights out ’ at a fixed time, ” says Joan.
By establishing a regular bedtime routine for their children, a couple not only buy out some time for themselves but also help a child not to “think more of himself [or herself] than it is necessary to think. ”
Eventually, children who are trained to respect bedtime rules realize that they are a vital spoke in the family wheel but are not the hub of it ​ — they must conform to the family’s routine rather than expect the family’s routine to conform to their whims.
TRY THIS: Establish a regular bedtime and enforce it consistently.
If your child offers a reason why he or she should stay up a little longer, such as wanting a glass of water, you might want to allow one request.
But do not let your child postpone bedtime indefinitely with an endless string of requests.
If your child pleads to stay up an extra five minutes and you want to grant the wish, set an alarm clock to ring in five minutes.
When the bell sounds, put the child to bed without further concessions.
Let your “Yes mean Yes, your No, No. ” ​ — Matthew 5: 37.
“Listen, my son, to the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the law of your mother, ” states a wise proverb.
This Bible verse implies that both father and mother have the right to exercise authority over their children.
However, even when a couple come from similar family backgrounds, they may disagree about how a child should be disciplined and what family rules should apply in a particular situation.
How can parents deal with that challenge?
John, quoted earlier, says, “I feel that it is important not to disagree in front of the children. ” However, he admits that presenting a united front is more easily said than done.
“Children are very perceptive, ” John says.
“Even if a disagreement is not stated, our daughter can pick up on the emotions. ”
How do John and Alison handle this challenge?
Alison says: “If I disagree with the way my husband is disciplining our daughter, I wait until she is out of hearing range before I offer my input.
I don’t want her to think that she can ‘ divide and conquer ’ by playing on our different points of view.
If she realizes that we disagree, I tell her that every member of the family has to follow Jehovah’s arrangement and that I willingly submit to her father’s headship just as she should submit to our authority as parents. ”
John says: “When we are together as a family, I usually take the lead in disciplining our daughters.
But if Alison is more familiar with a situation, I allow her to initiate the discipline and then I back her up.
If I disagree with her about something, I’ll discuss it with her later. ”
How can you prevent disagreements about child training from building resentment between you and your mate ​ — and, as a consequence, undermining your children’s respect for you?
TRY THIS: Pick a regular time each week to talk about child - training issues, and openly discuss any disagreements you may have.
Try to see your spouse’s point of view, and respect the fact that your spouse has his or her own relationship with the child.
Without a doubt, training children is hard work.
At times, the task may seem to be all - consuming.
Sooner or later, though, your children will leave home, and you and your spouse will feel more like a couple again.
Will your marriage bond be strengthened or strained by the experience of raising children?
The answer will depend on how well you apply the principle found at Ecclesiastes 4: 9, 10: “Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their hard work.
For if one of them should fall, the other one can raise his partner up. ”
When parents work as partners, the results can be very satisfying.
Carol, quoted earlier, expresses her feelings this way: “I knew that my husband had a lot of great qualities, but raising children together has shown me a whole new side of him.
My respect and love for him have grown as I’ve watched the way he lovingly cared for our girls. ”
John says of Alison, “Seeing the way my wife has developed into a caring mother has deepened my love and admiration for her. ”
If you make time for your spouse and work as a team during your child - rearing years, your marriage will grow stronger as your children grow older.
What better example could you set for your children?
Names have been changed.
How much time do I spend with my mate each week without the children around?
In what way do I support my spouse when he or she disciplines our children?
How Jesus ’ Sayings Promote Happiness
“[Jesus] went up into the mountain; and... his disciples came to him; and he... began teaching them. ” ​ — MATT.
1, 2. (a) Under what circumstances did Jesus give his Sermon on the Mount?
(b) How did Jesus begin his discourse?
IT IS the year 31 C.E.
Jesus briefly interrupts his preaching tour of Galilee to observe the Passover in Jerusalem.
Returning to Galilee, he prays all night for God’s guidance in choosing 12 apostles.
The next day a crowd gathers as Jesus heals the sick.
With his disciples and others present, he sits down on a mountainside and begins teaching. ​ — Matt. 4: 23 – 5: 2; Luke 6: 12 - 19.
Jesus starts his discourse ​ — the Sermon on the Mount — ​ by showing that happiness results from having a good relationship with God.
(Read Matthew 5: 1 - 12.)
Happiness is ‘ a state of well - being ranging from contentment to intense joy. ’
The nine happinesses that Jesus pronounced highlight why Christians are happy, and these sayings are as beneficial today as they were nearly 2,000 years ago.
Let us now consider each of them.
“Those Conscious of Their Spiritual Need ”
What does it mean to be conscious of our spiritual need?
“Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them. ”
“Those conscious of their spiritual need ” realize that they are spiritually destitute and need God’s mercy.
4, 5. (a) Why are those conscious of their spiritual need happy?
(b) How can our spiritual need be satisfied?
Those conscious of their spiritual need are happy, “since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them. ”
Accepting Jesus as the Messiah opened up for his early disciples the possibility of ruling with him in God’s heavenly Kingdom.
Whether we personally hope to be a joint heir with Christ in heaven or we look forward to everlasting life in an earthly paradise under Kingdom rule, we can be happy if we are truly conscious of our spiritual need and are fully aware of our dependence on God.
Not all are conscious of their spiritual need, for many lack faith and do not appreciate sacred things.
Ways to satisfy our spiritual need include diligent study of the Bible, zealous activity in the disciple - making work, and regular presence at Christian meetings. ​ — Matt. 28: 19, 20; Heb.
10: 23 - 25. Mourners Who Are “Happy ”
Who are “those who mourn, ” and why are they“ happy ”?
“Happy are those who mourn, since they will be comforted. ”
“Those who mourn ” are the same kind of people as“ those conscious of their spiritual need. ”
They do not mourn in the sense of complaining about their lot in life. Their mourning is sadness over their own sinful state and the conditions existing because of human imperfection.
Why are such mourners “happy ”?
Because they exercise faith in God and Christ and are comforted by having a good relationship with Jehovah. ​ — John 3: 36.
How should we feel about Satan’s world?
Do we individually mourn because of the unrighteousness rampant in Satan’s world?
How do we really feel about what this world has to offer?
The apostle John wrote: “Everything in the world ​ — the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life — ​ does not originate with the Father. ”
But what if we sense that our own spirituality is being eroded by “the spirit of the world, ” the impelling force that dominates human society alienated from God?
Then let us pray fervently, study God’s Word, and seek the help of the elders.
As we draw closer to Jehovah, we will “find comfort ” for ourselves, regardless of what is causing us distress. ​ — 1 Cor. 2: 12; Ps. 119: 52; Jas.
5: 14, 15. How Happy “the Mild - Tempered Ones ”!
8, 9.
What does it mean to be mild - tempered, and why are mild - tempered ones happy?
“Happy are the mild - tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth. ”
“Mildness of temper, ” or meekness, does not suggest weakness or hypocritical gentleness.
If we are mild - tempered, we will display meekness by doing Jehovah’s will and accepting his guidance.
Mildness of temper will also be evident in the way we deal with fellow believers and others. Such meekness harmonizes with the apostle Paul’s counsel. ​ — Read Romans 12: 17 - 19.
Why are the mild - tempered ones happy?
Because “they will inherit the earth, ” said mild - tempered Jesus.
He is the principal Inheritor of the earth.
However, mild - tempered “joint heirs with Christ ” share in his inheritance of the earth.
In the earthly realm of Jesus ’ Kingdom, many other meek ones will enjoy everlasting life. ​ — Ps.
37: 10, 11.
How may a lack of mildness affect our privileges of service and our relationship with others?
Like Jesus, we should be mild - tempered.
But what if we are known for having a belligerent spirit?
Such an aggressive and hostile attitude may cause people to shy away from us.
If we are brothers desiring to have responsibilities in the congregation, this trait disqualifies us.
Paul told Titus to keep reminding Christians in Crete “not to be belligerent, to be reasonable, exhibiting all mildness toward all men. ”
What a blessing such mildness is to others!
They Hunger for “Righteousness ”
11 - 13. (a) What does it mean to hunger and thirst for righteousness?
(b) How are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness “filled ”?
“Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, since they will be filled. ”
The “righteousness ” that Jesus had in mind is the quality of doing what is right by conforming to God’s will and commandments.
The psalmist said that he was “crushed with longing ” for God’s righteous judicial decisions.
Do we prize righteousness so much that we hunger and thirst for it?
Jesus said that those hungering and thirsting for righteousness would be happy because they would be “filled, ” or fully satisfied.
This became possible after Pentecost 33 C.E., for Jehovah’s holy spirit then began to “give the world convincing evidence concerning... righteousness. ”
By means of the holy spirit, God inspired men to compile the Christian Greek Scriptures, which are so beneficial “for disciplining in righteousness. ”
God’s spirit also enables us to “put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness. ”
Is it not comforting to know that those who repentantly seek forgiveness of their sins on the basis of Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice can attain a righteous standing with God? ​ — Read Romans 3: 23, 24.
If we have an earthly hope, our hunger and thirst for righteousness will be fully satisfied when we enjoy everlasting life under righteous conditions on earth.
Meanwhile, let us be determined to live in harmony with Jehovah’s standards.
Jesus said: “Keep on... seeking first the kingdom and [God’s] righteousness. ”
Doing that will fill our hands with godly work and our heart with true happiness. ​ — 1 Cor.
15: 58. Why “the Merciful ” Are Happy
14, 15.
How can we show mercy, and why are “the merciful ” happy?
“Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy. ”
“The merciful ” are moved by compassion and pity for others.
Jesus miraculously relieved the suffering of many because he had pity for them.
Mercy is manifested in a judicial sense when people forgive those who transgress against them, just as Jehovah mercifully forgives repentant ones.
We can show mercy in that way and by our kind words and deeds that bring relief to disadvantaged individuals.
A fine way to show mercy is to share Bible truths with others.
Moved with pity for a crowd, Jesus “started to teach them many things. ” ​ — Mark 6: 34.
We have reason to agree with Jesus ’ statement: “Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy. ”
If we treat others mercifully, they are likely to respond in kind.
We may find that the mercy we have shown to others will triumph over any adverse judgment that God might otherwise bring to bear against us when we are brought into judgment.
Forgiveness of sins and eternal life are only for the merciful. ​ — Matt. 6: 15.
Why “the Pure in Heart ” Are Happy
What does it mean to be “pure in heart, ” and how do those possessing that quality“ see God ”?
“Happy are the pure in heart, since they will see God. ”
If we are “pure in heart, ” purity will be evident in our affections, desires, and motives.
We will display “love out of a clean heart. ”
Being inwardly clean, we will “see God. ”
This does not necessarily mean seeing Jehovah literally, for “no man may see [God] and yet live. ”
Since he perfectly reflected God’s personality, however, Jesus could say: “He that has seen me has seen the Father also. ”
As Jehovah’s worshippers on earth, we can “see God ” by observing him act in our behalf.
For anointed Christians, seeing God reaches its apex when they are resurrected to spirit life and actually see their heavenly Father. ​ — 1 John 3: 2.
Being pure in heart will have what effect on us?
Because a pure heart is morally and spiritually clean, it does not dwell on things that are unclean in Jehovah’s eyes.
If we are pure in heart, what we say and do will have the mark of purity, and there will be nothing hypocritical about our service to Jehovah.
“The Peaceable ” Become Sons of God
18, 19.
How do “the peaceable ” conduct themselves?
“Happy are the peaceable, since they will be called ‘ sons of God. ’ ”
“The peaceable ” are identified by what they will do and by what they will not do.
If we are the kind of people whom Jesus had in mind, we are peaceable and ‘ do not render injury for injury to anyone. ’
Instead, we ‘ always pursue what is good toward others. ’ ​ — 1 Thess. 5: 15.
The Greek term rendered “peaceable ” at Matthew 5: 9 literally means“ peacemakers. ”
To be included among the peaceable, we must actively promote peace.
Peacemakers do not do anything that ‘ separates those familiar with one another. ’
As the peaceable, we take positive steps to “pursue peace with all people. ” ​ — Heb. 12: 14.
Who are now “sons of God, ” and who else will eventually become God’s offspring?
The peaceable are happy because “they will be called ‘ sons of God. ’ ”
Faithful anointed Christians have been adopted by Jehovah and are “sons of God. ”
They already have an intimate relationship with Jehovah as his children because they exercise faith in Christ and wholeheartedly worship “the God of love and of peace. ”
What about Jesus ’ peaceable “other sheep ”?
They will have Jesus as their “Eternal Father ” during his Millennial Reign, but at its end he will subject himself to Jehovah and they will become children of God in a complete sense. ​ — John 10: 16; Isa. 9: 6; Rom. 8: 21; 1 Cor.
15: 27, 28. How will we act if we are “living by spirit ”?
If we are “living by spirit, ” peaceableness will be one of our qualities that is readily seen by others.
We will not be “stirring up competition with one another ” or“ provoking... each other. ”
Instead, we endeavor to be “peaceable with all men. ” ​ — Rom.
12: 18. Happy Though Persecuted!
22 - 24. (a) What accounts for the happiness of those who are persecuted for righteousness ’ sake?
(b) What will we consider in the next two study articles?
“Happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness ’ sake, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them. ”
Expanding on this, Jesus added: “Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake.
Rejoice and leap for joy, since your reward is great in the heavens; for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you. ” ​ — Matt.
5: 11, 12. Like God’s prophets of old, Christians expect to be reproached, persecuted, and lyingly spoken against ​ — all “for righteousness ’ sake. ”
By faithfully enduring such tests, however, we have the satisfaction of pleasing and honoring Jehovah.
Our suffering cannot diminish our delight in serving Jehovah now or in the future.
It cannot lessen either the happiness of ruling with Christ in the heavenly Kingdom or the joy of being granted everlasting life as one of the earthly subjects of that government.
Such blessings provide evidence of God’s favor, benevolence, and generosity.
There is much more to learn from the Sermon on the Mount.
Various lessons are considered in the next two study articles.
Let us see how we might apply those sayings of Jesus Christ.
How Would You Answer?
• Why are “those conscious of their spiritual need ” happy?
• What accounts for the happiness of “the mild - tempered ones ”?
• Why are Christians happy even though they are persecuted?
• Which happiness pronounced by Jesus especially impresses you?

Let Jesus ’ Sayings Affect Your Attitude
“The one whom God sent forth speaks the sayings of God. ” ​ — JOHN 3: 34.
1, 2.
To what might Jesus ’ words in the Sermon on the Mount be likened, and why can we say it was based on “the sayings of God ”?
ONE of the largest cut diamonds known today is the 530 - carat Star of Africa.
It is truly a precious gem!
Far more valuable, however, are the spiritual gems found in Jesus ’ Sermon on the Mount.
No wonder, for the sayings of Christ have Jehovah as their Source!
Referring to Jesus, the Bible says: “The one whom God sent forth speaks the sayings of God. ” ​ — John 3: 34 - 36.
Although the Sermon on the Mount may have been given in less than half an hour, it contained 21 quotations from eight books of the Hebrew Scriptures.
So it was solidly based on “the sayings of God. ”
Let us now see how we can apply some of the many priceless sayings found in this masterful sermon of God’s beloved Son.
“First Make Your Peace With Your Brother ”
After warning his disciples about the effects of wrath, Jesus gave what counsel?
As Christians, we are happy and peaceable because we have God’s holy spirit, and its fruitage includes joy and peace.
Jesus did not want his disciples to lose their peace and happiness, so he warned them about the death - dealing effects of prolonged wrath.
(Read Matthew 5: 21, 22.)
He next declared: “If, then, you are bringing your gift to the altar and you there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar, and go away; first make your peace with your brother, and then, when you have come back, offer up your gift. ” ​ — Matt. 5: 23, 24.
4, 5. (a) What was the “gift ” referred to in Jesus ’ statement recorded at Matthew 5: 23, 24?
(b) How important is it to make peace with an offended brother?
The “gift ” that Jesus mentioned was any offering presented at the temple in Jerusalem.
For example, animal sacrifices were important because they were then part of the worship rendered to Jehovah by his people.
However, Jesus stressed something of greater importance ​ — making peace with an offended brother before offering a gift to God. “Make your peace ” means ‘ to bring about a reconciliation. ’
So, what lesson can we draw from this saying of Jesus?
It must surely be that our way of dealing with others has a direct bearing on our relationship with Jehovah.
Indeed, offerings made to God in ancient times were meaningless if the one making them did not treat fellow humans properly. ​ — Read Micah 6: 6 - 8.
Humility Must Play a Role
6, 7.
Why is humility needed when endeavoring to restore peaceful relations with a brother we have offended?
Humble people do not argue or contend with fellow believers in an effort to establish supposed rights.
That would create an unwholesome state of affairs ​ — one similar to that once existing among Christians in ancient Corinth.
Concerning that situation, the apostle Paul made this thought - provoking point: “It means altogether a defeat for you that you are having lawsuits with one another. Why do you not rather let yourselves be wronged?
6: 7. Jesus did not say that we should go to our brother just to convince him that we are right and he is wrong.
Our objective should be to restore peaceful relations. To make peace, we must honestly express how we feel.
We also need to acknowledge that the other person’s feelings have been hurt.
And if we have been in error, surely we will want to apologize in a humble way.
‘ If Your Right Eye Makes You Stumble ’
Give the substance of Jesus ’ words recorded at Matthew 5: 29, 30.
In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus gave sound counsel on morality.
He knew that our imperfect body members can have a dangerous influence on us.
Jesus therefore said: “If, now, that right eye of yours is making you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you. For it is more beneficial to you for one of your members to be lost to you than for your whole body to be pitched into Gehenna.
Also, if your right hand is making you stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is more beneficial to you for one of your members to be lost than for your whole body to land in Gehenna. ” ​ — Matt. 5: 29, 30.
How can our “eye ” or“ hand ” cause us to “stumble ”?
The “eye ” spoken of by Jesus represents the power or ability to focus our attention on something, and the“ hand ” relates to what we do with our hands.
If care is not exercised, these body parts may cause us to “stumble ” and cease ‘ walking with God. ’
When tempted to disobey Jehovah, then, we need to take strong action, figuratively tearing out an eye or cutting off a hand.
10, 11.
What can help us to avoid sexual immorality?
How can we restrain our eyes from concentrating on immoral things?
“A covenant I have concluded with my eyes, ” said the God - fearing man Job.“ So how could I show myself attentive to a virgin? ”
Job was a married man who was determined not to violate God’s moral laws.
That should be our attitude whether we are married or single.
To avoid sexual immorality, we need to be guided by God’s holy spirit, which produces self - control in those who love God. ​ — Gal. 5: 22 - 25.
To avoid sexual immorality, we might do well to ask ourselves, ‘ Do I allow my eyes to arouse in me an appetite for immoral material readily found in books, on television, or on the Internet? ’
Let us also remember these words of the disciple James: “Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire.
Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death. ”
In fact, if any individual dedicated to God “keeps on looking ” with immoral motives at someone of the opposite sex, he needs to make drastic changes comparable to tearing out the eye and throwing it away. ​ — Read Matthew 5: 27, 28.
What counsel of Paul can help us to fight against immoral desires?
Inasmuch as improper use of our hands can result in serious violations of Jehovah’s moral standards, we must be firmly determined to remain morally clean.
Therefore, we should heed Paul’s counsel: “Deaden... your body members that are upon the earth as respects fornication, uncleanness, sexual appetite, hurtful desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. ”
The word “deaden ” stresses the strong measures that must be taken to fight against immoral fleshly desires.
13, 14.
Why is it vital to avoid immoral thoughts and acts?
In order to preserve his life, a person is likely to be willing to have a limb surgically amputated.
The figurative ‘ throwing away ’ of the eye and the hand is vital for us to avoid immoral thinking and actions that can cost us our spiritual life.
Keeping mentally, morally, and spiritually clean is the only way to escape the everlasting destruction symbolized by Gehenna.
Because of inherited sin and imperfection, maintaining moral cleanness requires effort.
“I pummel my body and lead it as a slave, ” said Paul,“ that, after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow. ”
Let us therefore be determined to apply Jesus ’ counsel on morality, never allowing ourselves to act in ways that show a lack of gratitude for his ransom sacrifice. ​ — Matt.
20: 28; Heb. 6: 4 - 6.
“Practice Giving ”
15, 16. (a) How did Jesus set an example in giving?
(b) What is meant by Jesus ’ words recorded at Luke 6: 38?
He displayed great generosity in coming to the earth for the benefit of imperfect mankind.
(Read 2 Corinthians 8: 9.)
Jesus willingly divested himself of heavenly glory to become a man and give his life for sinful humans, some of whom would gain riches in heaven as his joint heirs in the Kingdom.
And Jesus certainly encouraged generosity when he said:
“Practice giving, and people will give to you.
They will pour into your laps a fine measure, pressed down, shaken together and overflowing.
For with the measure that you are measuring out, they will measure out to you in return. ”
‘ Pouring into the lap ’ refers to a custom of some vendors to fill the fold of a purchaser’s wide upper garment, which was bound with a girdle and made into a pouch for carrying items.
Our own spontaneous generosity may result in our receiving a fine measure in return, perhaps when we are in need. ​ — Eccl.
11: 2.
How did Jehovah set the prime example of giving, and what kind of giving can bring us joy?
Jehovah loves and rewards those who give cheerfully.
He himself set the prime example, giving his only - begotten Son “in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life. ”
Paul wrote: “He that sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. ”
Giving of our time, energy, and material resources to promote true worship is sure to bring us joy and rich rewards. ​ — Read Proverbs 19: 17; Luke 16: 9.
“Do Not Blow a Trumpet Ahead of You ”
Under what circumstances will we “have no reward ” from our heavenly Father?
“Take good care not to practice your righteousness in front of men in order to be observed by them; otherwise you will have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens. ”
By “righteousness, ” Jesus meant conduct that conforms to the divine will.
He did not mean that godly deeds should never be done in public, for he had told his disciples to “let [their] light shine before men. ”
But we will “have no reward ” from our heavenly Father if we do things“ in order to be observed ” and admired, like actors performing onstage in a theater.
If we have such motives, we will not enjoy a close relationship with God or the eternal blessings of Kingdom rule.
19, 20. (a) What did Jesus mean when he spoke against ‘ blowing a trumpet ’ when making “gifts of mercy ”?
(b) How do we not let the left hand know what the right is doing?
If we have a proper attitude, we will follow Jesus ’ admonition: “Hence when you go making gifts of mercy, do not blow a trumpet ahead of you, just as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be glorified by men.
Truly I say to you, They are having their reward in full. ”
“Gifts of mercy ” were donations made to support the needy. (Read Isaiah 58: 6, 7.) Jesus and his apostles had a common fund for use in helping the poor.
Since almsgiving was not literally preceded by trumpet blasts, Jesus evidently used hyperbole when he said that we should not “blow a trumpet ” ahead of us when making“ gifts of mercy. ”
We are not to publicize such giving, as the Jewish Pharisees did.
Jesus called them hypocrites because they advertised their charitable donations “in the synagogues and in the streets. ”
Those hypocrites were “having their reward in full. ”
How, though, were Christ’s disciples to act?
Jesus told them ​ — and us:
“But you, when making gifts of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right is doing, that your gifts of mercy may be in secret; then your Father who is looking on in secret will repay you. ”
Our hands usually work together.
Therefore, not letting the left hand know what the right is doing means that we do not advertise our charitable deeds, even to those as close to us as our left hand is to our right hand.
Repayment from the One “looking on in secret ” includes what?
If we do not boast about our charity, our “gifts of mercy ” will be in secret.
Then our Father, “who is looking on in secret, ” will repay us.
Residing in the heavens and invisible to human eyes, our heavenly Father remains “in secret ” as far as mankind is concerned.
Repayment from the one “looking on in secret ” includes Jehovah’s bringing us into an intimate relationship with him, forgiving our sins, and granting us eternal life.
That is so much better than receiving praise from humans!
Precious Sayings to Be Cherished
22, 23.
Why should we cherish Jesus ’ sayings?
The Sermon on the Mount is certainly full of spiritual gems having many lovely facets.
It unquestionably contains priceless words that can bring us joy even in this troubled world.
Yes, we will be happy if we cherish Jesus ’ sayings and allow them to affect our attitude and way of life.
Everyone who “hears ” and“ does ” what Jesus taught will be blessed. (Read Matthew 7: 24, 25.)
So let us be determined to comply with Jesus ’ counsel.
More of his sayings in the Sermon on the Mount will be considered in the final article of this series.
How Would You Respond?
• Why is it important to make peace with an offended brother?

[Pictures on page 12, 13]
Jehovah blesses those who give cheerfully
Do Jesus ’ Sayings Influence Your Prayers?
“When Jesus finished these sayings, the effect was that the crowds were astounded at his way of teaching. ” ​ — MATT. 7: 28.
1, 2.
Why were the crowds astounded at Jesus ’ way of teaching?
WE OUGHT to accept the sayings of God’s only - begotten Son, Jesus Christ, and apply them in our life.
He certainly spoke like no other man.
Why, people were amazed at the way he taught in the Sermon on the Mount! ​ — Read Matthew 7: 28, 29.
Jehovah’s Son did not teach as did the scribes, who based their wordy speeches on the teachings of imperfect humans.
Christ taught “as a person having authority ” because what he spoke came from God.
So let us see how Jesus ’ further sayings in the Sermon on the Mount can and should influence our prayers.
Never Pray as the Hypocrites Do
Give the essence of Jesus ’ words recorded at Matthew 6: 5.
Prayer is an important part of true worship, and we ought to pray to Jehovah regularly.
But our prayers should be influenced by Jesus ’ sayings in the Sermon on the Mount.
He said: “When you pray, you must not be as the hypocrites; because they like to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the broad ways to be visible to men.
Truly I say to you, They are having their reward in full. ” ​ — Matt.
6: 5. 4 - 6. (a) Why did the Pharisees like to pray “standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the broad ways ”?
(b) How were such hypocrites “having their reward in full ”?
When praying, Jesus ’ disciples were not to imitate such “hypocrites ” as the self - righteous Pharisees, whose public display of piety was nothing more than a pretense.
Those hypocrites liked to pray “standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the broad ways. ”
So as to be “visible to men. ”
First - century Jews customarily prayed as a congregation during the time of the burnt offerings at the temple (about nine o’clock in the morning and three o’clock in the afternoon).
Many residents of Jerusalem would pray along with a crowd of worshippers in the temple precincts. Outside that city, devout Jews often prayed twice a day while “standing in the synagogues. ” ​ — Compare Luke 18: 11, 13.
Since most people were not near the temple or a synagogue for the prayers just mentioned, they might pray wherever they happened to be at those times.
Some liked to have the times for prayer catch them while they were “on the corners of the broad ways. ” They wanted to be“ visible to men ” who were passing through those intersections.
The pious hypocrites would “for a pretext make long prayers ” in order to be admired by onlookers.
That is not the attitude that we should have.
Jesus declared that such hypocrites were “having their reward in full. ”
They greatly desired recognition and praise from fellow humans ​ — and that was all they would get.
It would be their full reward, for Jehovah would not answer their hypocritical prayers.
What is meant by the counsel to pray in our “private room ”?
“You, however, when you pray, go into your private room and, after shutting your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you. ”
Jesus ’ admonition to pray in a private room after shutting the door did not mean that someone could not represent a congregation in prayer.
This counsel was meant to discourage public prayer that was offered to call attention to the one praying and to elicit praise from others.
We should remember this if we are privileged to represent God’s people in public prayer.
Let us also comply with Jesus ’ further admonition respecting prayer.
According to Matthew 6: 7, what abuse of prayer should we avoid?
“When praying, do not say the same things over and over again, just as the people of the nations do, for they imagine they will get a hearing for their use of many words. ”
Jesus thus cited another abuse of prayer ​ — repetition.
He did not mean that we should never repeat heartfelt pleas and expressions of thanksgiving in prayer.
In the garden of Gethsemane on the night before he died, Jesus repeatedly used “the same word ” in prayer. ​ — Mark 14: 32 - 39.
9, 10.
In what sense should we not say repetitious prayers?
It would be wrong for us to mimic the repetitious prayers of “people of the nations. ”
“Over and over again, ” they repeat memorized phrases that include many unnecessary words.
It did worshippers of Baal no good to call upon the name of that false god “from morning till noon, saying: ‘ O Baal, answer us! ’ ”
Millions today offer wordy, repetitious prayers, thinking in vain that they “will get a hearing. ”
But Jesus helps us to realize that the “use of many words ” in long and repetitious prayers is of no value from Jehovah’s standpoint.
Jesus further said:
“So, do not make yourselves like them, for God your Father knows what things you are needing before ever you ask him. ”
Many Jewish religious leaders made themselves like the Gentiles through excessive wordiness when praying.
Heartfelt prayer that includes praise, thanksgiving, and petition is an important part of true worship.
Yet, it would be wrong for us to say the same things over and over again with the thought that repetition is necessary to tell God about our needs.
When we pray, we should remember that we are addressing the One who ‘ knows what we need before ever we ask him. ’
What should we remember if we are privileged to offer public prayer?
Jesus ’ sayings about unacceptable prayers should remind us that God is not impressed by high - sounding speech and superfluous words.
We should also realize that public prayer is not an occasion to try to impress listeners or cause them to wonder how long it will be before we say “Amen. ”
Using prayer to make announcements or to counsel the audience would also be out of harmony with the spirit of Jesus ’ sayings in the Sermon on the Mount.
Jesus Teaches Us How to Pray
How would you explain the significance of the request “let your name be sanctified ”?
Although Jesus warned against abusing the grand privilege of prayer, he did teach his disciples how to pray. (Read Matthew 6: 9 - 13.)
The model prayer is not to be memorized in order to be recited over and over again.
Instead, it furnishes a pattern for our own prayers.
For instance, Jesus put God first with the opening words: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. ”
We properly address Jehovah as “our Father ” because he is our Creator, who dwells“ in the heavens, ” far beyond the earth.
Use of the plural term “our ” should remind us that our fellow believers also have a close relationship with God.
“Let your name be sanctified ” is a petition that Jehovah take action to sanctify himself by clearing his name of all the reproach that has been heaped upon it since the rebellion in Eden.
In answer to that prayer, Jehovah will remove wickedness from the earth, thus sanctifying himself. ​ — Ezek.
36: 23.
(a) How will the request “let your kingdom come ” be fulfilled?
(b) What will the doing of God’s will on earth involve?
“Let your kingdom come.
Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth. ”
In connection with this request in the model prayer, we should remember that the “kingdom ” is the heavenly Messianic government in the hands of Christ and the resurrected“ holy ones ” associated with him.
Praying for it to “come ” is a request that God’s Kingdom come against all earthly opposers of divine rulership.
That will soon occur, paving the way for a global paradise of righteousness, peace, and prosperity.
Jehovah’s will is being done in heaven, and asking that it take place on earth is a plea that God carry out his purposes toward our planet, including the removal of his opposers today as he did in ancient times. ​ — Read Psalm 83: 1, 2, 13 - 18.
Why is it fitting to ask for “our bread for this day ”?
“Give us today our bread for this day. ”
By making this prayerful request, we are asking God to provide necessary food “for this day. ”
This indicates that we have faith in Jehovah’s ability to care for our needs on a daily basis. It is not a prayer for surplus provisions.
This request for our daily needs may remind us that God commanded the Israelites to gather manna “each his amount day for day. ” ​ — Ex.
16: 4.
Explain what is meant by the request “forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. ”
The next request in the model prayer turns our attention to something we need to do. Jesus said: “Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. ” Luke’s Gospel shows that these“ debts ” are “sins. ”
Only if we already “have forgiven ” those sinning against us may we expect forgiveness from Jehovah. (Read Matthew 6: 14, 15.)
We should forgive others freely. ​ — Eph. 4: 32; Col.
3: 13. How are we to understand the requests regarding temptation and deliverance from the wicked one?
“Do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one. ”
How are we to understand these two related requests in Jesus ’ model prayer?
One thing is certain: Jehovah does not tempt us to commit sin. (Read James 1: 13.)
Satan ​ — “the wicked one ” — ​ is the real“ Tempter. ”
However, the Bible speaks of God as doing things that he is merely permitting.
Therefore, “do not bring us into temptation ” is a petition that Jehovah not permit us to succumb when we are tempted to disobey him.
Finally, the plea “deliver us from the wicked one ” is a request that Jehovah not allow Satan to overcome us.
And we can be confident that ‘ God will not let us be tempted beyond what we can bear. ’ ​ — Read 1 Corinthians 10: 13.
‘ Keep On Asking, Seeking, Knocking ’
17, 18.
What does it mean to ‘ keep on asking, seeking, and knocking ’?
The apostle Paul urged fellow believers: “Persevere in prayer. ”
Jesus made a powerful point along those lines when he declared: “Keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you.
For everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking it will be opened. ”
It is proper to “keep on asking ” for anything that is in harmony with God’s will.
In keeping with Jesus ’ words, the apostle John wrote: “This is the confidence that we have toward [God], that, no matter what it is that we ask according to his will, he hears us. ” ​ — 1 John 5: 14.
Jesus ’ counsel to ‘ keep on asking and seeking ’ means that we should pray earnestly and not give up.
It is also necessary for us to “keep on knocking ” to gain access to the Kingdom and enjoy its blessings, benefits, and rewards.
But can we be confident that God will answer our prayers?
Yes, we can if we are faithful to Jehovah, for Christ said: “Everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking it will be opened. ”
Many experiences enjoyed by Jehovah’s servants prove that God truly is the “Hearer of prayer. ” ​ — Ps.
65: 2.
19, 20.
In view of Jesus ’ words recorded at Matthew 7: 9 - 11, how is Jehovah like a loving father?
Jesus likened God to a loving father who provides good things for his offspring.
Imagine that you were present for the Sermon on the Mount and heard Jesus say: “Who is the man among you whom his son asks for bread ​ — he will not hand him a stone, will he?
Or, perhaps, he will ask for a fish ​ — he will not hand him a serpent, will he?
Therefore, if you, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those asking him? ” ​ — Matt. 7: 9 - 11.
A human father, although comparatively “wicked ” because of inherited sin, has natural affection for his offspring.
He would not deceive his child but would strive to provide him with “good gifts. ”
With a fatherly attitude toward us, our loving heavenly Father provides “good things, ” such as his holy spirit.
It can strengthen us to render acceptable service to Jehovah, the Provider of “every good gift and every perfect present. ” ​ — Jas.
1: 17. Continue to Benefit From Jesus ’ Sayings
21, 22.
What is noteworthy about the Sermon on the Mount, and how do you feel about these sayings of Jesus?
The Sermon on the Mount was indeed the greatest discourse ever given on earth.
It is remarkable for its spiritual content and clarity.
As shown by the points drawn from it in this series of articles, we can benefit greatly if we apply the counsel that this sermon contains.
These sayings of Jesus can improve our life now and give us the hope of a happy future.
In these articles, we have examined only a few of the spiritual gems in Jesus ’ Sermon on the Mount.
No wonder those who heard his discourse “were astounded at his way of teaching. ”
That will undoubtedly be our reaction too when we fill our minds and hearts with these and other priceless sayings of the Great Teacher, Jesus Christ.

They “Keep Following the Lamb ”
“These are the ones that keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes. ” ​ — REV.
14: 4. How did true disciples of Jesus feel about following him?
ABOUT two and a half years into his ministry, Jesus “was teaching in public assembly at Capernaum. ”
Finding his speech shocking, “many of his disciples went off to the things behind and would no longer walk with him. ”
When Jesus asked his 12 apostles if they also wanted to go, Simon Peter replied: “Lord, whom shall we go away to?
You have sayings of everlasting life; and we have believed and come to know that you are the Holy One of God. ”
True disciples of Jesus refused to quit following him.
After being anointed with holy spirit, they continued to submit to Jesus ’ direction. ​ — Acts 16: 7 - 10.
(a) Who is “the faithful and discreet slave, ” or“ the faithful steward ”?
(b) How has the slave established a fine record of “following the Lamb ”?
What can be said about the anointed Christians in modern times?
In his prophecy about “the sign of [his] presence and of the conclusion of the system of things, ” Jesus referred to the composite body of his spirit - anointed followers on earth as“ the faithful and discreet slave, ” or “the faithful steward. ” As a group, the slave class has established an excellent record of“ following the Lamb no matter where he goes. ”
(Read Revelation 14: 4, 5.)
Its members remain virgins in a spiritual sense by not defiling themselves with the beliefs and practices of “Babylon the Great, ” the world empire of false religion.
No doctrinal falsehood is “found in their mouths, ” and they remain“ without blemish ” from Satan’s world.
In the future, the remaining anointed ones on earth “will follow ” the Lamb right into heaven. ​ — John 13: 36.
Why is it important for us to trust the slave class?
Jesus has appointed the faithful and discreet slave “over his domestics, ” that is, the individual members of the slave class,“ to give them their food at the proper time. ”
He has also appointed the slave “over all his belongings. ”
These “belongings ” include the growing“ great crowd ” of “other sheep. ”
Should not individual members of the anointed and the “other sheep ” trust the slave appointed over them?
There are many reasons why the slave class deserves our trust. Two outstanding reasons are: (1) Jehovah trusts the slave class. (2) Jesus also trusts the slave.
Let us examine the evidence that both Jehovah God and Jesus Christ have complete confidence in the faithful and discreet slave.
Jehovah Trusts the Slave
Why can we have confidence in the spiritual food served by the faithful and discreet slave?
Consider what makes it possible for the faithful and discreet slave to provide timely, nutritious spiritual food.
“I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go, ” says Jehovah.
He adds: “I will give advice with my eye upon you. ”
Yes, Jehovah provides direction to the slave.
We can therefore have full confidence in the Scriptural insight, understanding, and guidance that we receive from the slave.
What shows that God’s spirit is empowering the slave class?
Jehovah also blesses the slave class with his holy spirit.
While Jehovah’s spirit is invisible, what it produces in those upon whom it operates is not.
Think of what the faithful and discreet slave has been able to accomplish in giving a worldwide witness about Jehovah God, his Son, and the Kingdom.
Jehovah’s worshippers are actively proclaiming the Kingdom message in over 230 lands and island groups.
Does that not give undeniable evidence that God’s spirit is empowering the slave? (Read Acts 1: 8.)
In providing timely spiritual food for Jehovah’s people the world over, the slave class must make vital decisions.
In making them and putting them into effect, the slave exhibits love, mildness, and other aspects of the spirit’s fruitage. ​ — Gal. 5: 22, 23.
6, 7.
To what extent does Jehovah trust the faithful slave?
To appreciate the extent of Jehovah’s trust in the faithful slave, reflect on what he has promised its members.
“The trumpet will sound, ” wrote the apostle Paul,“ and the dead will be raised up incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
For this which is corruptible must put on incorruption, and this which is mortal must put on immortality. ”
The anointed followers of Christ, who serve God faithfully and die in corruptible human bodies, are resurrected as something more than spirit creatures having everlasting life.
They are given immortality ​ — endlessness and indestructibility.
Moreover, they receive incorruption, being given bodies that are beyond decay and apparently are self - sustaining.
Revelation 4: 4 describes these resurrected ones as seated upon thrones with golden crowns upon their heads. The glory of royalty awaits anointed Christians.
But there is more.
“The marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself. Yes, it has been granted to her to be arrayed in bright, clean, fine linen, for the fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the holy ones, ” states Revelation 19: 7, 8.
Jehovah has chosen the anointed Christians to be the future bride for his Son.
Incorruption, immortality, royalty, “the marriage of the Lamb ” ​ — what awe - inspiring gifts these are!
They are stirring evidence of God’s confidence in the anointed, who “keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes. ”
The Slave Is Trusted by Jesus
How does Jesus show that he has confidence in his spirit - anointed followers?
What evidence is there that Jesus completely trusts his spirit - anointed followers?
On the last night of his life on earth, Jesus made a promise to his 11 faithful apostles.
“You are the ones that have stuck with me in my trials, ” he told them,“ and I make a covenant with you, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom, that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. ”
The covenant that Jesus then made with the 11 will extend to all 144,000 anointed Christians.
If he did not trust them, would Jesus make a covenant that meant sharing his Kingdom power with them?
What are included in “all [Christ’s] belongings ”?
Moreover, Jesus Christ has appointed the faithful and discreet slave “over all his belongings ” ​ — all Kingdom interests on earth.
Included among these belongings are the facilities at the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses, at branch offices in various lands, and at Assembly Halls and Kingdom Halls worldwide. Included too is the work of Kingdom - preaching and disciple - making.
Would anyone assign someone he did not trust to keep and use his valuable things?
What shows that Jesus Christ is with his anointed followers?
Shortly before he ascended to heaven, the resurrected Jesus appeared to his faithful disciples and made a promise to them, saying: “Look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things. ”
Has this promise proved reliable?
In the last 15 years, the number of congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide has grown from some 70,000 to over 100,000 ​ — an increase of over 40 percent.
And what about the new disciples added?
Nearly 4.5 million disciples were baptized in the last 15 years ​ — an average of more than 800 a day.
These spectacular increases are clear evidence that Christ is directing his anointed followers at their congregation meetings and is supporting them in their disciple - making work.
The Slave Is Faithful and Discreet
11, 12.
How has the slave shown itself to be faithful and discreet?
Since Jehovah God and Jesus Christ completely trust the faithful and discreet slave, should we not do the same?
After all, the slave has shown itself to be faithful in doing its assigned work.
For example, the Watchtower magazine has been published for some 130 years.
Meetings, assemblies, and conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses continue to build us up spiritually.
The faithful slave is also discreet in that it neither acts immodestly, running ahead of Jehovah, nor lags behind when God’s direction on a matter is clear.
For example, while false religious leaders tacitly approve or openly condone as normal the selfish, godless conduct of the people of the world, the slave provides warnings against the pitfalls of Satan’s wicked system.
The slave is able to provide wise and timely warnings because Jehovah God and Jesus Christ are blessing it.
The slave thus deserves our complete trust.
How, though, can we demonstrate that we trust the faithful and discreet slave?
“Go With ” the Anointed as They Follow the Lamb
According to Zechariah’s prophecy, how is it possible to demonstrate trust in the faithful and discreet slave?
The Bible book of Zechariah speaks of “ten men ” who approach“ a man who is a Jew ” and say: “We will go with you people. ” (Read Zechariah 8: 23.)
Since “a man who is a Jew ” is spoken of as“ you people, ” he is a composite man.
In our time, he represents the remnant of spirit - anointed Christians ​ — part of “the Israel of God. ”
The “ten men out of all the languages of the nations ” represent the great crowd of other sheep.
Just as the anointed Christians follow Jesus no matter where he goes, the great crowd ‘ goes with, ’ or accompanies, the faithful and discreet slave.
Those of the great crowd should never be ashamed to identify themselves as companions of the “partakers of the heavenly calling. ”
Jesus is not ashamed to call the anointed ones “brothers. ” ​ — Heb. 2: 11.
How can loyal support be given to Christ’s brothers?
Jesus Christ considers the loyal support given to his brothers as being given to him. (Read Matthew 25: 40.)
In what way, then, can those who have the earthly hope support Christ’s spirit - anointed brothers?
Principally by helping them with the Kingdom - preaching work.
While the number of anointed ones on the earth has decreased over the decades, the number of the other sheep has increased.
When those who have an earthly hope share in the witness work, serving if possible as full - time evangelizers, they support the spirit - anointed ones in fulfilling the disciple - making assignment.
Not to be overlooked are the opportunities to support this work by making financial contributions in various ways.
How should individual Christians respond to timely spiritual food from the slave and organizational decisions made by the slave?
As individual Christians, how do we view the timely spiritual food that the faithful slave dispenses by means of Bible - based publications and through Christian gatherings?
Do we gratefully partake of it and readily apply what we learn?
What is our response to organizational decisions made by the slave?
Our willing obedience to the direction provided gives evidence of our faith in Jehovah’s arrangement. ​ — Jas. 3: 17.
Why should all Christians listen to Christ’s brothers?
“My sheep listen to my voice, ” said Jesus,“ and I know them, and they follow me. ”
That is true of the anointed Christians.
What about those who “go with ” them? Such ones must listen to Jesus.
They must also listen to his brothers. After all, the chief responsibility for caring for the spiritual welfare of God’s people has been entrusted to them.
What does listening to the voice of Christ’s brothers involve?
What does listening to the slave class involve?
The faithful and discreet slave today is represented by the Governing Body, who take the lead and coordinate the Kingdom - preaching work throughout the earth.
The members of the Governing Body are experienced, spirit - anointed elders.
They in particular can be described as “those who are taking the lead ” among us.
In caring for over 7,000,000 Kingdom proclaimers worldwide in over 100,000 congregations, these anointed overseers have “plenty to do in the work of the Lord. ”
Listening to the slave class means giving our full cooperation to its Governing Body.
Those Who Listen to the Slave Are Blessed
18, 19. (a) How are those who listen to the faithful and discreet slave blessed?
(b) What should be our determination?
Since its appointment, the faithful and discreet slave has been “bringing the many to righteousness. ”
These include those who have the hope of surviving the destruction of the present wicked system of things.
What a blessing this righteous standing with God is!
In the future, when ‘ the holy city, New Jerusalem [consisting of 144,000] comes down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband, ’ what will those who have listened to the voice of the slave experience?
“God himself will be with them, ” says the Bible.
“And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away. ”
By all means, then, let us listen to the Christ and his trustworthy spirit - anointed brothers.

Jehovah’s Word Is Alive
Highlights From the Book of Revelation ​ — II
WHAT lies ahead for those who worship Jehovah God and for those who do not?
What is the future of Satan and his demons?
What blessings will obedient mankind experience during the Thousand Year Reign of Christ?
The answers to these and other vital questions are revealed at Revelation 13: 1 – 22: 21.
* These chapters contain the last 9 of the 16 visions that the apostle John received near the end of the first century C.E.
“Happy is he who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy, ” writes John,“ and who observe the things written in it. ”
Reading and applying what we learn from the book of Revelation can affect our heart, strengthen our faith in God and his Son, Jesus Christ, and give us a bright hope for the future.
4: 12. SEVEN BOWLS OF GOD’S ANGER ARE POURED OUT
13: 1 – 16: 21)
“The nations became wrathful, ” states Revelation 11: 18,“ and [God’s] own wrath came, and the appointed time... to bring to ruin those ruining the earth. ”
Providing background for this, the eighth vision shows the activity of “a wild beast... with ten horns and seven heads. ” ​ — Rev.
13: 1.
In the ninth vision, John sees “the Lamb standing upon the Mount Zion ” and with him“ a hundred and forty - four thousand. ”
They have been “bought from among mankind. ”
Angelic announcements follow.
In the next vision, John beholds “seven angels with seven plagues. ”
Evidently, Jehovah himself commands these angels to pour out “the seven bowls of the anger of God ” on various features of Satan’s world.
The bowls contain pronouncements and warnings of the judgments God will execute.
These two visions give details of further Kingdom judgments connected with the third woe and the blowing of the seventh trumpet. ​ — Rev. 11: 14, 15.
Scriptural Questions Answered:
13: 8 ​ — What is “the scroll of life of the Lamb ”?
This is a figurative scroll containing only the names of those who rule with Jesus Christ in his heavenly Kingdom.
It includes the names of anointed Christians still on earth, who have the hope of receiving life in heaven.
13: 11 - 13 ​ — How does the wild beast with two horns act like a dragon and make fire come down out of heaven?
The fact that the two - horned wild beast ​ — the Anglo - American World Power — ​ speaks like a dragon indicates that it uses threats, pressure, and violence to enforce acceptance of its form of rulership.
It makes fire come out of heaven in that it assumes a prophetlike role by claiming to have conquered the forces of evil in the two world wars of the 20th century and to have won a victory over Communism.
16: 17 ​ — What is “the air ” upon which the seventh bowl is poured out?
“The air ” symbolizes satanic thinking,“ the spirit [mental inclination] that now operates in the sons of disobedience. ”
This poisonous air is breathed by Satan’s entire wicked system of things. ​ — Eph.
2: 2. Lessons for Us:
13: 1 - 4, 18.
“A wild beast ” symbolizing human governments ascends“ out of the sea, ” that is, from the turbulent masses of mankind.
This beast, created and empowered by Satan, has the number 666, denoting heightened imperfection.
Understanding what the beast is helps us so that we neither follow it with admiration nor worship it as mankind in general does. ​ — John 12: 31; 15: 19.
13: 16, 17.
Despite the hardships we may encounter in carrying out such everyday activities as ‘ buying or selling, ’ we should not allow ourselves to be pressured into letting the wild beast rule our lives.
Accepting ‘ the mark of the wild beast in our hand or upon our forehead ’ would amount to permitting the wild beast to control our actions or affect our thinking.
14: 6, 7.
The angelic proclamation teaches us that we should declare the good news of the established Kingdom of God with urgency.
We should help our Bible students to develop a healthy fear of God and to give glory to Jehovah.
14: 14 - 20.
When “the harvest of the earth, ” that is, the harvest of those who will be saved, is completed, it will be time for the angel to hurl“ into the great winepress of the anger of God ” the gathering of “the vine of the earth. ”
That vine ​ — Satan’s corrupt visible system of governments over mankind with its “clusters ” of evil fruitage — ​ will then be destroyed forever.
We should be determined not to be influenced by the vine of the earth.
16: 13 - 16.
“Unclean inspired expressions ” symbolize demonic propaganda intended to ensure that the kings of the earth are not swayed by the pouring out of the seven bowls of God’s anger but instead are maneuvered into opposition to Jehovah. ​ — Matt. 24: 42, 44.
16: 21.
As the end of this world nears, the proclamation of Jehovah’s judgments against Satan’s wicked system may involve unusually heavy verbal expressions of God’s judgments, likely pictured by congealed water.
Still, most of mankind will continue to blaspheme God.
THE TRIUMPHANT KING RULES
17: 1 – 22: 21)
“Babylon the Great, ” the world empire of false religion, is a disgusting segment of Satan’s wicked world.
The 11th vision portrays her as a “great harlot ” ​ — an immoral woman — ​“ sitting upon a scarlet - colored wild beast. ”
She is to be completely destroyed by “the ten horns ” of the very beast that is carrying her.
Likening the harlot to a “great city, ” the subsequent vision announces her fall and issues an urgent call to God’s people to“ get out of her. ”
The demise of the great city is mourned by many.
There is rejoicing in heaven, however, because of “the marriage of the Lamb. ” In the 13th vision, the rider of“ a white horse ” goes to war with the nations.
He brings Satan’s wicked world to its end. ​ — Rev. 19: 11 - 16.
What about “the original serpent, who is the Devil and Satan ”?
When will he be “hurled into the lake of fire ”?
That is one of the subjects of the 14th vision. The last two visions give glimpses of life during the Millennium.
As the “revelation ” comes to an end, John sees ‘ a river of water of life flowing down the middle of the broad way, ’ and a wonderful invitation is extended to“ anyone thirsting. ” ​ — Rev. 1: 1; 22: 1, 2, 17.
Scriptural Questions Answered:
17: 16; 18: 9, 10 ​ — Why do “the kings of the earth ” grieve over the very entity they themselves have devastated?
The reason for their grief is strictly selfish.
After the destruction of Babylon the Great, the kings of the earth evidently come to realize how useful she was to them.
She provided a religious front for their oppressive deeds.
Babylon the Great also helped them in recruiting youths for the battlefields.
Moreover, she played an important part in keeping people in subjection.
19: 12 ​ — How is it that no one but Jesus himself knows his unstated name?
This name seems to stand for the position and privileges, such as those stated at Isaiah 9: 6, that Jesus enjoys during the Lord’s day.
No one knows this name but he himself in that his privileges are unique and only he can comprehend what it means to hold such a high office.
However, Jesus shares some of these privileges with the members of his bride class, in effect ‘ writing upon them that new name of his. ’ ​ — Rev. 3: 12.
19: 14 ​ — Who will ride with Jesus at Armageddon?
Included among ‘ the armies in heaven ’ that join Jesus in God’s war will be angels as well as the anointed conquerors who have already received their heavenly reward. ​ — Matt. 25: 31, 32; Rev. 2: 26, 27.
20: 11 - 15 ​ — Whose names are written in “the scroll [or,“ the book ”] of life ”?
This is the scroll containing the names of all those who come in line to receive everlasting life ​ — the anointed Christians, the members of the great crowd, and the faithful servants of God who will experience the ‘ resurrection of the righteous. ’
Those who will come to life in the ‘ resurrection of the unrighteous ’ will have their names written in “the scroll of life ” only if they act in harmony with the“ things written in the scrolls ” of instructions opened during the Millennium.
However, the entries are not made with indelible ink.
The names of the anointed become permanent upon their proving themselves faithful to death.
The names of those who receive life on earth become lasting entries when they pass the final test at the end of the thousand years. ​ — Rev.
20: 7, 8. Lessons for Us:
17: 3, 5, 7, 16.
“The wisdom from above ” helps us to understand“ the mystery of the woman and of the [scarlet - colored] wild beast that is carrying her. ”
This symbolic wild beast began as the League of Nations and was later revived as the United Nations.
Should not the unraveling of this mystery move us to be zealous in preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom and proclaiming the day of Jehovah’s judgment?
21: 1 - 6.
We can be absolutely certain that foretold blessings under Kingdom rule will become a reality.
Because concerning them, it is said: “They have come to pass! ”
22: 1, 17.
The “river of water of life ” represents Jehovah’s provisions for recovering obedient humans from sin and death.
A measure of this water is available now.
May we not only gratefully accept the invitation to come and “take life’s water free ” but also eagerly extend it to others!

Should You Insist on Your Personal Preferences?
TWO young children are playing together.
One child grabs his favorite toy away from the other child and screams, “Mine! ”
From an early age, imperfect humans display a measure of selfishness.
Moreover, the world in general promotes a me - first attitude.
If we are to avoid this spirit, we must put up a hard fight against selfish tendencies.
Unless we do so, we can easily stumble others and weaken our relationship with Jehovah. ​ — Rom.
7: 21 - 23. Encouraging us to take into consideration the effect that our actions have on others, the apostle Paul wrote: “All things are lawful; but not all things are advantageous.
All things are lawful; but not all things build up. ”
Paul also said: “Keep from becoming causes for stumbling. ”
In matters involving personal preferences, then, it is the course of wisdom to ask ourselves: ‘ Am I willing to forgo certain rights when the peace of the congregation is threatened?
Am I prepared to conform to Bible principles, even when it is inconvenient to do so? ’
In Choosing Employment
Most people view their choice of employment as a personal decision that has very little ​ — if any — ​ impact on others.
But consider the experience of a businessman from a small town in South America.
He was known as a gambler and a drunkard.
As a result of studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses, however, he made spiritual progress and changed his way of life.
When he expressed interest in preaching publicly with the congregation, an elder tactfully encouraged him to think about the nature of his secular work.
For some time, the man had been the town’s main distributor of pure cane alcohol ​ — a product having many uses but in that region commonly mixed with soft drinks and consumed for the sole purpose of getting drunk.
The man discerned that if he preached publicly but still sold such a product, this would put the congregation in a bad light and could damage his relationship with God.
Although he had a large family to support, he stopped selling alcohol.
He now supports his family by selling paper products.
This man, his wife, and two of their five children are now baptized.
They zealously preach the good news with freeness of speech.
In Choosing Associates
Is socializing with those who do not share our faith simply a question of personal preference, or are Bible principles involved?
One sister wanted to go to a party with a young man who was not a true Christian. Although warned of the dangers, she felt that it was her right to do so and therefore went to the party.
Not long after she arrived, she was given a drink laced with a powerful sedative.
She woke up several hours later and found that she had been raped by her so - called friend. ​ — Compare Genesis 34: 2.
While associating with unbelievers may not always result in a tragedy such as that, the Bible warns: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly. ”
There is no question about it ​ — choosing bad associates exposes us to danger!
“Shrewd is the one that has seen the calamity and proceeds to conceal himself, ” states Proverbs 22: 3,“ but the inexperienced have passed along and must suffer the penalty. ”
Our associates can affect us and our relationship with God. ​ — 1 Cor. 15: 33; Jas.
4: 4. In Dress and Grooming
Styles and fashions change with every season.
However, Bible principles about dress and grooming remain constant.
Paul urged Christian women to “adorn themselves in well - arranged dress, with modesty and soundness of mind ” ​ — a principle that applies with equal force to men.
Paul was not recommending an extremely plain style of dress, nor was he saying that all Christians must have the same taste.
But what about modesty? One dictionary defines modesty as “freedom from conceit or vanity... propriety in dress, speech, or conduct. ”
We need to ask ourselves: ‘ Can I honestly say that I am being modest if I insist on my right to dress in a manner that calls undue attention to me?
Does my manner of dress send a wrong signal about who I am or the morals I live by? ’
We can avoid “giving any cause for stumbling ” in this regard by“ keeping an eye, not in personal interest upon just [our] own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others. ” ​ — 2 Cor.
6: 3; Phil. 2: 4. In Business Matters
When serious issues arose relating to wrong or fraudulent dealings in the congregation in Corinth, Paul wrote: “Why do you not rather let yourselves be wronged?
Why do you not rather let yourselves be defrauded? ”
Paul counseled Christians to be willing to give something up rather than to take a brother to court.
A brother in the United States took this counsel to heart.
He had a difference of opinion with his Christian employer about wages that were owed him.
Following Scriptural guidelines, the two brothers met time and again but without finding a solution to the problem.
Finally, they took the matter “to the congregation, ” as represented by Christian elders. ​ — Matt.
18: 15 - 17. Sadly, the issue still could not be resolved.
After much prayer, the employee decided to forfeit most of the money he felt he was owed.
He later said, “This disagreement was robbing me of my joy and consuming precious time that could be used in spiritual pursuits. ”
After making that decision, the brother felt his joy returning, and he sensed Jehovah’s blessing on his service. Even in Little Things
Not insisting on our personal preferences also brings blessings in small matters.
On the first day of a district convention, a pioneer couple arrived early and secured the exact seats they desired.
As the program began, a large family with several children hurried into the crowded coliseum.
Noticing that the family was searching for adequate seating, the pioneer couple gave up their two seats.
This made it possible for the entire family to sit together.
A few days after the convention, the pioneers received a thank - you letter from the family.
The letter explained how discouraged they were when they arrived at the convention late.
That feeling soon changed to joy and gratitude because of the pioneer couple’s kindness.
When we have the opportunity, let us willingly forgo our preferences in behalf of others.
By displaying love that “does not look for its own interests, ” we help to maintain peace within the congregation and with our neighbors.
But most important of all, we preserve our friendship with Jehovah.

Christian Funerals ​ — Dignified, Modest, and Pleasing to God
THE air is filled with the sounds of grief.
Mourners dressed in special black garments wail, frantically throwing themselves to the ground in sorrow. Dancers sway to the rhythm of pulsating music.
Yet others are eating and celebrating with loud laughter and merrymaking.
A few lie on the ground, intoxicated from the free flow of palm wine and beer.
In some parts of the world, these are typical features of a funeral where hundreds of people gather to say their farewells to the dead.
Millions of people believe that when someone dies, he becomes an ancestral spirit with the ability to help or harm the living.
This belief is interwoven with numerous funeral customs.
On occasion, Jesus and his disciples mourned the death of loved ones.
Yet, at no time did they exhibit any of the extreme expressions of mourning that were common in their day.
Why? One reason was that they knew the truth about death.
The Bible clearly states: “The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all...
Their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished...
There is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol [mankind’s common grave], the place to which you are going. ”
These inspired Bible verses make it clear that when someone dies, he is no longer conscious.
He cannot think, feel, communicate, or comprehend anything.
How should understanding this important Bible truth affect the way Christian funerals are conducted?
“Quit Touching the Unclean Thing ”
Regardless of their ethnic or cultural background, Jehovah’s Witnesses strictly avoid any customs associated with the belief that the dead are conscious and can influence the living.
Such customs as wake keeping, funeral celebrations, funeral anniversaries, sacrifices for the dead, and widowhood rites are all unclean and displeasing to God because they are linked to the unscriptural, demonic teaching that the soul or spirit does not die.
True Christians “cannot be partaking of ‘ the table of Jehovah ’ and the table of demons, ” so they do not share in these customs.
They obey the command: “Separate yourselves,... and quit touching the unclean thing. ”
Taking such a stand, though, is not always easy.
In Africa and elsewhere, it is widely believed that unless certain customs are followed, spirit ancestors will be offended.
Failure to comply is considered a serious offense that could result in a community curse or misfortune.
Because of refusing to participate in unscriptural funeral rites, many of Jehovah’s people have been criticized, insulted, and treated as outcasts by their village communities or extended families.
Some have been accused of being antisocial and disrespectful of the dead.
At times, unbelievers have forcibly taken over Christian funeral arrangements.
Therefore, how can we avoid confrontation with those who strongly insist on adhering to funeral customs that displease God?
Even more important, what can we do to keep ourselves separate from unclean rites and practices that can damage our relationship with Jehovah?
Make Your Stand Clear
In some parts of the world, it is customary for clan elders and relatives outside the immediate family to have a say in the burial of the dead.
A faithful Christian must therefore make it clear that the funeral will be organized and carried out by Jehovah’s Witnesses according to Bible principles.
What happens at a Christian funeral should not disturb the consciences of fellow believers or stumble others who know what we believe and teach about the dead.
When a representative of the Christian congregation is asked to conduct a funeral, the appointed elders can offer helpful suggestions and provide spiritual support so that all the arrangements harmonize with Scriptural guidelines.
If some non - Witnesses desire to introduce unclean practices, it is vital to stand firm and courageously explain our Christian position in a kind and respectful manner.
But what if unbelieving relatives still insist on introducing unclean rites into the arrangements?
Then the believing family may decide to withdraw from the funeral.
When this happens, a simple memorial service may be held at the local Kingdom Hall or at another suitable location in order to share “comfort from the Scriptures ” with those who are sincerely saddened by the death of the loved one.
Even though the body of the deceased is not present, such an arrangement would be dignified and entirely acceptable.
4: 7.
Put Your Position in Writing
When a person has put in writing his personal instructions regarding his funeral arrangements, it is much easier to reason with non - Witness family members, since they are likely to respect the wishes of the deceased.
How the funeral should be conducted, where it should take place, and who should have the sole authority to organize and hold it are important details that need to be put in writing.
Most effective is a document that is signed and witnessed.
Those who look ahead with insight and wisdom based on Bible principles know that they need not wait until they are very old or terminally ill before they consider taking this step. ​ — Prov.
22: 3; Eccl.
9: 12.
Some have felt uneasy about putting such instructions into a written document.
However, doing so is evidence of Christian maturity and loving concern for others.
It is much better to set these matters straight personally than to leave the settling of such arrangements to distressed family members, who may be pressured into accepting unclean practices that the deceased neither believed in nor approved of.
Keep the Funeral Modest
In many parts of Africa, there is the widespread belief that a funeral must be large and impressive so as not to anger the ancestral spirits.
Others use funerals as an opportunity to make a “showy display ” of their social and economic status.
Much time and effort as well as many resources are devoted to giving the deceased a “proper ” burial.
To attract as many people as possible, large posters bearing a picture of the deceased are placed in different locations, thus publicly advertising the funeral.
T - shirts bearing a portrait of the deceased are produced and distributed so that they can be worn by mourners.
Elaborate, expensive coffins are purchased to impress onlookers.
In one African land, some go to the extent of constructing coffins that resemble cars, airplanes, boats, and other objects designed to exhibit wealth, grandeur, and luxury.
The corpse may be removed from the coffin and displayed on a specially decorated bed.
A woman may be clothed in a white wedding dress and adorned with large amounts of jewelry, beads, and makeup.
Would participating in such practices really be fitting for any of God’s people?
Mature Christians see the wisdom of avoiding the extremes indulged in by people who neither know nor care about godly principles.
We are aware that immodest and unscriptural customs and practices ‘ do not originate with God, but originate with the world that is passing away. ’
Great care must be exercised so that we are not drawn into an unchristian spirit of competition, trying to outdo others.
Experience shows that when fear of the dead is at the heart of local culture and social life, funerals often become large and difficult to supervise and can therefore quickly get out of control.
Venerating the dead can easily inflame unbelievers to the point of unclean conduct.
At such funerals, there may be loud and unrestrained wailing, embracing of the corpse, talking directly to it as if it were alive, and attaching money and other items to the body.
If this were to happen at a Christian funeral, great reproach would be brought upon Jehovah’s name and his people. ​ — 1 Pet.
1: 14 - 16. Knowing the true condition of the dead should certainly give us the courage to conduct our funerals without any trace of worldliness.
Although Jesus was the greatest and most important man who ever lived, he was buried in a discreet and modest manner.
For those who have “the mind of Christ, ” there is no disgrace in such a burial.
Surely, keeping Christian funerals simple and modest is the best way to avoid what is Scripturally unclean and to maintain a calm atmosphere that is dignified, tasteful, and fitting for those who love God.
Should There Be Rejoicing?
After the burial, it may be the custom for relatives, neighbors, and others to gather in large numbers to feast and dance to loud music.
These funeral celebrations are often associated with heavy drinking and acts of immorality.
Some people reason that such merrymaking helps to take away the sadness of death.
Others feel that this is just part of their culture.
However, many believe that such revelry is a necessary rite of passage that must be performed in order to honor and praise the dead and to release the soul of the deceased to join his ancestors.
True Christians see the wisdom of the Scriptural exhortation: “Better is vexation than laughter, for by the crossness of the face the heart becomes better. ”
Moreover, they know the benefits of quietly reflecting on the shortness of life and the hope of the resurrection.
Indeed, to those who have a strong personal relationship with Jehovah, ‘ the day of death is better than the day of their birth. ’
Therefore, knowing that funeral merrymaking is associated with spiritistic beliefs and immoral activity makes it most inappropriate for true Christians to organize or even attend such celebrations.
Being in company with funeral revelers would demonstrate a lack of respect for God and for the consciences of fellow worshippers of Jehovah.
Let Others See the Distinction How grateful we are to be free from the morbid fear of the dead that is so common among those in spiritual darkness!
As “children of light, ” we express our sorrow and grief in a way that reflects spiritual enlightenment, a way that is modest, respectful, and tempered by the sure hope of the resurrection.
Such a hope will prevent us from being carried away by the excessive displays of grief often seen among those “who have no hope. ”
It will give us the courage to take a firm stand for pure worship, not succumbing to the fear of man. ​ — 1 Pet.
3: 13, 14.
Our faithful compliance with Scriptural principles will give people the opportunity to ‘ see the distinction between those serving God and those not serving him. ’
One day, death will be no more. While we await the realization of that grand promise, may Jehovah find us spotless, unblemished, and completely separate from this wicked world and its God - dishonoring practices. ​ — 2 Pet. 3: 14.

125th Gilead Graduation
Missionaries Encouraged to Be Like Jeremiah
“THIS class of Gilead serves as a historic milestone, ” declared Geoffrey Jackson of the Governing Body.
He was addressing the 6,156 people who were attending the graduation of the 125th class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead on September 13, 2008.
With the 56 graduates from this class, Gilead School has sent out over 8,000 missionaries to “the most distant part of the earth ”! ​ — Acts 1: 8.
Brother Jackson, chairman of the graduation program, asked, “Will credibility enhance your ministry? ”
He then listed four things that build credibility: having the right attitude, setting a good example, basing one’s teaching solidly on God’s Word, and focusing on making Jehovah’s name known.
David Schafer, who serves with the Teaching Committee, discussed the topic “Will You Understand Everything? ”
He assured the Gilead students that they can “understand everything ” needed to serve as missionaries if they continue seeking Jehovah and humbly recognize“ the faithful and discreet slave. ” ​ — Prov.
28: 5; Matt.
24: 45.
Next, John E.
Barr of the Governing Body spoke on the theme “Let Nothing Separate You From God’s Love. ”
Brother Barr’s fatherly counsel relieved the graduates and their parents of any apprehension they might have had about what the new missionaries may face in their assignment.
“Being in God’s love is such a secure, comfortable place to be in our life, ” he explained.
Nothing can separate the missionaries from God’s love unless they separate themselves from God.
Sam Roberson of the Theocratic Schools Department encouraged the audience to fit into “the garment of garments. ”
By studying what Jesus had done and applying it to themselves, the graduates can “put on the Lord Jesus Christ. ”
Next, William Samuelson, overseer of the Theocratic Schools Department, highlighted what makes a person honorable.
It is not man’s view but God’s view that makes one honorable.
Michael Burnett, one of the instructors, interviewed the students regarding their field service experiences.
Although most students were assigned to well - worked territory while in Gilead School at Patterson, New York, they found interested ones.
Gerald Grizzle of the Convention Office interviewed three brothers attending the School for Branch Committee Members.
Their comments helped to prepare the Gilead graduates for what awaits them in their foreign assignments.
The talk “Be Like Jeremiah ” was given by David Splane of the Governing Body, a graduate of the 42nd class.
Although Jeremiah was apprehensive about his assignment, Jehovah strengthened him.
God will do the same for the new missionaries.
“If you are having trouble with someone, ” said Brother Splane,“ sit down and write out ten qualities that you just love about that person.
And if you can’t count the ten, it means that you don’t know the person well enough. ”
Jeremiah was self - sacrificing.
When he wanted to quit, he prayed, and Jehovah was with him.
“When you feel discouraged, ” said Brother Splane,“ talk it over with Jehovah.
You will be surprised at how Jehovah will help you. ”
At the conclusion of the graduation program, the chairman reminded the audience that the graduates have learned several ways to build up their credibility.
As they bear witness in their assignment, their credibility will enhance their testimony. ​ — Isa.

There Is a Time for Everything
“For everything there is an appointed time, even a time for every affair under the heavens, ” says the Bible.
The writer of those words, the ancient wise King Solomon, went on to say that there is a time to be born and a time to die, a time to build and a time to tear down, a time to love and a time to hate.
Finally, he observed: “What advantage is there for the doer in what he is working hard at? ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 3: 1 - 9.
UPON reading those words, some people conclude that the Bible does indeed teach that there is a predetermined time for everything; that is to say, they think that the Bible supports the belief in fate.
Is that really so?
Does the Bible support the notion that everything in life is controlled by fate?
Since “all Scripture is inspired of God, ” what we read in one part of the Bible must harmonize with what we find in other parts of it.
Therefore, let us see what the rest of God’s Word, the Bible, has to say on the matter. ​ — 2 Timothy 3: 16.
Time and Unforeseen Occurrence
Why? He explained: “Because time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all. ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 9: 11.
Rather than suggesting that everything in life is determined by fate, Solomon was pointing out that humans cannot accurately predict the outcome of any endeavor “because time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all. ”
Often, something happens to a person simply because he is in the right place at the right time, or we might say, in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Take, for example, the statement: “The swift do not have the race. ”
You may recall or may have read about the famous, though bizarre, 3000 - meter women’s race in the 1984 Olympics held in Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.
Two runners, one representing Britain and the other representing the United States, were both hoping to win the gold medal.
Halfway into the race, however, they collided on the track.
One fell and was out of the race; the other was so disheartened that she finished seventh.
Was it fate that things turned out that way? Some may say so.
But clearly it was the collision ​ — an accident no one could have foreseen — ​ that caused both of them to lose the race.
Then, was it fate that they collide? Again, some may say so.
Yet, commentators attributed the accident to the intense competition between two strong athletes running a close race, with each trying to dominate.
As the Bible says, “time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all. ”
No matter how well - prepared one may be, there are always some unexpected elements that may affect the outcome of an endeavor, and it has nothing to do with fate.
What, then, does the Bible mean when it says: “For everything there is an appointed time ”?
Is there anything we can do that will affect the outcome of our life ​ — our destiny?
The Best Time for Every Endeavor
Far from speaking about any individual’s fate or describing the eventual outcome of one’s life, the inspired Bible writer was speaking of God’s purpose and how it would affect mankind.
How do we know that?
Basically, that is what the context tells us.
After mentioning many things that appear to have “an appointed time, ” Solomon wrote:“ I have seen the occupation that God has given to the sons of mankind in which to be occupied.
Everything he has made pretty in its time. ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 3: 10, 11.
God has given mankind many occupations, or things to do ​ — Solomon listed a number of them.
God has also given us the free will to choose what we want to do.
However, for every task, there is a time that is right, or favorable, producing the best result.
Take, for instance, Solomon’s statement “a time to plant and a time to uproot what was planted, ” found at Ecclesiastes 3: 2.
Farmers know that for every crop, there is a right time for planting it.
What if a farmer ignores that simple fact and plants a crop at the wrong time or season?
Should he blame it on fate if he does not get a good harvest, even though he has worked hard on it?
Of course not!
He simply did not plant the crop at the right time.
The farmer could have done well had he followed the natural order of things established by the Creator.
Thus, what God has set down is, not the fate of individuals or the outcome of all events, but certain principles that govern the operation of human affairs in line with his purpose.
For humans to enjoy the result of their endeavors, they must discern and work in harmony with God’s purpose and time.
What is predetermined and unalterable is not the fate of individuals but what God has purposed to do.
Through the prophet Isaiah, Jehovah declared: “My word that goes forth from my mouth... will not return to me without results, but it will certainly do that in which I have delighted, and it will have certain success in that for which I have sent it. ” ​ — Isaiah 55: 11.
What, then, is God’s “word, ” or stated purpose, regarding the earth and mankind’s future that“ will have certain success ”?
Understanding God’s Time
Solomon provided a clue. After saying, “Everything [God] has made pretty in its time, ” he went on to say,“ Even time indefinite he has put in their heart, that mankind may never find out the work that the true God has made from the start to the finish. ”
The NIV Study Bible renders this verse: “He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end. ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 3: 11.
Much has been written on this verse.
But the simple fact is that deep down in our heart, all of us at one point or another have wondered about the meaning of life and about our ultimate destiny.
Throughout the ages, people have found it difficult to accept that life consists solely of toiling at the occupations at hand, only to have death end it all.
We humans are unique among all living creatures in that we think not only about the here and now but also about life’s end and beyond.
We even yearn for the possibility of living forever, eternally.
As the scripture explains, God has “set eternity in the hearts of men. ”
To satisfy that yearning, people have grappled with the concept of life after death.
Some conclude that something in us lives on after we die.
Others believe that we will be reborn in endless reincarnations.
Still others think that everything in life is fixed by fate or providence and that there is nothing we can do about it.
Sadly, none of these explanations have been completely satisfactory.
This is because by their own efforts, “mankind [will] never find out the work that the true God has made from the start to the finish, ” says the Bible.
This deep - seated conflict between the desire to know and the inability to find the answer has tormented thinkers and philosophers throughout the ages.
However, since God has put that yearning or desire in our heart, is it not logical to look to him to provide what is needed to satisfy that desire?
After all, the Bible says of Jehovah: “You are opening your hand and satisfying the desire of every living thing. ”
By turning to God’s Word, the Bible, we can find satisfying explanations about life and death and about God’s eternal purpose regarding the earth and the human family. ​ — Ephesians 3: 11.

A Time to Choose
“God proceeded to create the man in his image, in God’s image he created him; male and female he created them. ” ​ — Genesis 1: 27.
THOSE familiar words in the opening pages of the Bible set out one of the grandest things that God “has made pretty in its time ” ​ — bringing into existence a perfect human couple, Adam and Eve.
As their Creator, Jehovah God said to them: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving upon the earth. ” ​ — Genesis 1: 28.
In that statement to the first human pair, God made known his purpose to them. They were to multiply and to care for the earth, turning it into a global paradise home for themselves and their offspring.
There was no predetermined time for them to live and to die.
Instead, God placed before them a marvelous prospect.
By making the right choice and remaining in harmony with God, they could live in perfect peace and happiness forever.
They chose badly, and as a result, old age and death have been the lot of all humans.
In fact, the patriarch Job acknowledged: “Man, born of woman, is short - lived and glutted with agitation. ”
What went wrong?
“Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned, ” explains the Bible.
That “one man, ” of course, was Adam, who deliberately chose to violate God’s simple yet clear command.
By his choice, Adam forfeited his opportunity to live forever on a paradise earth.
He also forfeited for his offspring a precious inheritance and passed on to them the curse of sin and death.
It appeared that everything was lost ​ — or was it?
A Time for Renewal
Millenniums later, the psalmist was inspired to write: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it. ”
As assurance that his Edenic promise will be fulfilled, God’s Word beautifully describes what he will soon do: “He will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.
The former things have passed away. ” Then God himself says: “Look!
I am making all things new. ” ​ — Revelation 21: 4, 5.
Since there is an appointed time for everything, the question that logically arises is, When will that time of renewal come, so that the wonderful promises by God will come true?
The publishers of this magazine, Jehovah’s Witnesses, have been endeavoring to call to people’s attention that we are living in what the Bible calls “the last days ” and that the time for God to take action to ‘ make all things new ’ is at hand.
We urge you to examine the Bible and learn about the wonderful prospects that can be yours.
We also urge you to accept this invitation: “Search for Jehovah, you people, while he may be found.
Call to him while he proves to be near. ”
Rather than being decided by fate, your life and eternal prospects are in your own hands!

Five Reasons to Fear God and Not Man
THE young man was pleasantly surprised.
His discussion with two of Jehovah’s Witnesses had been an eye - opener.
The question of why God permits suffering had bothered him for years, but now it had been clearly answered from the Bible.
He had no idea that the Bible contains so much valuable and heartwarming information.
A few minutes after the visitors left, his landlady stormed into his room and asked angrily, “Who were those people? ”
Taken by surprise, the young man could offer no answer.
“I know who they are, ” she yelled,“ and if you receive them again, you can move out and look for a room elsewhere! ”
She slammed the door and left. Christ’s True Followers Expect Opposition
What this young man experienced is not unusual.
God’s Word, the Bible, explains: “All those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted. ”
True Christians generally are not popular and never have been.
Why not?
The apostle John told his fellow Christians: “We know we originate with God, but the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one. ”
Satan the Devil is also portrayed as “a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone. ”
Fear of man is one of Satan’s most effective weapons.
Even Jesus Christ, who did so much good and committed no sin, was ridiculed and persecuted.
He observed: “They hated me without cause. ”
On the night before his death, he prepared his followers with these words: “If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.
Bear in mind the word I said to you, A slave is not greater than his master.
If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also. ” ​ — John 15: 18, 20.
On this account, many hesitated to take a stand for true worship.
Of those who were looking for Jesus on one occasion, the Bible says: “No one, of course, would speak about him publicly because of the fear of the Jews. ”
The religious leaders of the day threatened to ostracize any who put faith in Christ.
Thus, fear of man prevented many from becoming Christians. ​ — Acts 5: 13.
Later, after Christianity had been established, we read of “great persecution ” against the congregation in Jerusalem.
In fact, throughout the Roman Empire, the Christians faced adversity.
Prominent men in Rome told the apostle Paul: “As regards this sect it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against. ”
Yes, genuine Christians were widely opposed.
Even today, Satan still uses the fear of man as a weapon to hinder many from becoming Christ’s genuine followers.
Sincere people who are studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses face opposition or ridicule in school, at work, in the neighborhood, or in social circles.
They may fear losing respect, friends, or material support.
In some rural areas, farmers fear that neighbors might refuse to help with the harvest or to protect their livestock.
Despite such fears, however, millions have resolved to trust in God and to live according to God’s Word, in imitation of Jesus Christ.
Jehovah has blessed them for doing so.
Why Fear God, Not Man
The Bible urges us to fear God, not man.
It says: “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom. ”
This fear is, not a morbid dread, but a healthy concern over displeasing our Life - Giver.
It is a term that is closely related to love.
Why, though, should we fear God and not man?
Let us consider five reasons.
1 Jehovah is the Supreme One.
Jehovah is far more powerful than any human.
By fearing God, we take a stand on the side of the Almighty, to whom “the nations are as a drop from a bucket. ”
Because God is almighty, he has the power to defeat “any weapon whatever that will be formed against ” those who are loyal to him.
And since he will determine who is worthy to receive everlasting life, we are wise to let nothing stop us from learning about him and doing his will. ​ — Revelation 14: 6, 7.
2 God will help and protect us.
“Trembling at men is what lays a snare, but he that is trusting in Jehovah will be protected, ” says the Bible at Proverbs 29: 25.
The fear of man is a snare because it can cause us to shrink back from professing faith in God.
God assures us of his saving power: “Do not be afraid, for I am with you. Do not gaze about, for I am your God. I will fortify you.
I will really help you. I will really keep fast hold of you with my right hand of righteousness. ” ​ — Isaiah 41: 10.
3 God loves those who draw close to him.
The apostle Paul wrote these touching words: “I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able to separate us from God’s love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. ”
If we learn to trust in and obey God, we can enjoy the unbreakable love of the Universal Sovereign.
What a privilege! 4 We appreciate all that God has done for us.
Jehovah is our Creator, the one who has made life possible.
In addition, he has provided not just the necessities of life but also the things that make life enjoyable and interesting.
Indeed, he is the Source of every good gift. David, a faithful man who appreciated God’s loving - kindness, wrote: “Many things you yourself have done, O Jehovah my God, even your wonderful works and your thoughts toward us...
They have become more numerous than I can recount. ” ​ — Psalm 40: 5.
5 Some who oppose us may change.
You can help those who oppose you by not compromising but holding fast to your fear of God and love for him.
Consider Jesus ’ relatives.
At first, they did not put faith in him, but they said: “He has gone out of his mind. ”
Later, after Jesus ’ death and resurrection, many of them became believers.
Jesus ’ half brothers James and Jude even shared in the writing of the Scriptures.
There was also the fanatic persecutor Saul, who became the apostle Paul.
Some who now cause us trouble may come to see that we have the truth from the Bible because of our courageous stand. ​ — 1 Timothy 1: 13.
For example, Aberash, a woman in Africa, had been praying to find the truth.
After she began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses, she faced fierce opposition from her family members and religious leaders.
Some of her relatives, who had also begun studying, gave in to the fear of man.
But she implored God for strength and courage and was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The result?
Eight of her relatives took courage, resumed their Bible studies, and are making good spiritual progress.
You Can Conquer the Fear of Man
To avoid falling prey to the fear of man, do all you can to strengthen your love for God.
You can do this by studying the Bible and meditating on such texts as Hebrews 13: 6, which says: “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid.
What can man do to me? ”
Do not forget the reasons why fearing God rather than man is the right and wise thing to do.
Keep in mind, too, the many blessings that result from applying what you learn from the Bible.
You can find satisfying answers to life’s important questions.
You can gain practical wisdom to deal with life’s challenges.
You can enjoy a wonderful hope despite today’s perplexing conditions.
And you can approach the almighty God at any time in prayer.
The apostle John wrote: “The world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever. ”
Now is the time to stand firm and walk in the fear of God.
Rather than caving in to the fear of man, you can choose to respond to God’s exhortation: “Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, that I may make a reply to him that is taunting me. ”
What a grand privilege that is!
Remember, no human can give you what God will give to those who fear him: “The result of humility and the fear of Jehovah is riches and glory and life. ” ​ — Proverbs 22: 4.

Because of her courage, eight of Aberash’s relatives continue to enjoy personal Bible studies
The Most Important Date in History
It is the date on which Jesus Christ died.
Why was Jesus ’ death so important?
For a number of reasons.
Jesus ’ faithfulness until death proved that a human could maintain integrity to God.
Christ’s death also provided an opportunity for some from mankind to become corulers with him in heaven.
Additionally, it opened the way for many more to enjoy everlasting life in an earthly paradise.
On the evening before he died, Jesus used unleavened bread and red wine as symbols of his loving human sacrifice.
And he told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me. ”
Will you remember this important event?
Jehovah’s Witnesses warmly invite you to join them in observing the Memorial of Jesus ’ death.
This year the date for the observance is Thursday, April 9, after sundown.
You may attend at the Kingdom Hall nearest to your home. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place.
Keep Your Eyes on the Prize
“I am pursuing down toward the goal for the prize. ” ​ — PHIL.
3: 14. What prize was held out to the apostle Paul?
THE apostle Paul, also known as Saul of Tarsus, came from a prominent family.
He was instructed in his ancestral religion by the famous Law teacher Gamaliel.
Paul had what was considered a fine career ahead of him; yet he abandoned his religion and became a Christian.
He then looked forward to the prize of eternal life that was held out to him ​ — that of being an immortal king and priest in God’s heavenly Kingdom.
That Kingdom will rule over a paradise earth. ​ — Matt. 6: 10; Rev. 7: 4; 20: 6.
2, 3.
How highly did Paul value the prize of heavenly life?
Showing how highly Paul valued that prize, he said: “What things were gains to me, these I have considered loss on account of the Christ.
Why, for that matter, I do indeed also consider all things to be loss on account of the excelling value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.
On account of him I have taken the loss of all things and I consider them as a lot of refuse. ”
The things that most people consider important ​ — position, wealth, career, prestige — ​ Paul considered to be refuse after he learned the truth about Jehovah’s purpose for mankind.
From then on, what really mattered to Paul was the precious knowledge of Jehovah and Christ, regarding which Jesus said in prayer to God: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ. ”
Paul’s earnest desire to attain eternal life is evident in his words recorded at Philippians 3: 14: “I am pursuing down toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God by means of Christ Jesus. ”
Yes, his eyes were focused on the prize of eternal life in the heavens as part of God’s Kingdom government.
Living Forever on Earth
4, 5.
What prize is held out to millions who are doing God’s will today?
For the great majority of those who choose to do God’s will, the prize worth working for is eternal life in a new world of God’s making.
Jesus confirmed that this was a valid hope.
He said: “Happy are the mild - tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth. ”
Jesus himself is the principal one to inherit our earth, as Psalm 2: 8 indicates, and he will have 144,000 corulers in heaven.
Those sheeplike ones who actually will live on earth will “inherit ” the earthly realm of the Kingdom ‘ prepared for them from the founding of the world. ’
And we are guaranteed that this will all come to pass because God, who promises it, “cannot lie. ”
We can have the same confidence in the fulfillment of God’s promises that Joshua had when he told the Israelites: “Not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed. They have all come true for you. Not one word of them has failed. ” ​ — Josh.
23: 14.
Life in God’s new world will not be like today’s unsatisfying existence.
It will be very different: free from war, crime, poverty, injustice, illness, and death.
People then will have perfect health and will live on an earth that has been transformed into a paradise.
That life will be fulfilling and satisfying beyond our fondest dreams.
Yes, then every day will be one of exquisite delight.
What a marvelous prize!
6, 7. (a) How did Jesus demonstrate what we can expect to take place in God’s new world?
(b) How will even the dead be given a fresh start?
When Jesus was on earth, he was empowered by God’s holy spirit to demonstrate the kind of wonderful things that will take place earth wide in the new world. For example, Jesus told a man who had been paralyzed for 38 years to walk.
The Bible reports that the man did so. (Read John 5: 5 - 9.)
In another instance, Jesus encountered “a man blind from birth ” and healed him.
Later, the man formerly blind was asked about the One who had healed him, and he answered: “From of old it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind.
If this man were not from God, he could do nothing at all. ”
Jesus could do all of this because he was empowered by God.
Everywhere he went, Jesus “healed those needing a cure. ” ​ — Luke 9: 11.
Not only could Jesus heal the sick and crippled but he could also raise the dead.
As an example, a 12 - year - old girl had died, causing great sorrow to her parents.
But Jesus said: “Maiden, I say to you, Get up! ”
And she did!
Can you imagine the reaction of the parents and others who were there?
(Read Mark 5: 38 - 42.)
In God’s new world, there will be “great ecstasy ” when billions are resurrected, for“ there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. ”
These will be given a fresh start in life with the prospect of living from that time forward, even forever.
8, 9. (a) During Christ’s Millennial Reign, what will happen to sin inherited from Adam?
(b) On what basis are the dead to be judged?
The resurrected ones are not doomed to failure. Those who come back in the resurrection will not be condemned for sins they committed before they died.
During Christ’s Millennial Reign, as the benefits of the ransom sacrifice are applied, obedient subjects of the Kingdom will grow to perfection, eventually becoming completely free from all the effects of Adam’s sin.
Jehovah “will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces. ”
God’s Word also says that “scrolls [will be] opened, ” indicating that those living at that time will be given new information.
As the earth is transformed into a paradise, “righteousness is what the inhabitants of the productive land will certainly learn. ” ​ — Isa.
26: 9.
Revelation 20: 12 says: “The dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds, ” that is, their deeds following their resurrection.
What a marvelous example of Jehovah’s justice, mercy, and love!
Additionally, the painful things of their past life in this old world “will not be called to mind, neither will they come up into the heart. ”
With upbuilding new information available and a life filled with good things, they will no longer be distressed by the bad things of the past.
Those past experiences can be put out of their minds.
The same will be true of the “great crowd, ” who survive Armageddon. ​ — Rev. 7: 9, 10, 14.
(a) What will life in God’s new world be like?
(b) What can you do to help you keep your eyes on the prize?
In God’s new world, people will be able to live without getting sick again or dying.
“No resident will say: ‘ I am sick. ’ ”
Eventually, the inhabitants of the new earth will wake up each morning to perfect health, thrilled with the prospect of another marvelous day.
They will look forward to satisfying work and association with others who have only their best interests at heart.
Such a life is a wonderful prize indeed!
As a suggestion, why not open your Bible to the prophecies at Isaiah 33: 24 and 35: 5 - 7?
Try putting yourself in the picture.
That will help you keep your eyes on the prize.
Losing Sight of the Prize
Describe the fine beginning of Solomon’s reign.
Once we have learned about the prize, we have to work diligently to keep our eyes focused on it because we could lose sight of it.
For example, when Solomon became king of ancient Israel, he humbly prayed to God for understanding and discernment so that he could judge His people correctly.
(Read 1 Kings 3: 6 - 12.)
As a result, the Bible states, “God continued giving Solomon wisdom and understanding in very great measure. ”
Indeed, “Solomon’s wisdom was vaster than the wisdom of all the Orientals and than all the wisdom of Egypt. ” ​ — 1 Ki.
4: 29 - 32.
What warning did Jehovah give those who would become kings in Israel?
However, earlier Jehovah had warned that anyone who became king “should not increase horses for himself ” and that he“ should also not multiply wives for himself, that his heart may not turn aside. ”
Increasing his horses would show that the king depended upon military might to protect the nation instead of depending on Jehovah, the Protector.
And multiplying wives would be dangerous because some of them could be from surrounding pagan nations that engaged in false worship, and those wives could turn the king aside from the true worship of Jehovah.
How did Solomon lose sight of what he had been given? Solomon did not heed those warnings.
Rather, he did what Jehovah specifically said kings should not do.
He accumulated thousands of horses and horsemen.
He also came to have 700 wives and 300 concubines, many from the pagan nations nearby.
These “inclined his heart to follow other gods; and his heart did not prove to be complete with Jehovah. ” Solomon engaged in the disgusting false worship of the pagan nations that his foreign wives had introduced him to.
As a result, Jehovah said that he would “without fail rip the kingdom away ” from Solomon. ​ — 1 Ki.
11: 1 - 6, 11.
Disobedience by Solomon and by the nation of Israel resulted in what?
Solomon no longer focused on the precious privilege he had of representing the true God. The king became immersed in false worship.
In time, the entire nation turned apostate, resulting in its destruction in 607 B.C.E.
Even though the Jews eventually restored true worship, centuries later Jesus was prompted to declare: “The kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits. ” That is just what happened.
Jesus declared: “Look! Your house is abandoned to you. ”
As a result of its unfaithfulness, the nation lost the great privilege of representing the true God. In 70 C.E., Roman armies devastated Jerusalem and the temple, and many of the remaining Jews became slaves.
Give examples of men who lost focus on what was truly important.
Judas Iscariot was one of the 12 apostles of Jesus.
Judas heard the wonderful teachings of Jesus and saw the miracles he performed with the help of God’s holy spirit.
Yet, Judas did not guard his heart.
He had been entrusted with the money box holding the finances of Jesus and the 12 apostles. But “he was a thief and had the money box and used to carry off the monies put in it. ”
His greediness reached a climax when he plotted with the hypocritical chief priests to betray Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.
Another who lost focus was Demas, who was a companion of the apostle Paul. Demas did not guard his heart.
Paul stated: “Demas has forsaken me because he loved the present system of things. ” ​ — 2 Tim. 4: 10; read Proverbs 4: 23.
A Lesson for Each of Us
16, 17. (a) How powerful is the opposition confronting us?
(b) What can help us to withstand whatever Satan brings against us?
All of God’s servants should take to heart examples set out in the Bible, for we are told: “Now these things went on befalling them as examples, and they were written for a warning to us upon whom the ends of the systems of things have arrived. ”
Today, we are living during the last days of this present wicked system of things. ​ — 2 Tim. 3: 1, 13.
Satan the Devil, “the god of this system of things, ” knows that“ he has a short period of time ” left.
He will do all he can to entice Jehovah’s servants to break their integrity as Christians.
Satan controls this world, including its propaganda channels.
However, Jehovah’s people have something far more powerful ​ — “the power beyond what is normal. ”
We can rely on this power from God to help us withstand whatever Satan brings against us.
Thus, we are urged to pray constantly, confident that Jehovah will “give holy spirit to those asking him. ” ​ — Luke 11: 13.
What attitude should we have toward this present world?
We are also fortified by the knowledge that Satan’s entire system will soon be destroyed but true Christians will survive.
“The world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever. ”
In view of this, how unwise it would be for one of God’s servants to think that there is something in this present system of things that could be of more lasting value than his relationship with Jehovah!
This world under Satan is like a sinking ship. Jehovah has provided the Christian congregation as a “lifeboat ” for his faithful servants.
As they head toward the new world, they can have confidence in this promise: “Evildoers themselves will be cut off, but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth. ”
Hence, keep your eyes focused on this wonderful prize!

Do you visualize yourself attaining the prize when you read Bible accounts?
“Be Vigilant ”
“The end of all things has drawn close....
Be vigilant with a view to prayers. ” ​ — 1 PET. 4: 7.
What was the theme of Jesus ’ teaching?
WHEN Jesus Christ was on earth, the theme of his teaching was God’s Kingdom.
By means of that Kingdom, Jehovah will vindicate his universal sovereignty and sanctify his name.
Thus, Jesus taught his disciples to pray to God: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth. ”
That Kingdom government is very shortly going to bring an end to Satan’s world and then supervise the doing of God’s will throughout the earth.
As Daniel foretold, God’s Kingdom “will crush and put an end to all these [present - day] kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite. ” ​ — Dan.
2: 44.
(a) How would the followers of Jesus know that he was present in Kingdom power?
(b) What else would the sign indicate?
Because the coming of God’s Kingdom was of great importance to Jesus ’ followers, they asked him: “What will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things? ”
A visible sign would be provided in view of the fact that Christ’s presence in Kingdom power would be invisible to those on earth.
That sign would be composed of various features foretold in the Scriptures.
Accordingly, Jesus ’ followers alive at that time could discern that he had begun ruling in heaven.
It would also mark the beginning of the period of time known in the Bible as “the last days ” of the wicked system of things that now dominates the earth. ​ — 2 Tim. 3: 1 - 5, 13; Matt.
24: 7 - 14. Be Vigilant in the Last Days
Why would Christians need to be vigilant?
The apostle Peter wrote: “The end of all things has drawn close.
Be sound in mind, therefore, and be vigilant with a view to prayers. ”
Jesus ’ followers would need to be vigilant, watchful of world events indicating that he was present in Kingdom power.
And their vigilance would take on greater urgency as the end of the present wicked system of things approached.
Jesus told his disciples: “Keep on the watch, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming [to execute judgment on Satan’s world]. ” ​ — Mark 13: 35, 36.
Contrast the attitude of people who are part of Satan’s world with that of Jehovah’s servants.
(Include box.)
People in general are under Satan’s domination, and they have not been watchful as to the meaning of world events.
They do not discern Christ’s presence in Kingdom power.
But Christ’s true followers have been vigilant and have discerned the real meaning of what has happened in the past century.
Since 1925, Jehovah’s Witnesses have recognized that World War I and the events that followed amount to sure evidence that Christ’s presence in heavenly Kingdom power began in 1914.
Thus, the last days of this wicked system of things under Satan had started.
Many observant people, though not knowing the meaning, recognize the dramatic difference between the period before World War I and the period since. ​ — See the box “The Age of Turbulence Began. ”
Why is it vital that we continue to be vigilant?
For nearly a century now, horrendous events taking place around the world testify that we are living in the last days.
There is very little time left before Jehovah gives Christ the command to lead powerful angelic forces against Satan’s world.
True Christians are told to keep on the watch. Hence, it is urgent to continue to do that as we anticipate this system’s end.
We must remain watchful, and under Christ’s direction, we must accomplish a specific work throughout the entire earth.
An Earth - Wide Work
6, 7.
How has the Kingdom - preaching work progressed during the last days?
Jesus described this global work when he enumerated various things that would happen in the time of the end.
Included in his prophecy was this meaningful statement: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come. ” ​ — Matt. 24: 14.
Think of some facts related to that detail of Jesus ’ prophecy. The number of people proclaiming the good news was very small when the last days began in 1914. By now that number has grown to huge proportions.
There are more than 7,000,000 Witnesses of Jehovah preaching throughout the earth, organized into more than 100,000 congregations.
An additional 10,000,000 people gathered with Jehovah’s Witnesses in 2008 on the occasion of the Memorial of Christ’s death.
That was a significant increase in attendance over the preceding year.
Why has opposition not prevented our preaching from being successful?
What a mighty witness about God’s Kingdom is being given in all nations before this system’s end comes!
That is despite the fact that Satan is “the god of this system of things. ”
What, then, accounts for the amazing success of the witness work?
It has to be Jehovah’s backing. Thus, the Kingdom - preaching work proceeds marvelously despite Satan’s attempts to stop it.
Why can our spiritual prosperity be called a miracle?
The success of the Kingdom - preaching work and the growth and spiritual prosperity of Jehovah’s people can be described as a miracle. Without God’s support, which includes his guidance and protection of his people, the preaching work would not be possible.
(Read Matthew 19: 26.)
We can be sure that with God’s holy spirit working on the hearts of vigilant people who are willing to serve, this preaching work will be carried on to a successful conclusion, “and then the end will come. ”
That time is rapidly approaching.
“The Great Tribulation ”
How did Jesus describe the coming great tribulation?
The end of this wicked system will come in what is called “the great tribulation. ”
The Bible does not tell us how long that will last, but Jesus said: “Then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again. ”
When we consider the tribulation that this world has already experienced, such as in World War II when an estimated 50 to 60 million lives were lost, the coming great tribulation will be very severe indeed.
It will reach its climax in the battle of Armageddon. That is when Jehovah will unleash his executional forces to destroy every vestige of Satan’s earthly system. ​ — Rev. 16: 14, 16.
11, 12.
What event signals the start of the great tribulation?
Bible prophecy does not give a date for the first phase of the great tribulation to begin, though it does tell us what extraordinary event will signal its start. That event is the destruction of all false religion by the political powers.
In Bible prophecies found in Revelation chapters 17 and 18, false religion is likened to a harlot who has had immoral intercourse with the political systems of the earth.
Revelation 17: 16 shows that the time will soon come when these political elements “will hate the harlot and will make her devastated and naked, and will eat up her fleshy parts and will completely burn her with fire. ”
When the time comes for that to happen, God will “put it into their [the political rulers ’] hearts to carry out his thought ” to destroy all false religion.
So this destruction can be said to come from God.
It is his judgment against hypocritical religion that for so long has taught doctrines contrary to God’s will and that has persecuted his servants.
The world in general does not anticipate this coming destruction of false religion.
But Jehovah’s faithful servants do. And throughout these last days, they have been telling people about it.
What indicates that the end of false religion will take place swiftly?
It will be a great shock for people to see false religion destroyed.
Bible prophecy shows that even some of “the kings of the earth ” are going to declare regarding that destruction:“ Too bad, too bad,... because in one hour your judgment has arrived! ”
The Bible’s use of the words “one hour ” shows that this event will take place relatively swiftly.
When the enemies of Jehovah finally turn on his servants, how will God respond?
We understand that some time after false religion has been destroyed, there will be an attack on Jehovah’s servants, who have been proclaiming his judgment messages.
When that attack begins, the attackers will have to confront Jehovah, who promises to protect his faithful people.
Jehovah declares: “In my ardor, in the fire of my fury, I shall have to speak....
And they will have to know that I am Jehovah. ”
(Read Ezekiel 38: 18 - 23.)
God states in his Word: “He that is touching you [his faithful servants] is touching my eyeball. ”
So when his enemies begin their global assault on his servants, Jehovah will respond. He will move into action, which will lead to the final phase of the great tribulation ​ — its Armageddon climax.
Under Christ’s command, powerful angelic forces will execute Jehovah’s judgments against Satan’s world.
How We Should Be Affected
How should we be affected by knowing that this system’s end is near?
How should knowing that the end of this wicked system is rapidly approaching affect us?
The apostle Peter wrote: “Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of persons ought you to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion! ”
Those words emphasize the need to keep close watch to make sure that our conduct is in harmony with God’s requirements and that our life includes works of godly devotion, reflecting our love for Jehovah.
Such deeds include doing our utmost in preaching the good news of the Kingdom before the end comes.
Peter also wrote: “The end of all things has drawn close....
Be vigilant with a view to prayers. ”
We draw close to Jehovah and show our love for him by constantly going to him in prayer, asking him to give us guidance by means of his holy spirit and his worldwide congregation.
Why do we need to adhere closely to God’s counsel?
In these perilous times, we need to adhere closely to the counsel of God’s Word: “Keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked. ”
Wickedness is now more abundant than in any other time in history.
Satan has devised many things to prevent people from doing Jehovah’s will or simply to distract them.
As God’s servants, we know this, and we do not want to allow anything to undermine our loyalty to God.
We also know what is shortly going to take place, and we put our confidence in Jehovah and his purposes. ​ — Read 1 John 2: 15 - 17.
Describe how Armageddon survivors will react when the resurrection takes place.
There will come to pass the marvelous promise that God has made to restore the dead to life, for “there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. ”
Notice how emphatic that promise is: “There is going to be a resurrection ”!
There is no doubt about it, for Jehovah has given his word!
Isaiah 26: 19 promises: “Your dead ones will live....
Awake and cry out joyfully, you residents in the dust!...
The earth itself will let even those impotent in death drop in birth. ”
Those words had an initial fulfillment with the restoration of God’s ancient people to their homeland, giving us confidence in the coming literal fulfillment in the new world.
What great joy there will be as resurrected ones are reunited with their loved ones!
Yes, the end of Satan’s world is near, and a new world of God’s making is at hand.
How vital it is that we remain vigilant!

THE AGE OF TURBULENCE BEGAN
The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World is the title of a 2007 book by Alan Greenspan.
For almost 20 years, he was chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Board, which oversees that nation’s entire central banking system.
Greenspan highlights the marked contrast between the world situation before 1914 and what followed:
“By all contemporaneous accounts, the world prior to 1914 seemed to be moving irreversibly toward higher levels of civility and civilization; human society seemed perfectible.
The nineteenth century had brought an end to the wretched slave trade.
Dehumanizing violence seemed on the decline....
The pace of global invention had advanced throughout the nineteenth century, bringing railroads, the telephone, the electric light, cinema, the motor car, and household conveniences too numerous to mention.
Medical science, improved nutrition, and the mass distribution of potable water had elevated life expectancy...
The sense of the irreversibility of such progress was universal. ” But...
“World War I was more devastating to civility and civilization than the physically far more destructive World War II: the earlier conflict destroyed an idea.
I cannot erase the thought of those pre - World War I years, when the future of mankind appeared unencumbered and without limit.
Today our outlook is starkly different from a century ago but perhaps a bit more consonant with reality.
Will terror, global warming, or resurgent populism do to the current era of life - advancing globalization what World War I did to the previous one?
No one can be confident of the answer. ”
Greenspan recalled from his student days a statement by Economics Professor Benjamin M.
Anderson (1886 - 1949): “Those who have an adult’s recollection and an adult’s understanding of the world which preceded World War I look back upon it with a great nostalgia.
There was a sense of security then which has never since existed. ” ​ — Economics and the Public Welfare.
Meyer, published in 2006. We read: “Historic events are often said to have ‘ changed everything. ’
In the case of the Great War [1914 - 1918] this is, for once, true.
The war really did change everything: not just borders, not just governments and the fate of nations, but the way people have seen the world and themselves ever since.
It became a kind of hole in time, leaving the postwar world permanently disconnected from everything that had come before. ”

At Armageddon, Jehovah will unleash powerful angelic forces
Jehovah Deserves Our United Praise
“Praise Jah, you people! ” ​ — PS.
111: 1.
1, 2.
What does “Hallelujah ” mean, and how is it used in the Christian Greek Scriptures?
“HALLELUJAH! ”
That exclamation is commonly heard in Christendom’s churches.
Some people punctuate daily conversations with the expression.
Few, however, know its sacred meaning, and the lifestyle of many who use it dishonors God.
“Hallelujah, ” explains one Bible dictionary, is a“ word used by the writers of various psalms to invite all to join them in praising Jehovah. ”
In fact, a number of Bible scholars point out that “Hallelujah ” means“ ‘ Praise ye Jah, ’ [that is] Jehovah. ”
Understandably, in the New World Translation, the expression found at Psalm 111: 1 is rendered “Praise Jah, you people! ”
A Greek form of this expression appears four times at Revelation 19: 1 - 6 in celebration of the end of false religion.
When that takes place, true worshippers will have special reason to use the expression “Hallelujah ” in a respectful way.
What is the main purpose of our congregating regularly?
The composer of Psalm 111 gives many reasons why Jehovah is so deserving of our united praise.
Verse 1 says: “I shall laud Jehovah with all my heart in the intimate group of upright ones and the assembly. ”
Jehovah’s Witnesses today feel the same way.
The main purpose of our congregating regularly, both in local congregations and at large conventions, is to praise Jehovah.
How can humans search for Jehovah’s works?
“The works of Jehovah are great, searched for on the part of all those delighting in them. ”
Notice the expression “searched for. ”
According to one reference work, the verse can apply to humans who make God’s works “the objects of earnest and devout meditation and study. ”
Jehovah’s creations abound with wonderful purpose.
He set sun, earth, and moon in place, all in proper relation one to another, so that our earth is provided with warmth and light, night and day, the seasons and the tides.
What have advances in man’s understanding of the universe revealed?
Scientists have discovered a great deal about earth’s position in our solar system as well as the perfect orbit, size, and mass of our large moon.
The arrangement and interrelationship of these heavenly bodies makes possible the beautiful and regular change of seasons.
Also, much has been learned about the fine - tuning of natural forces in the universe.
Thus, in an article entitled “The Designed ‘ Just So ’ Universe, ” a professor of mechanical engineering observed:“ It is quite easy to understand why so many scientists have changed their minds in the past 30 years, agreeing that it takes a great deal of faith to believe the universe can be explained as nothing more than a fortuitous cosmic accident.
Evidence for an intelligent designer becomes more compelling the more we understand about our carefully crafted habitat. ”
How do you feel about the way that God made man?
Another great expression of creation is the way that God made us.
When making humans, he gave them a mind, a body with a full set of necessary organs, and the ability and capacity to do work.
There is, for example, the miracle involved in the God - given abilities of speaking and listening, as well as those of writing and reading.
You also have a wondrous masterpiece of construction ​ — the upright human frame.
Why, the design and balance of your body, its mechanical functions and its chemistry, inspire awe.
Beyond that, the amazing nerve connections that enable your mind and your senses to function find no parallel in what scientists have achieved.
In fact, human achievements are possible only because of the mind and senses with which mankind is endowed.
Even the most trained and capable engineer could not have manufactured anything as beautiful and useful as the ten marvelously designed levers ​ — your fingers and thumbs.
Ask yourself, ‘ Could impressive works of art and construction have been made without the skillful use of God - given fingers? ’
God’s Great Works and His Qualities
Why should we view the Bible as one of God’s great works?
Jehovah’s great works include other wonderful things he has done for mankind, as described in the Bible.
That book itself is a harmonious masterpiece.
Unlike any other book, it is indeed “inspired of God and beneficial for teaching. ”
For instance, the first book of the Bible, Genesis, explains how God cleansed the earth of wickedness in the days of Noah.
The second book, Exodus, shows how Jehovah vindicated his Godship by delivering Israel from Egyptian slavery.
The psalmist likely had such events in mind when he was moved to say: “[Jehovah’s] activity is dignity and splendor themselves, and his righteousness is standing forever.
A memorial he has made for his wonderful works.
Jehovah is gracious and merciful. ”
Do you not agree that Jehovah’s activity throughout history, including things done during your lifetime, is a memorial to his “dignity and splendor ”?
8, 9. (a) In what ways do God’s works contrast with many human works?
(b) What are some of God’s qualities that you appreciate?
Notice that the psalmist also stresses Jehovah’s beautiful qualities, such as righteousness, graciousness, and mercy.
You know that the works of sinful mankind are seldom based on righteousness. Often they are an expression of greed, envy, and haughtiness.
That is evident from the fiendish weapons men produce for the wars they foment and for economic gain.
These bring untold misery and horror to millions of innocent victims.
Also, many human works have been accomplished at the expense of the oppressed poor.
An example that many might cite is the use of slaves to build the pyramids. Those mainly served as burial places for the proud Pharaohs.
Moreover, many of mankind’s present - day works not only are oppressive but are “ruining the earth. ” ​ — Read Revelation 11: 18.
How different it is with Jehovah’s works, which are always based on what is right!
His works include the merciful provision for the salvation of sinful mankind.
In providing the ransom, God was ‘ exhibiting his own righteousness. ’
Indeed, “his righteousness is standing forever ”!
As for graciousness, that has been manifested in the patient manner in which God has dealt with sinful humans.
At times, he even used the expression “please ” when pleading with them to turn back from their hurtful ways and do what was right. ​ — Read Ezekiel 18: 25.
Faithful to His Promises
What example of faithfulness did Jehovah set regarding his covenant with Abraham?
“Food he has given to those fearing him.
To time indefinite he will remember his covenant. ”
It seems that the psalmist here referred to the Abrahamic covenant.
Jehovah promised to bless Abraham’s seed and said that they would take possession of the gate of their enemies.
In the initial outworking of those promises, Abraham’s seed became the nation of Israel.
That nation was long enslaved in Egypt, but then “God remembered his covenant with Abraham ” and delivered them.
Jehovah’s subsequent dealings with them show just how generous he is.
He provided food for their bodies and spiritual food for their minds and hearts.
In the centuries that followed, the nation often turned away from God, though he sent prophets to urge them to return.
More than 1,500 years after he delivered the Israelites from Egypt, God sent his only - begotten Son to earth. The majority of the Jews rejected Jesus and allowed him to be executed.
Then Jehovah formed a new nation, a spiritual one, “the Israel of God. ”
Along with Christ, that nation makes up the spiritual seed of Abraham, which Jehovah foretold he would use to bless mankind. ​ — Gal. 3: 16, 29; 6: 16.
How does Jehovah continue to “remember his covenant ” with Abraham?
Jehovah continues to “remember his covenant ” and the blessings promised through it.
Today, he is providing an abundant supply of spiritual food in over 400 languages.
Also, he continues to respond to prayers about our physical needs, in line with the words: “Give us our bread for the day according to the day’s requirement. ” ​ — Luke 11: 3; Ps. 72: 16, 17; Isa. 25: 6 - 8.
Jehovah’s Awesome Power
In what way was ancient Israel given “the inheritance of the nations ”?
“The power of his works he has told to his people, in giving them the inheritance of the nations. ”
One outstanding event in Israel’s history that the psalmist may have had in mind was their miraculous deliverance from Egypt.
When Jehovah finally allowed the Israelites to enter the Promised Land, they were able to conquer kingdoms on the east and west sides of the Jordan River. (Read Nehemiah 9: 22 - 25.)
Yes, Jehovah gave Israel “the inheritance of the nations. ”
What a display of God’s power!
13, 14. (a) What display of God’s power in connection with Babylon might the psalmist have had in mind?
(b) What further great acts of deliverance has Jehovah accomplished?
We are well - aware, though, that despite all Jehovah did in their behalf, Israel did not show respect for him nor for their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
They kept rebelling until God used Babylon to remove them, taking them into exile.
If, as some Bible scholars suggest, the composer of Psalm 111 lived after Israel returned from exile in Babylon, he had further reason to praise Jehovah for His loyalty and power. God showed such by delivering the Jews from Babylon ​ — an empire that had a policy of not releasing captives. ​ — Isa.
14: 4, 17.
Some five centuries later, Jehovah used his power in an even greater way by delivering repentant humans from slavery to sin and death.
One result was that the way was opened for 144,000 humans to become spirit - anointed followers of Christ.
In 1919, Jehovah used his power to deliver a small remnant of these anointed ones from captivity to false religion.
Their accomplishments during this time of the end can only be attributed to God’s power.
Upon proving faithful to death, they will share with Jesus Christ in ruling from heaven over the earth for the benefit of repentant humans.
They will inherit the earth in a far grander way than did ancient Israel. ​ — Matt.
5: 5. Everlasting, Trustworthy Principles
15, 16. (a) What are included among the works of God’s hands?
(b) What orders did God give to ancient Israel?
“The works of his hands are truth and judgment; trustworthy are all the orders he gives, well supported forever, to time indefinite, done in truth and uprightness. ”
Included among “the works of [Jehovah’s] hands ” were two tablets of stone on which were engraved ten important laws for Israel.
These laws, together with all the other regulations that became part of the Mosaic Law covenant, are based on eternal, trustworthy principles.
For example, one of the orders, or laws, on those tablets said: “I Jehovah your God am a God exacting exclusive devotion. ”
It further states that Jehovah exercises “loving - kindness toward the thousandth generation in the case of those who love [him] and keep [his] commandments. ”
The tablets of stone also contained such timeless principles as “honor your father and your mother ” and“ you must not steal, ” as well as the profoundly insightful law against coveting what belongs to others. ​ — Ex.
20: 5, 6, 12, 15, 17.
Our Holy, Fear - Inspiring Redeemer
What reasons did the Israelites have for treating God’s name as holy?
“He has sent redemption itself to his people.
To time indefinite he has commanded his covenant.
His name is holy and fear - inspiring. ”
Again, the psalmist may have had in mind Jehovah’s loyalty to his covenant promise to Abraham.
In line with that, Jehovah did not abandon his people first as slaves in ancient Egypt and later as captives in Babylon.
In both cases, God redeemed his people.
Even if only for those two accomplishments, Israel should have treated God’s name as holy. ​ — Read Exodus 20: 7; Romans 2: 23, 24.
Why do you feel that bearing God’s name is a privilege?
The same is true of Christians today, who have been redeemed from hopeless slavery to sin and death.
We should do our very best to live in harmony with the first request in the model prayer: “Let your name be sanctified. ”
Meditating on that illustrious name should instill in us godly fear.
The writer of Psalm 111 had the correct view of godly fear, stating: “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom. All those doing them [keeping his commandments] have a good insight. ” ​ — Ps.
111: 10.
What will we consider in the next article?
A wholesome fear of God will help us to hate what is bad.
It will also help us to imitate God’s beautiful qualities as shown in Psalm 112, which we will consider in the next article.
That psalm shows how we can qualify to be among the millions who will enjoy praising God forever.
He deserves nothing less. “His praise is standing forever. ” ​ — Ps.
111: 10.
Questions for Meditation
• Why does Jehovah deserve our united praise?
• What qualities of Jehovah are revealed in his works?
• How do you view the privilege of bearing God’s name?

Righteous Ones Will Praise God Forever
“The righteous one will prove to be for remembrance...
His righteousness is standing forever. ” ​ — PS.
112: 6, 9.
(a) What happy future awaits all whom God views as righteous?
(b) What question is raised?
WHAT a marvelous future awaits all humans whom God views as righteous!
Forever they will delight to learn more about Jehovah’s beautiful qualities.
Their hearts overflow with praise as they learn ever more about God’s creative works.
Central to such a glorious future is “righteousness, ” which is emphasized in Psalm 112.
But how can the holy and righteous God, Jehovah, view sinful humans as righteous?
No matter how hard we try to do what is right, we make mistakes, sometimes serious ones. ​ — Rom. 3: 23; Jas. 3: 2.
What are two miracles Jehovah performed out of love?
Lovingly, Jehovah provided a perfect solution. How so?
First, by performing the miracle of transferring the life of his beloved heavenly Son to the womb of a virgin so that he could be born as a perfect human.
Then, after Jesus ’ enemies put him to death, Jehovah performed another outstanding miracle.
God raised Jesus back to life as a glorious spirit creature. ​ — 1 Pet. 3: 18.
Why was God pleased to reward his Son with heavenly life? Jehovah rewarded Jesus with something that his Son did not have in his prehuman existence ​ — indestructible life in heaven.
Jehovah was pleased to do this because Jesus had kept perfect integrity under severe tests.
Jesus thereby provided his Father with the best, yes the complete, answer to Satan’s lie that humans serve God with selfish motives and not out of unbreakable love. ​ — Prov.
27: 11.
(a) Upon his return to heaven, what did Jesus do for us, and how did Jehovah respond?
(b) How do you feel about what Jehovah and Jesus have done for you?
In heaven, Jesus did more. He ‘ appeared before the person of God for us ’ with the value of “his own blood. ”
Our loving heavenly Father graciously accepted Jesus ’ precious offering as “a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins. ”
Therefore, with ‘ cleansed consciences, ’ we can render “sacred service to the living God. ”
What a reason to echo the opening words of Psalm 112, “Praise Jah, you people ”! ​ — Heb.
(a) What must we do to maintain a righteous standing with God?
(b) In what ways are Psalm 111 and Psalm 112 arranged?
For us to maintain a righteous standing with God, we must keep on exercising faith in Jesus ’ shed blood.
Not a day should pass by without our thanking Jehovah for loving us so much.
We also need to keep studying God’s Word and doing our best to live in harmony with its message.
Psalm 112 contains fine advice for all who want to maintain a clean conscience before God.
This psalm complements Psalm 111.
Both open with the exclamation “Praise Jah, you people! ”
or “Hallelujah! ”
and are followed by 22 lines, each line beginning with one of the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet.
A Basis for Happiness
How is the God - fearing “man ” described in Psalm 112 blessed?
“Happy is the man in fear of Jehovah, in whose commandments he has taken very much delight.
Mighty in the earth his offspring will become.
As for the generation of the upright ones, it will be blessed. ”
Note that the psalmist first mentions an individual “man ” and then changes to the plural“ upright ones ” in the latter part of verse 2.
This suggests that Psalm 112 can refer to a composite group made up of many individuals.
Interestingly, the apostle Paul was inspired to apply Psalm 112: 9 in connection with Christians in the first century. (Read 2 Corinthians 9: 8, 9.)
How well this psalm depicts how Christ’s followers on earth today can be happy!
Why do God’s servants need to have a wholesome fear of him, and how should you feel about God’s commandments?
As indicated at Psalm 112: 1, these true Christians experience great happiness as they walk “in fear of Jehovah. ”
This wholesome fear of displeasing him helps them to resist the spirit of Satan’s world.
They take “very much delight ” in studying God’s Word and in obeying his commandments.
That includes the command to preach the good news of the Kingdom throughout the earth.
They strive to make disciples of people of all nations while warning the wicked of the coming of God’s day of judgment. ​ — Ezek.
3: 17, 18; Matt.
28: 19, 20.
(a) How have God’s devoted people today been rewarded for their zeal?
(b) What future blessings await those with an earthly hope?
Because of obeying such commands, God’s servants on earth today now number some seven million.
Who can deny that his people have become “mighty in the earth ”?
And how “blessed ” they will yet be as God carries out his purpose!
As a group, those with an earthly hope will be preserved through the coming “great tribulation ” to form“ a new earth ” in which “righteousness is to dwell. ”
In time, Armageddon survivors “will be blessed ” even more. They will be on hand to welcome back millions of resurrected ones.
What a thrilling prospect!
Eventually, those who take “very much delight ” in God’s commandments will grow to human perfection and enjoy forever“ the glorious freedom of the children of God. ” ​ — 2 Pet.
3: 13; Rom. 8: 21. Wise Use of Riches
9, 10.
How have true Christians used their spiritual riches, and how will their righteousness stand forever?
“Valuable things and riches are in his house; and his righteousness is standing forever.
He has flashed up in the darkness as a light to the upright ones.
He is gracious and merciful and righteous. ”
In Bible times, some of God’s servants were noted for their material riches.
And in another sense, those whom God approves truly become rich, even if that is not in a material sense.
The fact is, in the main, those choosing to humble themselves before God may be poor and looked down upon, as was true in Jesus ’ day.
But whether one has much or little materially, it is possible to be spiritually rich. ​ — Matt.
6: 20; 1 Tim. 6: 18, 19; read James 2: 5. Anointed Christians, along with their companions, do not keep their spiritual riches to themselves.
Rather, they have “flashed up ” in Satan’s dark world“ as a light to the upright ones. ” They do so by helping others to benefit from the spiritual treasures of wisdom and knowledge of God.
Opposers have tried to put a stop to the Kingdom - preaching work but have failed.
Instead, the fruitage of this righteous work will ‘ stand forever. ’
By enduring in a course of righteousness, God’s servants can have the assurance of living permanently, “standing forever. ”
11, 12.
What are some ways that God’s people use the material things they have?
God’s people, both the anointed slave class and those making up the “great crowd, ” have proved to be generous regarding material things.
Psalm 112: 9 states: “He has distributed widely; he has given to the poor ones. ”
True Christians today often make material contributions to fellow Christians and even to neighbors who are in need.
They also use material resources to support relief campaigns in times of disasters.
As Jesus indicated would be so, that is a source of happiness too. ​ — Read Acts 20: 35; 2 Corinthians 9: 7.
In addition, think of the expenditure to publish this magazine in 172 languages, many of which are spoken by people who are relatively poor.
Consider, too, the fact that this journal is made available in various sign languages used by the deaf, as well as in Braille for the blind.
Gracious and Just
Who set the best examples of gracious giving, and how can we imitate their example?
“The man is good who is gracious and is lending. ”
You have no doubt observed that people who give help to others are not always gracious.
Some give in a patronizing or begrudging way.
It is not pleasant to receive help from one who makes you feel inferior or who makes you feel that you are a nuisance or a burden.
By contrast, how refreshing it is to receive help from someone who is gracious.
Jehovah is the outstanding example of a gracious, happy Giver.
Jesus Christ perfectly reflected his Father’s gracious example.
Thus, to be viewed by God as righteous, we give cheerfully and graciously, especially in field service when offering spiritual help to our neighbors.
What are some ways in which we can ‘ sustain our affairs with justice ’?
“He sustains his affairs with justice. ”
As foretold, the faithful steward class cares for the Master’s interests in harmony with Jehovah’s justice.
(Read Luke 12: 42 - 44.)
This is reflected in the Scriptural guidance given to elders, who sometimes have to handle cases of gross sin in the congregation.
The just way of dealing with matters is evident also in the Bible - based direction the slave class provides on how all congregations, missionary homes, and Bethel homes should function.
Justice is required not only of elders but also of other Christians in their dealings with one another and with unbelievers, including in business matters. ​ — Read Micah 6: 8, 11.
Blessings for the Righteous
15, 16. (a) What effect does the world’s bad news have on righteous ones?
(b) What are God’s servants determined to keep on doing?
“For at no time will he be made to totter.
The righteous one will prove to be for remembrance to time indefinite.
He will not be afraid even of bad news.
His heart is steadfast, made reliant upon Jehovah.
His heart is unshakable; he will not be afraid, until he looks on his adversaries. ”
Never before in history has there been so much bad news, including such things as wars, terrorism, new diseases and resurging old ones, crime, poverty, and ruinous pollution.
Those whom God views as righteous cannot escape the effects of this bad news, but it does not paralyze them with fear.
Instead, their hearts are “steadfast ” and“ unshakable ” as they look to the future with confidence, knowing that God’s righteous new world is near.
If disaster does strike, they are better able to cope with the situation because they rely on Jehovah for support.
He never allows his righteous ones “to totter ” ​ — he gives help and strength to endure. ​ — Phil.
4: 13.
God’s righteous ones also have to put up with the hatred and lies spread by opposers, but this has failed to silence true Christians and will continue to fail.
Rather, God’s servants continue steadfast and unmovable in the work Jehovah has given them ​ — to preach the good news of the Kingdom and to make disciples of all who respond.
No doubt, the righteous will experience increased opposition as the end draws closer. Such hatred will reach a climax in the worldwide attack of Satan the Devil in his role as Gog of Magog.
Then, at last, we will ‘ look on our adversaries ’ as they go down in humiliating defeat.
What an experience it will be to see the complete sanctification of Jehovah’s name! ​ — Ezek.
38: 18, 22, 23.
“Exalted With Glory ”
How will the righteous one “be exalted with glory ”?
How enjoyable it will be to praise Jehovah unitedly, without opposition from the Devil and his world!
Such enjoyment will be the everlasting lot of all who maintain a righteous standing with God.
They will not bow down in disgrace and defeat, for Jehovah also promises that the “horn ” of his righteous one“ will be exalted with glory. ”
Jehovah’s righteous one will exult victoriously on seeing the downfall of all enemies of Jehovah’s sovereignty.
How will the concluding words of Psalm 112 be fulfilled?
“The wicked one himself will see and certainly become vexed.
He will grind his very teeth and actually melt away.
The desire of the wicked ones will perish. ”
All who continue to oppose God’s people will soon “melt away ” in their envy and hatred.
Their desire to see an end to our work will perish with them during the coming “great tribulation. ” ​ — Matt. 24: 21.
Of what can we be confident?
Will you be among the happy survivors of that grand victory?
Or if it happens that you succumb to sickness or advanced age before the end of Satan’s world, will you be among “the righteous ” who will be resurrected?
The answer can be yes if you continue to exercise faith in Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice and imitate Jehovah, as do those represented by the righteous “man ” described in Psalm 112. (Read Ephesians 5: 1, 2.)
Jehovah will see to it that the “remembrance ” of such ones will never be forgotten, nor will their righteous acts be overlooked.
They will be remembered and loved by Jehovah forever and ever. ​ — Ps.
112: 3, 6, 9.
The complementary nature of these two psalms is seen in their structure as well as in their content.
God’s qualities extolled in Psalm 111 are imitated by the God - fearing “man ” of Psalm 112, as can be seen by comparing Psalm 111: 3, 4 with Psalm 112: 3, 4.

“The Angel of Jehovah Is Camping All Around ”
As told by Christabel Connell
We became so absorbed in answering Christopher’s Bible questions that neither of us noticed the lateness of the hour; nor did we note that Christopher kept looking out of the window.
Finally, he turned to us and said, “It’s safe to leave now. ”
With that he escorted us to our bicycles and bade us good - night.
What had he observed that was so dangerous?
I WAS born Christabel Earl in Sheffield, England, in 1927.
Our home was bombed during World War II, so I was sent to live with my grandmother while I finished my schooling.
In one convent school that I attended, I kept asking the nuns why there was so much badness and violence.
Neither they nor other religious people I questioned were able to give me a satisfying answer.
After World War II ended, I trained as a nurse.
I moved to London to work in Paddington General Hospital, but in the city, I saw more violence.
Just after my older brother left for the Korean War, I saw a violent fight right outside the hospital.
No one helped the victim, who lost his eyesight as a direct result of the beating.
About this time, my mother accompanied me to spiritualist meetings, but I was still no closer to understanding why there was so much wickedness.
Encouraged to Study the Bible
One day my oldest brother, John, who had become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, came to visit. “Do you know why all these bad things happen? ”
“No, ” I replied.
He opened his Bible and read Revelation 12: 7 - 12.
Now I could see that Satan and the demons are basically responsible for the evil in the world.
So, taking John’s advice, I accepted a Bible study soon afterward.
At that time, however, I let fear of man hold me back from getting baptized. ​ — Prov.
29: 25.
My sister, Dorothy, had also become a Witness.
When she returned from the international convention in New York (1953) with her fiancé, Bill Roberts, I told them that I had studied the Bible.
Bill asked me: “Did you check all the scriptures?
Did you underline the answers in the book? ”
When I said no, he responded: “Then you never studied! Contact that sister, and start again! ”
About that time the demons began to torment me.
I can remember asking Jehovah to protect me and free me from their influence.
Pioneering in Scotland and Ireland
I was baptized on January 16, 1954, finished my nursing contract in May, and began pioneering in June.
Eight months later, I was sent as a special pioneer to Grangemouth, Scotland.
There I felt that Jehovah’s angels were “camping all around ” while I worked in such an isolated assignment. ​ — Ps.
34: 7.
In 1956, I was invited to serve in Ireland.
With two others, I was assigned to the city of Galway.
On the very first day, I called on a priest.
Minutes later, a policeman arrived and took my companion and me to the police station.
When he got our names and addresses, he immediately went to the telephone.
We heard him say, “Yes, Father, I know exactly where they live. ” He was sent by the priest!
Our landlord was pressured to evict us, so the branch office recommended that we leave the area.
We arrived at the railway station ten minutes late.
But the train was still there, and a man was waiting to make sure that we boarded it.
That was after only three weeks in Galway!
We were assigned to Limerick, another city where the Catholic Church exerted tremendous power.
Mobs constantly jeered us. Many people were afraid to open their doors.
A year earlier a brother had been beaten up in the nearby small town of Cloonlara.
So we were happy to meet Christopher, mentioned at the outset, who asked us to return to discuss his Bible questions.
During our visit, a priest walked in and demanded that Christopher make us leave.
Confronting the priest, he said: “These women were invited into my home and knocked before they entered.
You were not invited, nor did you knock. ”
Angrily, the priest left.
Unbeknownst to us, the priest had gathered a large group of men, who were waiting for us outside Christopher’s house.
Knowing they were hostile, Christopher acted as described at the start.
He had us stay until they dispersed.
We found out later that he and his family were soon forced to move out of the area, and they immigrated to England.
Invited to Gilead
I was already planning to attend the 1958 Divine Will International Assembly in New York when I received an invitation to the 33rd class of Gilead.
Rather than returning home after the assembly, I served in Collingwood, Ontario, Canada, until Gilead School began in 1959.
But during the assembly, I met Eric Connell.
He had learned the truth in 1957 and had begun pioneering in 1958.
After the assembly, he wrote to me every day during my stay in Canada and throughout the Gilead course.
I wondered what would happen to us after I graduated.
Attending Gilead was a highlight of my life.
Dorothy and her husband were in the same class.
Their missionary assignment was to Portugal.
To my surprise, I was assigned to Ireland.
How disappointed I was not to be going with my sister! I asked one of the instructors if I had done something wrong.
“No, ” he replied.
“You and your partner, Eileen Mahoney, agreed to go anywhere in the world, ” and Ireland was certainly included in that.
Back to Ireland
I arrived back in Ireland in August 1959 and was assigned to the Dun Laoghaire Congregation.
Eric, meanwhile, had returned to England and was very pleased that I was so near.
He too wanted to be a missionary. He reasoned that since Ireland at the time was a missionary field, he would pioneer there.
He moved to Dun Laoghaire, and we were married in 1961.
Six months later, Eric was in a serious motorbike accident. His skull was fractured, and the doctors were not sure that they could save his life.
After he spent three weeks in the hospital, I nursed him at home for five months until he recovered.
I continued my ministry as best I could.
In 1965 we were assigned to a congregation of eight publishers in Sligo, a port on the northwestern coast.
Three years later, we went to another small congregation in Londonderry, farther north.
One day we returned from service to find a barbed - wire fence across the road where we lived.
The Northern Ireland Troubles had begun.
Gangs of youths burned cars. The city was already divided into Protestant and Catholic areas.
It was dangerous to cross from one area in the city to another. Living and Witnessing Through the Troubles
Our ministry, however, took us everywhere.
Again, we felt as if the angels were camping around us.
When we found ourselves in areas where rioting broke out, we quickly left and returned when things had calmed down.
Once when there was rioting close to our apartment, burning debris from a nearby paint store landed on our windowsill. We could not go to sleep in case our apartment block caught fire.
After moving to Belfast in 1970, we learned that a petrol bomb had, in fact, set fire to the paint store and that our former apartment block had burned down that time.
Another time, a sister and I were out in service and noticed an odd - looking length of pipe on a windowsill.
We walked on. Minutes later, it exploded.
Local people who came out thought that we had set off the pipe bomb! Just then a sister who lived in the area invited us into her house.
Her neighbors accepted this as proof of our innocence. In 1971 we returned to Londonderry to visit a sister.
When we described our route and the barricade we passed through, she asked, “Was no one at the barricade? ”
When we said, “Yes, but they just ignored us, ” she was amazed.
Because during the previous days a doctor and a policeman had had their cars hijacked and burned.
In 1972 we moved to Cork.
Later, we served in Naas, then Arklow.
Finally, in 1987, we were assigned to Castlebar, where we are today.
Here we felt immensely privileged to help build a Kingdom Hall. Eric became seriously ill in 1999. Yet, with Jehovah’s help and the loving support of the congregation, I was again able to cope and nurse him back to health.
Eric and I have attended the Pioneer Service School twice.
He still serves as an elder.
I suffer from severe arthritis and have had both hips and both knees replaced.
Though I have had to face bitter religious opposition and have lived through times of serious political and social troubles, one of my greatest challenges was having to give up driving.
That was a test because it took away much of my independence.
The congregation has helped greatly, being very supportive.
I get around now with the help of a walking stick, and I use a battery - powered tricycle for some longer distances. Together, Eric and I have served as special pioneers for a total of over 100 years ​ — 98 of them here in Ireland.
We have no thought of retiring. We are not relying on miracles, but we believe that Jehovah’s powerful angels are “camping all around ” those fearing him and serving him faithfully.
You Must Not Forget Jehovah
SOME in the group had done something like it before.
For the majority, though, it was the first and only time they would walk across the bed of a body of water without getting wet.
Jehovah had just caused the waters of the Jordan River to be dammed up. Now, in a long, wide procession, millions of Israelites advanced over the streambed into the Promised Land.
Like their ancestors 40 years earlier at the Red Sea, many now crossing the Jordan must have thought, ‘ I will never forget what Jehovah did here. ’ ​ — Josh.
3: 13 - 17.
Jehovah knew, however, that some Israelites would ‘ quickly forget his works. ’
So he ordered Israel’s leader, Joshua, to take 12 stones from the river bottom and deposit them at their first encampment.
Joshua explained: “These stones must serve as a memorial to the sons of Israel. ”
That monument of stones would remind the nation of Jehovah’s mighty acts and impress on them why they should always serve him loyally.
Does that account have importance for God’s people today? Yes.
We too must never forget Jehovah; we must continue to serve him loyally.
Other warnings to the nation of Israel can be applied to Jehovah’s servants today.
Consider Moses ’ words: “Watch out for yourself that you may not forget Jehovah your God so as not to keep his commandments and his judicial decisions and his statutes. ”
That links forgetting Jehovah to willful disobedience.
The danger is real in our day too.
In writing to Christians, the apostle Paul warns against “the same pattern of disobedience ” that the Israelites displayed in the wilderness. ​ — Heb.
4: 8 - 11. Let us consider some events in Israel’s history that will underscore that we should not forget God.
In addition, lessons from the lives of two loyal Israelite men will help us to serve Jehovah with endurance and gratitude.
Reasons to Remember Jehovah
Through all the years that the Israelites were in Egypt, Jehovah never forgot them.
He “remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. ”
What he then did to free them from slavery was truly memorable.
Jehovah struck Egypt with nine plagues. Pharaoh’s magic - practicing priests were powerless to stop them.
Still, Pharaoh defied Jehovah, refusing to let the Israelites go.
The effects of the tenth plague, however, forced that proud ruler to conform to God’s will.
With Moses in the lead, the nation of Israel and a vast mixed company, perhaps totaling 3,000,000 people, left Egypt.
They were not long gone before Pharaoh changed his mind.
He ordered his armed chariots and cavalry ​ — the most powerful army on earth at that time — ​ to recapture his former slaves.
Meanwhile, Jehovah told Moses to take the Israelites to a place wedged between the Red Sea and a ridge of mountains, a seeming dead end called Pihahiroth. ​ — Ex.
14: 1 - 9.
Pharaoh believed that the Israelites had walked into a trap, and his army was about to attack them.
But Jehovah kept the Egyptians back by placing a pillar of cloud and a pillar of fire between them and the Israelites.
Then God split the Red Sea, opening a corridor of seabed with walls of water perhaps as much as 50 feet [15 m] high on each side. Israel began crossing the sea on dry land.
Soon the Egyptians were at the shore, watching the Israelites draw away toward the other side. ​ — Ex.
13: 21; 14: 10 - 22.
A more prudent head would have abandoned the chase ​ — but not Pharaoh.
Brimming with self - confidence, he had his chariots and cavalrymen charge down onto the seabed.
On and on the Egyptians rode. But before they could overrun the Israelite rear guard, their mad chase came to an end. The Egyptian chariots would no longer roll!
14: 23 - 25; 15: 9.
While the Egyptians struggled with their crippled war vehicles, all Israel reached the eastern shore.
Moses now stretched out his hand over the Red Sea. At that, Jehovah made the walls of water forming the corridor collapse.
Millions of tons of water roared in upon Pharaoh and his warriors, drowning them.
None of those enemies survived.
Israel was free! ​ — Ex.
14: 26 - 28; Ps.
136: 13 - 15.
News of this event left surrounding nations with an enduring sense of dread.
Forty years later, Rahab of Jericho told two Israelite men: “The fright of you has fallen upon us,... for we have heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red Sea from before you when you came out of Egypt. ”
Not even those pagan nations had forgotten how Jehovah delivered his people.
Clearly, Israel had even more reasons to remember him.
‘ Safeguarding Them as the Pupil of His Eye ’
After passing through the Red Sea, Israel entered the Sinai Desert, a “great and fear - inspiring wilderness. ”
As they trekked across that ‘ thirsty ground with no water ’ ​ — and no food for such a multitude — ​ Jehovah’s hand was not short.
Moses recalled: “[Jehovah] came to find [Israel] in a wilderness land, and in an empty, howling desert.
He began to encircle him, to take care of him, to safeguard him as the pupil of his eye. ”
How did God care for them?
Jehovah also made water flow “out of the flinty rock. ”
With God’s blessing, their mantles did not wear out, nor did their feet swell up during the 40 years they spent in the wilderness.
What did Jehovah rightly expect of them in return?
Moses told Israel: “Watch out for yourself and take good care of your soul, that you may not forget the things that your eyes have seen and that they may not depart from your heart all the days of your life. ”
If the Israelites gratefully remembered Jehovah’s saving acts, they would always serve him and strive to obey his laws.
What would Israel do?
Forgetfulness Breeds Ingratitude
Moses declared: “The Rock who fathered you, you proceeded to forget, and you began to leave God out of memory. ”
Jehovah’s acts at the Red Sea, his provisions that kept the nation alive in the wilderness, and all the other good things that Jehovah had done were soon ignored or forgotten.
The Israelites became rebellious.
At one point the Israelites reproached Moses because of a supposed lack of water.
Regarding the manna that kept them alive, they complained: “Our soul has come to abhor the contemptible bread. ”
They questioned God’s judgment and rejected Moses as leader, saying: “If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in this wilderness!...
Let us appoint a head, and let us return to Egypt! ” ​ — Num.
14: 2 - 4.
How did Israel’s disobedience affect Jehovah?
Looking back on those events, a psalmist later wrote: “How often they would rebel against him in the wilderness, they would make him feel hurt in the desert!
And again and again they would put God to the test, and they pained even the Holy One of Israel.
They did not remember his hand, the day that he redeemed them from the adversary, how he put his signs in Egypt itself. ”
Yes, Israel’s forgetfulness deeply hurt Jehovah.
Two Who Did Not Forget
Some Israelites, however, did not forget Jehovah.
Two were Joshua and Caleb.
They had been in a group of 12 spies sent out from Kadesh - barnea to explore the Promised Land.
Ten made a negative report, but Joshua and Caleb told the people: “The land that we passed through to spy it out is a very, very good land.
If Jehovah has found delight in us, then he will certainly bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that is flowing with milk and honey.
Only against Jehovah do not rebel. ”
When the people heard those words, they spoke of stoning Joshua and Caleb.
But the two of them stood firm with confidence in Jehovah. ​ — Num.
14: 6 - 10.
Years later, Caleb told Joshua: “Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me out of Kadesh - barnea to spy out the land, and I came bringing him back word just as it was in my heart.
And my brothers who went up with me caused the heart of the people to melt; but as for me, I followed Jehovah my God fully. ”
With trust in God, Caleb and Joshua endured various hardships.
They were determined to remember Jehovah all the days of their life.
Caleb and Joshua also showed gratitude, recognizing that Jehovah had fulfilled his promise of a fertile land for his people.
Yes, the Israelites owed their lives to him.
Joshua wrote: “Jehovah gave Israel all the land that he had sworn to give to their forefathers...
Not a promise failed out of all the good promise that Jehovah had made to the house of Israel; it all came true. ”
How can we today show gratitude like that of Caleb and Joshua?
Be Thankful
A godly man once asked: “What shall I repay to Jehovah for all his benefits to me? ”
So large is our debt to God for his material blessings, his spiritual guidance, and his means of future salvation that eternity will not be long enough for us to repay him.
Actually, we can never repay Jehovah.
But gratitude is within the reach of us all.
Has Jehovah’s counsel helped you to avoid problems? Has his forgiveness helped you to regain a clean conscience?
The benefits from those acts of God last a long time, and so should your gratitude toward him.
A 14 - year - old girl named Sandra faced serious problems but overcame them with Jehovah’s help. She says: “I prayed to Jehovah for help, and his ways of working things out have impressed me.
Now I know why my father often spoke to me about Proverbs 3: 5, 6: ‘ Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding.
In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight. ’
I am sure that just as Jehovah has helped me till now, he will always help me. ”
Show That You Remember Jehovah by Enduring
The Bible emphasizes another quality linked to remembering Jehovah: “Let endurance have its work complete, that you may be complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything. ”
What does being “complete and sound in all respects ” involve?
It involves developing the qualities that will help us to face our trials with trust in Jehovah and with determination to see them through, not giving up.
That kind of endurance brings great satisfaction when tests of faith end.
And they always end. ​ — 1 Cor.
10: 13. A longtime servant of Jehovah who has faced many severe health challenges explains what has helped him to endure: “I try to think of what Jehovah is doing, not what I want to do.
Integrity means keeping my eyes on God’s purposes, not my desires.
When facing problems, I don’t say, ‘ Why me, Jehovah? ’
I simply go on serving him and stick with him even when unexpected trouble comes up. ”
Today the Christian congregation worships Jehovah “with spirit and truth. ”
As a group, true Christians will never forget God the way the nation of Israel did.
But being part of the congregation does not in itself guarantee our personal integrity.
Like Caleb and Joshua, each one of us must show gratitude and endurance in Jehovah’s service.
We have good reason to do so, for Jehovah continues to guide and care for us individually in this difficult time of the end.
Like the monument of stones that Joshua erected, the record of God’s saving acts assures us that he will not abandon his people.
So may you share the feelings of the psalmist who wrote: “I shall remember the practices of Jah; for I will remember your marvelous doing of long ago.
And I shall certainly meditate on all your activity, and with your dealings I will concern myself. ” ​ — Ps.
77: 11, 12.

Focusing on Jehovah’s purposes enables us to endure whatever challenges we face
How Can You Endure in the Ministry?
HAVE you ever felt so drained that you wanted to stop sharing in the preaching work?
Strong opposition, anxiety, poor health, peer pressure, or a lack of tangible results might test our endurance.
Think, though, of the example of Jesus.
He endured the severest of tests “for the joy that was set before him. ”
He knew that by proving that accusations made against God were totally unfounded, he was making Jehovah’s heart rejoice. ​ — Prov.
27: 11.
By enduring in the ministry, you too can make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.
However, what if some obstacles seem to sap you of spiritual energy?
Krystyna, who is advanced in years and is in poor health, admits: “It is not unusual for me to feel tired and despondent.
My age - related problems, such as poor health and anxieties about daily life, can temporarily dampen my zeal. ”
How can you persevere in the ministry despite such obstacles?
Imitate the Prophets
To persevere in the preaching work, faithful Kingdom publishers can strive to have a mental attitude like that of the ancient prophets.
Take, for example, Jeremiah.
When called to serve as a prophet, he was at first reluctant.
Yet, Jeremiah was able to endure in his difficult assignment for over 40 years because he learned to put implicit trust in God. ​ — Jer.
1: 6; 20: 7 - 11.
Henryk draws encouragement from Jeremiah’s example.
He says: “During my more than 70 years in the ministry, I have sometimes been discouraged by the reactions of people ​ — their hostility or their indifference.
At such times, I remind myself of the example of Jeremiah. His love for Jehovah and his strong spirituality empowered him to continue prophesying. ”
Rafał too has been inspired by Jeremiah’s example. He says: “Rather than focusing on himself and his own feelings, Jeremiah relied on God. He carried on undaunted despite widespread animosity.
I try to bear that in mind. ”
Another prophet whose example helps many to endure in the ministry is Isaiah. God told him that his fellow countrymen would not listen to him.
“Make the heart of this people unreceptive, and make their very ears unresponsive, ” said Jehovah.
Was Isaiah doomed to failure?
Not from God’s point of view!
When he was commissioned as a prophet, he said: “Here I am!
Send me. ”
Isaiah stuck to his commission.
Is that how you respond to the command to preach?
To persevere in the ministry despite an unresponsive audience, as Isaiah did, we need to avoid focusing on the negative reactions that we experience.
Rafał deals with discouragement in this way: “I try to avoid dwelling on unkind remarks.
People in my territory have the right to respond any way they want to. ”
Anna adds: “I do not allow my thoughts to linger on anything unpleasant or discouraging.
What enables me to do that is prayer and a consideration of the day’s text before I go out in the field service. Any negative thoughts quickly dissipate. ”
The prophet Ezekiel served among the stubborn Jewish exiles in Babylon.
Had the prophet withheld God’s words from the people and had someone wicked died without hearing the warning, Ezekiel would have been personally accountable.
Jehovah told Ezekiel: “His blood I shall ask back from your own hand. ” ​ — Ezek.
3: 17, 18.
Henryk tries to have an outlook like that of Ezekiel: “I want to be clean from the blood of all men.
Precious human lives are at stake. ” Zbigniew shares the sentiment: “Ezekiel had to press on regardless of what others thought. This helps me to see the preaching work from the Creator’s point of view. ”
You Are Not Alone
You are not alone when you engage in the preaching work.
Just like the apostle Paul, we can say: “We are God’s fellow workers. ”
Krystyna, who admits that she occasionally becomes despondent, says: “That is why I keep begging Jehovah for strength.
He never lets me down. ” Yes, we need God’s spirit to support us in our ministry! ​ — Zech.
4: 6.
When we share in the field service, holy spirit also helps us to display the qualities that constitute “the fruitage of the spirit. ”
That, in turn, helps us to persevere in the preaching work, come what may.
Henryk observes: “Engaging in the field service helps me to work on my personality. I learn to be patient and considerate and not to give up easily. ”
Enduring in the ministry despite various obstacles can help you to cultivate the fruitage of the spirit even more abundantly.
In directing this unique work, Jehovah uses his angels.
The Bible reveals that there are “myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands ” of such spirit creatures.
Under the direction of Jesus, the angels support God’s servants on the earth.
Do you keep that in mind whenever you are in service?
“Meditating on the fact that the angels are with us in the ministry is a source of encouragement to me, ” says Anna.“ I value the help they provide under the oversight of Jehovah and Jesus. ”
What a privilege it is to be able to work with the faithful angels!
How about fellow Kingdom publishers?
No doubt you have experienced the truthfulness of the Bible proverb: “By iron, iron itself is sharpened. So one man sharpens the face of another. ” ​ — Prov.
27: 17.
Working together with others in the ministry provides us with a wonderful opportunity to observe effective methods that may be new to us.
Says Elżbieta, “Working with different publishers provides me with opportunities to show love both to my fellow believers and to the people we meet. ”
Try to share in the ministry with different publishers.
It will make your ministry interesting.
Take Good Care of Yourself
To maintain our enthusiasm in the ministry, we must plan well, have a good routine of personal study, and get sufficient rest.
In other words, we have to take care of ourselves both spiritually and physically.
The Bible says: “The plans of the diligent one surely make for advantage. ”
Zygmunt, now 88 years old, says: “Being systematic in my service helps me to keep it purposeful. I organize my time carefully so as to have enough time for witnessing. ”
Thorough knowledge of the Scriptures strengthens and equips us for the ministry.
Just as we need to take in physical food to keep on going, we must feed regularly on spiritual food to keep sharing in the preaching work.
Feeding on God’s Word daily and taking in “food at the proper time ” can energize us for the ministry. ​ — Matt. 24: 45 - 47.
Elżbieta made fundamental changes in her lifestyle so as to improve in her ministry.
She says: “I have significantly reduced the amount of time I spend watching television so that I have more time to prepare for the ministry.
When I read the Bible each evening, I think about the people I met in the territory.
I look for scriptures and articles that might help them. ”
Getting proper rest will help you to keep your energy level high and can enable you to have a full share in the ministry.
Conversely, an excessive amount of recreation can have a negative impact on the quality of your work.
Andrzej, a zealous publisher, notes: “Lack of rest leads to being overtired, and from there it is just a small step to discouragement.
I do everything I can to avoid that. ” ​ — Eccl.
4: 6.
Despite our earnest efforts, relatively few people come to appreciate the good news.
Jehovah, however, will never forget our work.
Even if many do not want to talk to us, they may speak about our visit after we have left their door.
The effect can be somewhat like what we read concerning Ezekiel: People will “certainly know... that a prophet himself happened to be in the midst of them. ”
To be sure, our ministry is not easy, but we derive tangible benefits from it and the people who listen will too.
“Sharing in the ministry helps us to put on the new personality and to show love for God and our neighbors, ” notes Zygmunt.
“It is a privilege to take part in this lifesaving work. It will never be repeated on this scale or under these same conditions, ” adds Andrzej.
You too can reap abundant blessings from persevering in the ministry today. ​ — 2 Cor. 4: 1, 2.

Questions From Readers
The Scriptures mention “the book of Jashar ” and“ the book of the Wars of Jehovah. ” (Josh.
10: 13; Num.
21: 14) Those two books do not appear in the Bible canon.
Were these inspired writings that have been lost?
There is no reason to conclude that those two books were produced under inspiration and later lost.
Inspired Bible writers referred to quite a few other writings.
Some of those may indeed be parts of the Bible that simply were described in terms unfamiliar to modern readers.
For example, 1 Chronicles 29: 29 mentions “the words of Samuel the seer, ”“ the words of Nathan the prophet, ” and “the words of Gad the visionary. ”
Those three could constitute a collective reference to books we know as 1 and 2 Samuel, or perhaps the book of Judges.
On the other hand, certain references may be to books that have names similar to books of the Bible but that are not actually part of the Bible.
We might illustrate this with four ancient books: “the book of the affairs of the times of the kings of Judah, ”“ the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel, ” “the Book of the Kings of Israel, ” and“ the Book of the Kings of Israel and of Judah. ”
While those names may sound similar to the names of the Bible books we know as 1 Kings and 2 Kings, the four books were not inspired, nor do those books find a place in the Bible canon.
They were likely just historical writings available back in the period when the prophet Jeremiah and Ezra wrote the accounts that we have in the Bible.
Yes, some Bible writers did refer to or consult existing but uninspired histories or documents.
Esther 10: 2 refers to “the Book of the affairs of the times of the kings of Media and Persia. ”
Similarly, to prepare his Gospel account, Luke “traced all things from the start with accuracy. ” He probably meant that he consulted written sources available to him as he compiled the list of Jesus ’ genealogy that we can read in his Gospel.
While the records Luke consulted were not inspired, his resulting Gospel certainly was. And that Gospel remains valuable for us.
As for the two books mentioned in the question ​ — “the book of Jashar ” and“ the book of the Wars of Jehovah ” — ​ they seem to have been existing documents that were not inspired.
Because of that, Jehovah did not see to their preservation.
The Biblical references to those two books lead scholars to conclude that the two were collections of poetry or songs dealing with conflicts between Israel and its foes.
Even some men whom God at times used as prophets or visionaries made records that Jehovah did not inspire or choose to have incorporated in the Scriptures, which are “beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight ” in our day. ​ — 2 Tim.
3: 16; 2 Chron.
9: 29; 12: 15; 13: 22. The fact that certain books were mentioned in the Bible and that they were usable sources should not lead us to conclude that they were inspired.
However, Jehovah God has preserved all the writings containing “the word of our God, ” and these“ will last to time indefinite. ”
Yes, what Jehovah chose to include in the 66 Bible books that we have is just what we need to “be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work. ” ​ — 2 Tim.
3: 16, 17.

Being Born Again ​ — The Road to Salvation?
HOW would you answer the question, “Are you born again? ”
Millions of believers around the globe would answer with an emphatic, “Yes! ”
Sproul, who wrote: “If a person is not born again,... then he is not a Christian. ”
Are you among those who believe that being born again puts you on the road to salvation?
If so, you no doubt want to help your relatives and friends to find that road and to start walking on it.
For them to do so, however, they need to understand the difference between an individual who is born again and someone who is not.
How would you explain to them what it means to be born again?
Many believe that the expression “born again ” refers to someone who makes a solemn promise to serve God and Christ and, as a result, is changed from being spiritually dead to being spiritually alive.
In fact, a current dictionary defines a born - again individual as “a usually Christian person who has made a renewed or confirmed commitment of faith especially after an intense religious experience. ” ​ — Merriam - Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary — ​ Eleventh Edition.
Would you be surprised to learn that the Bible does not agree with that definition?
Would you like to know what God’s Word really teaches about being born again?
You will surely benefit from taking a closer look at this subject.
Why? Because an accurate understanding of what it means to be born again will affect your life and your expectations for the future.
What Does the Bible Teach?
The only place in the entire Bible where the expression “born again ” is found is at John 3: 1 - 12, which describes an intriguing conversation that took place between Jesus and a religious leader in Jerusalem.
You will find that Bible account quoted in full in the accompanying box.
We invite you to read it carefully.
In the account, Jesus highlights several aspects of the “new birth. ”
* In fact, Jesus ’ discussion helps us to answer these five vital questions:
▪ How important is the new birth?
▪ Is it up to us to decide to experience the new birth?
▪ What is its purpose?
▪ By what means does it take place?
▪ What change of relationship does it bring about?
Let us consider these questions one at a time. [Footnote]
[Box / ​ Picture on page 4]
“You People Must Be Born Again ”
“Now there was a man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus was his name, a ruler of the Jews.
This one came to him in the night and said to him: ‘ Rabbi, we know that you as a teacher have come from God; for no one can perform these signs that you perform unless God is with him. ’
In answer Jesus said to him: ‘ Most truly I say to you, Unless anyone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. ’
Nicodemus said to him: ‘ How can a man be born when he is old?
He cannot enter into the womb of his mother a second time and be born, can he? ’
Jesus answered: ‘ Most truly I say to you, Unless anyone is born from water and spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
What has been born from the flesh is flesh, and what has been born from the spirit is spirit.
Do not marvel because I told you, You people must be born again.
The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone that has been born from the spirit. ’
In answer Nicodemus said to him: ‘ How can these things come about? ’
In answer Jesus said to him: ‘ Are you a teacher of Israel and yet do not know these things?
Most truly I say to you, What we know we speak and what we have seen we bear witness of, but you people do not receive the witness we give.
If I have told you earthly things and yet you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? ’ ” ​ — John 3: 1 - 12.
The New Birth ​ — How Important?
THROUGHOUT his conversation with Nicodemus, Jesus emphasized that undergoing a new birth, or being born again, is of great importance.
How did he make that clear?
Note how Jesus in his discussion with Nicodemus underscored the importance of the new birth.
He stated: “Unless anyone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. ”
The words “unless ” and“ cannot ” highlight the necessity of the new birth.
To illustrate: If someone says, “Unless the sun shines, there cannot be daylight, ” he means that sunshine is absolutely necessary for daylight.
In a similar manner, Jesus stated that being born again is absolutely necessary for seeing God’s Kingdom.
Finally, as if to remove any lingering doubt about the subject, Jesus stated: “You people must be born again. ”
Clearly, according to Jesus, being born again is a requirement ​ — a must — ​ for one to “enter into the kingdom of God. ” ​ — John 3: 5.
Since Jesus viewed the new birth as a matter of such great importance, Christians should make sure that they understand this subject accurately.
For example, do you think that a Christian can choose to be born again?
[Blurb on page 5]
“Unless the sun shines, there cannot be daylight ”
The New Birth ​ — A Personal Decision?
WHO causes the new birth? When exhorting their listeners to become born - again Christians, some preachers quote Jesus ’ words: “You people must be born again. ”
Such ministers use these words as a command, in effect saying, “Be born again! ”
They thus preach that it is up to each believer to obey Jesus and take the necessary steps to undergo the new birth.
According to such reasoning, the new birth is a matter of personal choice.
But is that view in harmony with what Jesus told Nicodemus?
A careful reading of Jesus ’ words shows that Jesus did not teach that it is up to man to choose whether to experience the new birth or not.
Why do we say this?
The Greek expression translated “is born again ” can also be rendered“ should be born from above. ”
* Thus, according to that alternate rendering, the new birth originates “from above ” ​ — that is,“ from heaven, ” or “from the Father. ”
Yes, it is caused by God. ​ — 1 John 3: 9.
If we keep the expression “from above ” in mind, it is not hard to understand why an individual cannot cause his own new birth.
Just think of your physical birth.
Was it up to you to make the choice that led to your birth?
Of course not!
You were born because you were begotten by your father. Similarly, we can experience the new birth only if God, our heavenly Father, causes our new birth.
Thus, the apostle Peter rightly states: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for according to his great mercy he gave us a new birth. ” ​ — 1 Peter 1: 3.
Is It a Command?
Some may wonder, though, ‘ If it is true that no one can decide on his own to be born again, why did Jesus give the command: “You people must be born again ”? ’
That does not sound reasonable.
A closer look at that phrase in its original language shows that it is not rendered in the imperative mood, or in the form of a command.
Rather, the phrase is rendered in the form of a statement.
In other words, when Jesus said you must be “born again, ” he was stating a fact, not giving a command.
He said: “It is necessary for you to be born from above. ” ​ — John 3: 7, Modern Young’s Literal Translation.
To illustrate this matter of command versus statement of fact, think of a comparison.
Picture a city that has several schools. One of them is set aside as a school for students belonging to a native, or indigenous, population living in an area far from that city.
One day, a young man who does not belong to that native group tells the principal of that school, “I want to enroll in your school. ”
The principal tells him, “To enroll, you must be a native. ”
Of course, the principal’s words are not a command.
He is not ordering the student, “Be a native! ” The principal simply states the fact ​ — the requirement for attending that school.
Similarly, when Jesus said: “You people must be born again, ” he was simply stating a fact ​ — the requirement for one to“ enter into the kingdom of God. ”
That last thought ​ — the Kingdom of God — ​ has a bearing on yet another aspect of the new birth.
Knowing the answer to that question is a key to understanding accurately what it means to be born again.
Several Bible translations render John 3: 3 in this way.
For example, A Literal Translation of the Bible states: “If one does not receive birth from above, he is not able to see the kingdom of God. ”
[Picture on page 6]
What similarity is there between the new birth and a physical birth?
The New Birth ​ — What Is Its Purpose?
MANY believe that one needs to be born again to receive eternal salvation.
Note, though, what Jesus himself said about the purpose of the new birth.
He stated: “Unless anyone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. ”
Thus, one needs to be born again in order to enter into God’s Kingdom, not in order to receive salvation.
To understand the difference, let us consider first the meaning of the expression “kingdom of God. ”
A kingdom is a form of government.
So, then, the expression “kingdom of God ” means“ government of God. ”
The Bible teaches that Jesus Christ, the “son of man, ” is the King of God’s Kingdom and that Christ has fellow rulers.
Furthermore, a vision given to the apostle John disclosed that Christ’s fellow rulers are individuals chosen “out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation ” and will“ rule as kings over the earth. ”
God’s Word further reveals that those who will rule as kings form a “little flock ” of 144,000 individuals“ who have been bought from the earth. ” ​ — Luke 12: 32; Revelation 14: 1, 3.
Where is the seat of God’s Kingdom?
“The kingdom of God ” is also called“ the kingdom of the heavens, ” which shows that Jesus and his fellow kings rule from heaven.
Thus, God’s Kingdom is a heavenly government made up of Jesus Christ and a group of fellow rulers chosen from among mankind.
What, then, did Jesus mean when he stated that one must be born again to “enter into the kingdom of God ”?
He meant that one needs to be born again in order to become a ruler with Christ in heaven.
Simply put, the purpose of the new birth is to prepare a limited group of humans for heavenly rulership.
Thus far, we have seen that the new birth is of great importance, is initiated by God, and is preparing a group of humans for rulership in heaven.
But how does the new birth actually take place?

The New Birth ​ — How Does It Take Place?
JESUS spoke with Nicodemus not only about the importance, cause, and purpose of the new birth but also about the means by which the new birth occurs.
Jesus said: “Unless anyone is born from water and spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. ”
Thus, a person is born again by means of water and spirit.
But to what does the expression “water and spirit ” refer?
“Water and Spirit ” ​ — What Are They?
Being a Jewish religious scholar, Nicodemus was no doubt familiar with the way that the Hebrew Scriptures use the term “spirit of God ” ​ — God’s active force, which can influence people to perform special feats.
So when Jesus used the word “spirit, ” Nicodemus would have understood it to be the holy spirit, the active force of God.
What about Jesus ’ reference to water?
Consider the events that are recorded immediately before and after the conversation with Nicodemus.
These show that both John the Baptizer and Jesus ’ disciples were performing baptisms in water.
This practice became well - known in Jerusalem. Therefore, when Jesus spoke about water, Nicodemus would have discerned that Jesus was referring, not to water in general, but to the water of baptism.
* Baptized “With Holy Spirit ”
If being “born from water ” relates to being baptized in water, what does it mean to be“ born from... spirit ”?
Before Nicodemus ’ conversation with Jesus, John the Baptizer had announced that not only water but also spirit would play a role in baptism.
He said: “I baptized you with water, but he [Jesus] will baptize you with holy spirit. ”
Gospel writer Mark describes the first time that such a baptism took place.
He writes: “In the course of those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.
And immediately on coming up out of the water he saw the heavens being parted, and, like a dove, the spirit coming down upon him. ”
When Jesus was immersed in the Jordan, he was baptized with water.
At the moment that he received the spirit from heaven, he was baptized with holy spirit.
About three years after his baptism, Jesus assured his disciples: “You will be baptized in holy spirit not many days after this. ”
When did that occur?
On the day of Pentecost in the year 33 C.E., about 120 disciples of Jesus were gathered in a home in Jerusalem.
“Suddenly there occurred from heaven a noise just like that of a rushing stiff breeze, and it filled the whole house in which they were sitting.
And tongues as if of fire became visible to them..., and they all became filled with holy spirit. ”
That same day, others in Jerusalem were urged to get baptized in water.
The apostle Peter told a crowd: “Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit. ”
What was the reaction?
“Those who embraced his word heartily were baptized, and on that day about three thousand souls were added. ” ​ — Acts 2: 38, 41.
A Twofold Process
They show that the new birth takes place by means of a twofold process.
Note that Jesus first got baptized with water.
Then he received the holy spirit.
Similarly, the early disciples had first been baptized in water (some by John the Baptizer), and then they received the holy spirit.
Likewise, the 3,000 converts were first baptized with water, and then they received the holy spirit.
Keeping in mind the baptisms that occurred on Pentecost 33 C.E., how should we expect the new birth to take place today?
In the same way that it occurred in the case of Jesus ’ apostles and early disciples.
First, a person repents of his sins, turns away from a wrong course, dedicates his life to Jehovah to worship and serve him, and makes his dedication public by water baptism.
Then, if God chooses him to serve as a ruler in His Kingdom, he is anointed with holy spirit.
The first part of this twofold process (baptism with water) is initiated by the individual; the second part (baptism with spirit) is initiated by God.
When a person undergoes both baptisms, he has experienced the new birth.
Why, though, did Jesus in his conversation with Nicodemus use the expression “born from water and spirit ”?
To underline that those baptized with water and spirit would undergo a remarkable change.
The next article considers that aspect of the new birth.
[Picture on page 9]
John baptized repentant Israelites with water
The New Birth ​ — What Does It Accomplish?
WHY did Jesus use the expression “born... from spirit ” when speaking about the baptism with holy spirit?
Hence, the term “new birth ” indicates a“ new beginning. ”
Therefore, the figures of speech “born ” and“ new birth ” highlight that there will be a new beginning in the relationship between God and those who are baptized with holy spirit.
How does that complete change in relationship occur?
In explaining how God prepares humans for rulership in heaven, the apostle Paul used an illustration taken from family life.
He wrote to Christians in his day that they would experience an “adoption as sons ” and that God, therefore, could deal with them“ as with sons. ”
A Change Caused by Adoption In the illustration, the young man is unable to enroll in the school because he is not a member of the indigenous population.
Now, imagine that one day, a big change occurs. He is legally adopted by a father of an indigenous family.
How does that affect the young man?
Well, because of being adopted as a son, he may now have the same rights as other indigenous youths ​ — including the right to enroll in the school.
This illustrates what happens in a much more significant manner to those who experience the new birth. Consider some similarities. The young man in the illustration will be given a place in school but only if he meets the requirement for admission ​ — that of belonging to the native population.
Yet, on his own he cannot meet that requirement.
Similarly, some humans will be given a place in God’s Kingdom, or heavenly government, but only if they meet the requirement for admission ​ — that of being “born again. ”
Yet, on their own they cannot meet that requirement because the new birth depends on God.
The legal process of adoption. Of course, that process did not change the young man’s nature. After his adoption, he was still the same person.
Even so, after the legal requirements for adoption had been met, the young man received a new status.
Indeed, he experienced a new beginning ​ — a new birth, so to speak.
He became a son, which gave him the right to attend the school and to be part of his adoptive father’s family.
Similarly, Jehovah changed the condition of a group of imperfect humans by initiating a legal procedure to adopt them as his children.
The apostle Paul, who belonged to that group, wrote to fellow believers: “You received a spirit of adoption as sons, by which spirit we cry out: ‘ Abba, Father! ’
The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God’s children. ”
Yes, through the process of adoption, those Christians had become part of God’s family, or “children of God. ” ​ — 1 John 3: 1; 2 Corinthians 6: 18.
Of course, that adoption by God did not change the nature of the adoptees, for they remained imperfect.
Nevertheless, as Paul further explained, after the legal requirements for adoption had been met, they received a new status.
At the same time, God’s spirit implanted in those adopted sons the conviction that they would live with Christ in heaven.
That unmistakable conviction caused by holy spirit gave them a whole new outlook on life.
Yes, they experienced a new beginning ​ — a new birth, as it were.
Speaking about God’s adopted sons, the Bible states: “They will be priests of God and of the Christ, and will rule as kings with him for the thousand years. ”
With Christ, God’s adopted sons will receive a place as kings in God’s Kingdom, or heavenly government.
The apostle Peter told fellow believers that they would receive “an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance ” that is“ reserved in the heavens ” for them.
A precious inheritance indeed!
However, this matter of rulership also raises a question. If those who are born again will rule as kings in heaven, over whom will they be ruling?
That question will be considered in the following article.
[Picture on page 10]
What did Paul say about adoption?
Rulership for Some, Benefits for Many
SINCE the days of the apostles, God has been choosing from among mankind a limited number of faithful Christians, adopting them as sons.
The change that these adopted sons experience is so complete that God’s Word describes it as a new birth.
The purpose of the new birth is to prepare such born - again servants of God to become rulers in heaven.
To become rulers, they are raised out of death to heavenly life.
In heaven, “they are to rule as kings over the earth ” along with Christ. ​ — Revelation 5: 10; 11: 15.
However, God’s Word also states that others besides those who are born again will receive everlasting salvation.
In the Bible (in the Hebrew Scriptures as well as in the Christian Greek Scriptures), mention is made of the fact that God purposed to save two groups of people ​ — a comparatively small group of rulers living in heaven and a large group of subjects living on earth.
Note, for example, what the apostle John wrote to fellow believers who had experienced the new birth. He stated regarding Jesus: “He is a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins, yet not for ours [the small group] only but also for the whole world’s [the large group]. ” ​ — 1 John 2: 2.
Similarly, the apostle Paul wrote: “The eager expectation of the creation [the large group] is waiting for the revealing of the sons of God [the small group]. ”
How should these words of the apostles John and Paul be understood?
In this way: Those who are born again will become part of a government in heaven. For what purpose?
To bring everlasting benefits to untold millions of people, subjects of God’s government who will be living on earth.
Therefore, Jesus taught his disciples to pray: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth. ” ​ — Matthew 6: 10.
This same truth regarding salvation being extended to two groups is also found in the Hebrew Scriptures.
Note, for instance, what Jehovah told Jesus ’ forefather Abraham: “By means of your seed [the small group] all nations of the earth [the large group] will certainly bless themselves. ”
Yes, blessings were to be made available to all nations through Abraham’s “seed. ”
Who is that “seed ”?
Jesus Christ, joined by those who experienced the new birth, the adopted sons of God.
The apostle Paul explains: “If you belong to Christ, you are really Abraham’s seed. ”
And what are the blessings that come to people of all nations through the “seed ”?
The privilege of being restored to God’s favor and enjoying life without end on a paradise earth.
The psalmist David prophesied: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it. ” ​ — Psalm 37: 29; Isaiah 45: 18; Revelation 21: 1 - 5.
Indeed, rulership in heaven is set aside for some, but the benefits of heavenly rulership ​ — everlasting life on earth and all its accompanying blessings — ​ are extended to many.
May you and your family be among those who will reap the everlasting benefits that God’s Kingdom will bring.
[Picture on page 12]
Untold millions will be blessed with everlasting life on earth.
Will you be among them?
Draw Close to God
The Father of Fatherless Boys
Exodus 22: 22 - 24
“A FATHER of fatherless boys... is God in his holy dwelling. ”
Those inspired words convey a touching lesson about Jehovah God ​ — he is sensitive to the needs of disadvantaged ones.
His concern for children who lose a parent in death was clearly evident in the Law he gave to Israel.
Let us examine the Bible’s first reference to the “fatherless boy, ” * found at Exodus 22: 22 - 24.
God warns: “You people must not afflict any... fatherless boy. ” This was not a mere plea for humanitarianism; it was a divine command.
A child who lost his father ​ — and hence his protector and sustainer — ​ was vulnerable. No one was to “afflict ” such a child in any way.
In other Bible translations, the word “afflict ” is rendered“ abuse, ” “mistreat, ” and“ take advantage of. ”
To wrong a fatherless child was a serious matter in God’s eyes. Just how serious?
The Law continues: “If you should afflict him at all, then if he cries out to me at all, I shall unfailingly hear his outcry. ” The account switches from the plural“ you ” in verse 22 to the singular “you ” in verse 23.
The individual and the nation as a whole were equally responsible for obeying this divine precept.
Jehovah was watching; he inclined his ear to the fatherless boys, ever ready to respond to their cries for help. ​ — Psalm 10: 14; Proverbs 23: 10, 11.
What, then, would happen if someone were to wrong a fatherless boy, giving that child reason to cry out to God?
“My anger will indeed blaze, ” says Jehovah,“ and I shall certainly kill you with the sword. ”
One Bible reference work says that this “is literally ‘ and my nose will become hot, ’ which is an idiom for intense anger. ” Notice that Jehovah did not leave it up to the human judges in Israel to enforce this law.
God himself would execute judgment upon anyone who took advantage of a defenseless child. ​ — Deuteronomy 10: 17, 18. Jehovah has not changed.
His heart goes out to children who lack a parent or parents.
Those who would seek to exploit a vulnerable child will not escape “the burning anger of Jehovah. ”
Such wicked ones will learn that “it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. ” ​ — Hebrews 10: 31.
[Footnote] The expression “fatherless boy ” appears some 40 times in the Bible. Although the Hebrew word thus rendered is in the masculine gender, we should not think that the principles underlying such statements excluded girls who lost a father.
The Mosaic Law upheld the rights of fatherless girls as well. ​ — Numbers 27: 1 - 8.

Jehovah’s Wisdom Observed in Creation
“His invisible qualities are... perceived by the things made. ” ​ — ROM.
1: 20. What effect has worldly wisdom had on many today?
THE word “wisdom ” is used loosely. Some say that a person is wise if he has merely accumulated a wealth of knowledge.
However, the world’s so - called intellectuals offer no trustworthy guidance for finding true meaning in life.
On the contrary, those who allow themselves to be influenced by such ones end up being “tossed about as by waves and carried hither and thither by every wind of teaching. ” ​ — Eph.
4: 14. 2, 3. (a) Why is Jehovah “wise alone ”?
(b) How does godly wisdom differ from the wisdom of the world?
How different it is with those who acquire true wisdom, the Source of which is Jehovah God!
The Bible tells us that Jehovah is “wise alone. ”
He knows all that there is to know about the universe, including its composition and its history.
The physical laws of nature ​ — upon which humans rely for their research — ​ are all of Jehovah’s making.
Thus, he is not impressed by man - made inventions, and he is not intrigued by the so - called elevated thinking of human philosophy.
“The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. ” ​ — 1 Cor.
3: 19.
The Bible tells us that Jehovah “gives wisdom ” to his servants.
Rather, it lays emphasis on sound judgment and is based on accurate knowledge and understanding. (Read James 3: 17.)
The apostle Paul marveled at Jehovah’s wisdom.
He wrote: “O the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge!
How unsearchable his judgments are and past tracing out his ways are! ”
Because Jehovah is all - wise, we are confident that his laws guide us in the best way of living.
After all, Jehovah knows more than anyone else what we need in order to be happy. ​ — Prov.
3: 5, 6.
Jesus ​ — “A Master Worker ”
What is one way in which we can discern Jehovah’s wisdom?
Jehovah’s wisdom, along with his other matchless qualities, can be observed in the things he made. (Read Romans 1: 20.)
From the largest to the smallest, Jehovah’s works reveal aspects of his personality.
No matter where we look ​ — to the heavens above or to the soil beneath our feet — ​ we find abundant evidence of an all - wise and loving Creator.
We can learn much about him by considering the things that he has made. ​ — Ps.
19: 1; Isa.
40: 26.
5, 6. (a) Besides Jehovah, who was involved in creation?
(b) What will we consider, and why?
Jehovah was not alone when he “created the heavens and the earth. ”
The Bible indicates that long before physical creation began, he created a spirit person by means of whom he formed “all other things. ”
That spirit creature was God’s only - begotten Son ​ — “the firstborn of all creation ” — ​ who later lived on earth as the man Jesus.
Like Jehovah, Jesus possesses wisdom.
In fact, in Proverbs chapter 8, he is represented as wisdom personified. That Bible chapter also refers to Jesus as God’s “master worker. ” ​ — Prov.
8: 12, 22 - 31.
Thus, the physical creation reveals the wisdom both of Jehovah and of his Master Worker, Jesus.
It contains valuable lessons for us.
Let us consider four examples of created things that are described at Proverbs 30: 24 - 28 as “instinctively wise. ”
A Lesson in Industriousness
7, 8.
What facts about the ant fascinate you?
When we examine their design and activities, even the things that can be called “the smallest of the earth ” provide lessons for us.
For example, consider the instinctive wisdom of the ant. ​ — Read Proverbs 30: 24, 25.
Some researchers believe that for every human there are at least 200,000 ants, all of them busily toiling on and under the earth’s surface.
Ants are organized into colonies, and in most colonies three types of ants can be found: queens, males, and workers.
Each group contributes in its own way to caring for the colony’s needs.
One particular ant, the South American leaf - cutting ant, could be called a sophisticated gardener. This little insect fertilizes, transplants, and prunes its fungus gardens in ways that maximize yield.
Researchers have found that this skillful “gardener ” adjusts its efforts according to the amount of food that is needed by the colony.
9, 10.
How can we imitate the ant’s industriousness?
We can learn from the ants.
They teach us that diligent effort is needed if we wish to produce good fruitage.
The Bible tells us: “Go to the ant, you lazy one; see its ways and become wise.
Although it has no commander, officer or ruler, it prepares its food even in the summer; it has gathered its food supplies even in the harvest. ”
Both Jehovah and his Master Worker, Jesus, are industrious.
“My Father has kept working until now, ” said Jesus,“ and I keep working. ” ​ — John 5: 17.
As imitators of God and of Christ, we too should be industrious.
No matter what our assignment in God’s organization, all of us should have “plenty to do in the work of the Lord. ”
Therefore, we do well to follow Paul’s admonition to the Christians in Rome: “Do not loiter at your business. Be aglow with the spirit. Slave for Jehovah. ”
Our efforts in doing Jehovah’s will are not in vain, for the Bible assures us: “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name. ” ​ — Heb.
6: 10. Protection From Spiritual Harm
Describe some characteristics of the rock badger.
The rock badger is another comparatively small creature that can teach us important lessons. (Read Proverbs 30: 26.)
It somewhat resembles a large rabbit but has short, rounded ears and short legs.
This little animal lives in rocky areas. The keen eyesight of the rock badger serves it well, and the holes and crevices in its craggy habitat provide a safe retreat from predators.
The rock badger is designed to prosper in a close - knit community, which provides protection and helps it to keep warm in winter.
12, 13.
What lessons can we learn from the rock badger?
What can we learn from the rock badger?
First, note that this animal does not leave itself vulnerable to attack.
Rather, it takes advantage of its keen eyesight to see predators from afar, and it stays close to holes and crevices that can provide lifesaving shelter.
Similarly, we need to have sharp spiritual vision so that we can perceive the dangers that lurk in Satan’s world.
The apostle Peter admonished Christians: “Keep your senses, be watchful.
Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone. ”
When he was on earth, Jesus remained watchful, on guard against all attempts of Satan to break His integrity.
Jesus set a good example for his followers!
One way we can be watchful is by taking advantage of the spiritual protection that Jehovah makes available to us.
Study of God’s Word and attendance at Christian meetings should not be neglected.
Furthermore, just as the rock badger thrives in a close - knit community, we need to stay close to our fellow Christians so that we can enjoy “an interchange of encouragement ” with them.
By availing ourselves of the protection Jehovah provides, we show that we agree with the psalmist David, who wrote: “Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold and the Provider of escape for me.
My God is my rock. I shall take refuge in him. ” ​ — Ps.
18: 2.
Persevering Despite Opposition
Although a single locust may not be impressive, what can be said of a locust swarm?
We can also learn from the locust.
A single locust, measuring only about two inches [5 cm] in length, may not inspire awe, but a swarm of locusts certainly does. (Read Proverbs 30: 27.)
Known for having a voracious appetite, a swarm of these relentless insects can quickly denude a field ready for harvest.
The Bible compares the sound of an approaching swarm of insects, including locusts, to the rumble of chariots and to the crackling of flames consuming stubble.
Men have built fires in an effort to check the advance of a locust swarm, but these are usually ineffective.
Even without a king or a leader, a locust swarm operates like a well - organized army, overcoming virtually any obstacle.
* ​ — Joel 2: 25.
15, 16.
How are modern - day Kingdom proclaimers like a locust swarm?
The prophet Joel compared the activity of Jehovah’s servants to the actions of locusts.
He wrote: “Like powerful men they run. Like men of war they go up a wall.
And they go each one in his own ways, and they do not alter their paths.
And one another they do not shove. As an able - bodied man in his course, they keep going; and should some fall even among the missiles, the others do not break off course. ” ​ — Joel 2: 7, 8.
How well this prophecy describes modern - day proclaimers of God’s Kingdom!
No “wall ” of opposition has been able to stop their preaching.
Rather, they imitate Jesus, who persisted in doing God’s will even though he was despised by many.
True, some Christians have ‘ fallen among the missiles ’ by being put to death as martyrs for their faith.
Still, the preaching work has continued, and the number of Kingdom proclaimers keeps growing. In fact, persecution has often served to spread the good news to people who would not otherwise have heard the Kingdom message.
In your personal ministry, have you demonstrated perseverance like that of the locust ​ — even in the face of indifference and opposition? ​ — Heb.
10: 39. “Cling to What Is Good ”
Why do the feet of a gecko adhere to smooth surfaces?
The tiny gecko lizard seems to defy gravity. (Read Proverbs 30: 28.)
In fact, scientists are awed by the ability of this little creature to scurry up walls and even across smooth ceilings without falling.
How does the gecko do it?
The secret is not in suction cups or in some type of glue.
Instead, each of the gecko’s toes has a pad with ridges that contain thousands of hairlike protrusions.
Each of these protrusions, in turn, has hundreds of filaments with saucer - shaped tips.
Intrigued by the gecko’s ability, researchers say that synthetic materials made to imitate the gecko’s feet could be used as a powerful adhesive.
How can we make sure that we always “cling to what is good ”?
What can we learn from the gecko?
The Bible admonishes us: “Abhor what is wicked, cling to what is good. ”
The unwholesome influences that are prevalent in Satan’s world could cause us to lose our grip on godly principles.
For instance, association with those who do not adhere to God’s laws ​ — whether at school or at work or through some form of ungodly entertainment — ​ might affect our determination to do what is right.
Do not let that happen to you! God’s Word warns: “Do not become wise in your own eyes. ”
Instead, follow the wise counsel that Moses gave to God’s people in ancient times: “Jehovah your God you should fear.
Him you should serve, and to him you should cling. ”
By clinging to Jehovah, we will be imitating Jesus, of whom it was said: “You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness. ” ​ — Heb.
1: 9.
Lessons From Creation
(a) What qualities of Jehovah do you perceive in creation?
(b) How can godly wisdom benefit us?
As we have seen, Jehovah’s qualities are clearly perceived in the things he made, and his creations also provide valuable lessons for us.
The more we explore Jehovah’s works, the more we marvel at his wisdom.
Paying attention to godly wisdom will deepen our happiness now and safeguard us in times to come.
Yes, we will personally experience the truthfulness of the assurance found at Proverbs 3: 13, 18, which states: “Happy is the man that has found wisdom, and the man that gets discernment.
It is a tree of life to those taking hold of it, and those keeping fast hold of it are to be called happy. ”

Job Held High the Name of Jehovah
“Let the name of Jehovah continue to be blessed. ” ​ — JOB 1: 21.
Who likely wrote the book of Job, and when?
MOSES was about 40 years old when he fled from Egypt to escape the wrath of Pharaoh and took up residence in Midian.
During his stay in that land, he could have heard of the trials of Job, who was living nearby in the land of Uz.
Years later, when Moses and the nation of Israel were near Uz toward the end of their wilderness journey, Moses may have learned about Job’s final years.
Jewish tradition holds that Moses wrote the book of Job sometime after Job’s death.
In what ways is the book of Job an encouragement to Jehovah’s servants in modern times?
The book of Job strengthens the faith of God’s servants in modern times.
The narrative opens our eyes to events of far - reaching importance that occurred in heaven and underscores the paramount issue of God’s universal sovereignty.
The account of Job also deepens our understanding of what is involved in keeping integrity and helps us to grasp why Jehovah sometimes allows his servants to suffer.
Furthermore, the book of Job identifies Satan the Devil as Jehovah’s chief Adversary and mankind’s enemy.
The book also shows that imperfect humans like Job can remain loyal to Jehovah despite intense testing.
Let us examine some of the events described in the book of Job.
What do we know about Job, and why did Satan target him?
Job was a wealthy and influential man, a patriarch of good moral character.
He was evidently a highly regarded counselor who befriended the needy.
Most important, Job feared God.
Job is described as a man who “proved to be blameless and upright, and fearing God and turning aside from bad. ”
It was Job’s godly devotion ​ — not his wealth and influence — ​ that made him a target for the attacks of Satan the Devil. ​ — Job 1: 1; 29: 7 - 16; 31: 1.
What is integrity?
Satan was also present, and he leveled charges against Job. (Read Job 1: 6 - 11.)
Although Satan mentioned Job’s possessions, he focused his attention on challenging Job’s integrity.
The term “integrity ” carries the thought of being upright, blameless, righteous, and faultless.
As used in the Bible, human integrity denotes a completeness of heart devotion to the person of Jehovah.
What did Satan claim about Job?
Satan claimed that Job’s worship of God was based on selfishness, not integrity.
Satan alleged that Job would be loyal to Jehovah only as long as God continued to reward and protect him.
To provide an answer to Satan’s charge, Jehovah allowed Satan to attack that faithful man.
As a result, within the course of one day, Job learned that his livestock had been stolen or destroyed, his attendants had been killed, and his ten children had lost their lives.
Did Job cave in to Satan’s attack?
The inspired record describes Job’s reaction to his misfortune: “Jehovah himself has given, and Jehovah himself has taken away.
Let the name of Jehovah continue to be blessed. ” ​ — Job 1: 21.
(a) What happened during another gathering in heaven?
(b) Whom did Satan have in mind when he challenged Job’s integrity to Jehovah?
Later, there was another gathering in heaven.
Again Satan leveled charges against Job, saying: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul.
For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face. ”
Notice that Satan expanded his accusations.
By saying, “Everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul, ” the Devil challenged the integrity not only of Job but of any“ man ” who worships Jehovah.
Thereafter, God permitted Satan to strike Job with a painful disease.
But that was not the full extent of Job’s trials.
Taking Stock of Job’s Position
In what ways did Job’s wife and his visitors put pressure on Job?
Initially, Job’s wife suffered the same blows that her husband suffered.
The loss of her children and the family wealth must have devastated her.
It must have hurt her to see her husband suffering a painful disease.
She cried out to Job: “Are you yet holding fast your integrity?
Curse God and die! ”
Then, three men arrived ​ — Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar — ​ ostensibly to offer Job comfort.
Instead, they used deceptive reasoning and proved to be “troublesome comforters. ”
For example, Bildad suggested that Job’s children had engaged in wrongdoing and deserved their fate.
Eliphaz insinuated that Job’s suffering was punishment for past sins.
He even questioned whether those who keep integrity are of any value to God!
Under such heavy pressure, Job kept his integrity.
True, he could be faulted when he turned to “declaring his own soul righteous rather than God. ”
Still, he remained faithful through it all.
What good example did Elihu provide for counselors today?
Elihu first listened to the arguments presented by Job and his three companions.
Although younger than the other four men, Elihu showed greater wisdom.
He addressed Job considerately, using Job’s personal name. Elihu commended Job for his upright course.
But he also said that Job had focused too much on trying to prove his own faultlessness.
Then Elihu assured Job that serving God faithfully is always worthwhile.
(Read Job 36: 1, 11.)
What a fine example for those who need to offer counsel today!
Elihu showed patience, listened carefully, commended where possible, and offered upbuilding counsel. ​ — Job 32: 6; 33: 32.
How did Jehovah help Job?
Finally, Job had a truly awe - inspiring visitor!
The record says: “Jehovah proceeded to answer Job out of the windstorm. ”
Using a series of questions, Jehovah kindly but firmly helped Job to correct his thinking.
Job willingly accepted the reproof, admitting: “I have become of little account...
I do repent in dust and ashes. ”
After Jehovah had spoken to Job, He expressed His anger against the three companions because they had not spoken “what is truthful. ”
Job was to pray for them. Then “Jehovah himself turned back the captive condition of Job when he prayed in behalf of his companions, and Jehovah began to give in addition all that had been Job’s, in double amount. ” ​ — Job 38: 1; 40: 4; 42: 6 - 10.
How Deeply Do We Love Jehovah?
Why did Jehovah not ignore or destroy Satan?
Jehovah is the Creator of the universe, Sovereign of all creation.
Why did he not ignore the Devil’s challenge?
God knew that neither ignoring Satan nor destroying him would resolve the issue that had been raised.
The Devil had claimed that Job, an outstanding servant of Jehovah, would not remain loyal if he lost his favored economic situation.
Job’s loyalty withstood the test.
Then Satan claimed that any human would turn away from God if he suffered physically.
Job suffered, but his integrity was not broken.
Hence, Satan was proved to be a liar in the case of that faithful though imperfect man.
What of other worshippers of God?
How did Jesus give a complete answer to Satan’s challenge?
In effect, each servant of God who keeps his integrity despite whatever Satan brings against him demonstrates that in his own personal case, the accusations of that remorseless enemy are false.
Jesus came to earth and gave a complete answer to Satan’s challenge. Jesus was a perfect man, like our first father, Adam.
Jesus ’ faithfulness to the death conclusively demonstrated that Satan is a liar and that his accusations are false. ​ — Rev. 12: 10.
Each servant of Jehovah has what opportunity and responsibility?
Nevertheless, Satan keeps testing Jehovah’s worshippers.
Each of us has the opportunity and the responsibility to demonstrate by our personal integrity that we serve Jehovah because we love him ​ — not for selfish reasons.
How do we view that responsibility? We see it as a privilege to be loyal to Jehovah.
It also comforts us to know that Jehovah gives us the strength to endure and, as in the case of Job, that He sets limits to the trials we face. ​ — 1 Cor.
10: 13. Satan ​ — A Defiant Adversary and Apostate
What details does the book of Job reveal about Satan?
The Hebrew Scriptures provide details about Satan’s shameful role in challenging Jehovah and leading mankind astray.
In the Christian Greek Scriptures, we find more information about Satan’s opposition to Jehovah, and in the book of Revelation, we learn of the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty and Satan’s final destruction.
The book of Job adds to our knowledge of Satan’s rebellious course.
When Satan was present at the gatherings in heaven, he did not attend with the intention of praising Jehovah.
The Devil had a malicious attitude and a sinister objective.
After he accused Job and received permission to test him, “Satan went out away from the person of Jehovah. ” ​ — Job 1: 12; 2: 7.
Satan showed what attitude toward Job?
Hence, the book of Job identifies Satan as mankind’s merciless enemy.
Between the gathering in heaven mentioned at Job 1: 6 and the one described at Job 2: 1, an unspecified period of time passed, during which Job was cruelly put to the test.
Job’s faithfulness enabled Jehovah to say to Satan: “Even yet [Job] is holding fast his integrity, although you incite me against him to swallow him up without cause. ”
But Satan did not admit that his claims had been proved wrong.
On the contrary, he demanded that Job be put to another severe test.
Thus, the Devil tested Job both when he was prosperous and when he was destitute.
Clearly, Satan has no compassion for the needy or for victims of calamity. He hates people of integrity.
Nevertheless, Job’s faithfulness showed that Satan is a liar.
What do modern - day apostates have in common with Satan?
Satan was the first creature to turn apostate.
Modern - day apostates display characteristics similar to those of the Devil.
Their mind may be poisoned by a critical attitude toward individuals in the congregations, Christian elders, or the Governing Body.
Some apostates oppose the use of the divine name, Jehovah.
They are not interested in learning about Jehovah or in serving him. Like their father, Satan, apostates target people of integrity.
No wonder servants of Jehovah avoid all contact with them! ​ — 2 John 10, 11.
Job Held High the Name of Jehovah
Job displayed what attitude toward Jehovah?
Job used and praised the name of Jehovah.
Even when crushed by the news of the death of his children, Job did not ascribe anything improper to God.
Although Job wrongly attributed his loss to God, he nevertheless upheld the name of Jehovah.
In one of his later proverbial utterances, Job declared: “Look! The fear of Jehovah ​ — that is wisdom, and to turn away from bad is understanding. ” ​ — Job 28: 28.
What helped Job to maintain his integrity?
What helped Job to maintain his integrity?
Clearly, before the calamities struck, he had already cultivated a close relationship with Jehovah.
Although we have no evidence that he knew that Satan had challenged Jehovah, Job was determined to stay loyal.
He said: “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself! ”
How did Job develop this close relationship?
No doubt, he cherished what he had heard about God’s dealings with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were his distant relatives.
And by observing creation, Job could discern many of Jehovah’s qualities. ​ — Read Job 12: 7 - 9, 13, 16.
(a) How did Job show his devotion to Jehovah?
(b) In what ways do we imitate Job’s fine example?
What Job learned aroused in him the desire to please Jehovah.
In case his family members might have done something displeasing to God or “have cursed God in their heart, ” he regularly offered sacrifices.
Even when being severely tested, Job still said positive things about Jehovah.
What a fine example!
We too must regularly take in accurate knowledge of Jehovah and his purposes.
We hold to a healthy routine in such spiritual activities as study, meeting attendance, prayer, and the preaching of the good news.
Moreover, we do everything in our power to make known the name of Jehovah.
And just as Job’s integrity pleased Jehovah, so the integrity of God’s servants today makes Jehovah’s heart rejoice.
This subject will be considered in the following article.
• Why did Job attract the attention of Satan the Devil?
• What tests did Job endure, and how did he react?
• What will help us to maintain integrity as Job did?
• What do we learn about Satan from the book of Job?
[Picture on page 4]
The narrative of Job alerts us to the paramount issue of God’s universal sovereignty
[Picture on page 6]
Under what circumstances might your integrity be put to the test?
Your Integrity Makes Jehovah’s Heart Rejoice
“Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, that I may make a reply to him that is taunting me. ” ​ — PROV.
27: 11.
1, 2. (a) The book of Job describes what challenge made by Satan?
(b) What indicates that Satan continued taunting Jehovah after the days of Job?
JEHOVAH permitted Satan to test the integrity of God’s loyal servant Job.
As a result, Job lost his livestock, his children, and his health.
But when Satan challenged Job’s integrity, he had more in mind than just the man Job.
“Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul, ” claimed Satan.
This challenge raised an issue that went far beyond Job as an individual and that has continued long after his death. ​ — Job 2: 4.
About 600 years after Job’s trials, Solomon was inspired to write: “Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, that I may make a reply to him that is taunting me. ”
Clearly, at that time Satan was still challenging Jehovah.
Moreover, in a vision given to the apostle John, Satan was seen accusing God’s servants following his eviction from heaven some time after the establishment of God’s Kingdom in 1914.
Yes, even today, so deep into the last days of this wicked system, Satan is still challenging the integrity of God’s servants! ​ — Rev. 12: 10.
What valuable lessons can we learn from the book of Job?
Consider, then, three of the important lessons that we learn from the book of Job. First, the trials of Job expose the real enemy of mankind and the source of opposition against God’s people. That enemy is Satan the Devil.
Second, no matter what trials we may encounter, having a close relationship with God will enable us to maintain our integrity.
Third, when trials occur and we are tested in some way, God supports us just as he did Job. Today, Jehovah does this by means of his Word, his organization, and his holy spirit.
Keep the Real Enemy in Mind
Who is to blame for present world conditions?
Many do not believe that Satan exists.
Thus, although they might be alarmed about world conditions, they do not discern the real cause ​ — Satan the Devil.
True, much of the responsibility for mankind’s woes rests with humans themselves.
Our first parents, Adam and Eve, chose independence from their Creator.
And since then, successive generations have acted very unwisely.
Still, it was the Devil who deceived Eve into rebelling against God.
He is the one who has developed among imperfect, dying mankind a world system under his control.
Because Satan is “the god of this system of things, ” human society displays the same basic characteristics that he does ​ — pride, contentiousness, jealousy, greed, deception, and rebelliousness.
Such characteristics have led to political and religious conflicts, hatred, corruption, and disorder, which contribute much to mankind’s misery.
What do we want to do with the precious knowledge we possess?
What precious knowledge we as Jehovah’s servants have!
Yes, we understand who is to blame for deteriorating world conditions.
Do we not, then, feel impelled to share in the field ministry so as to inform people of the identity of the chief troublemaker?
And are we not happy to stand up for the true God, Jehovah, and to explain to others how he will put an end to Satan and to mankind’s woes?
6, 7. (a) Who is responsible for the persecution of true worshippers?
(b) How can we imitate the example of Elihu of old?
Satan is responsible not only for many of the world’s sorrows but also for the opposition that God’s people experience.
He is determined to put us to the test.
Jesus Christ told the apostle Peter: “Simon, Simon, look!
Satan has demanded to have you men to sift you as wheat. ”
Similarly, each of us who follows in Jesus ’ footsteps will experience trials in some way or other.
Peter compared the Devil to “a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone. ”
And Paul said: “All those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted. ” ​ — 1 Pet.
5: 8; 2 Tim.
3: 12.
We join our brother in the struggle against our common enemy, Satan. Our goal is to help our fellow servant to maintain his integrity, come what may, and thus make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.
Why did Satan not succeed in getting Job to stop honoring Jehovah?
The first asset that Satan caused Job to lose was his livestock.
Those animals were valuable, likely his livelihood. But Job also used them in worship.
After Job had sanctified his children, “he got up early in the morning and offered up burnt sacrifices according to the number of all of them; for, said Job, ‘ maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart. ’
That is the way Job would do always. ”
Thus, Job sacrificed animals to Jehovah on a regular basis. Once the trials began, that was no longer possible.
Job had no “valuable things ” with which to honor Jehovah.
But he could ​ — and did — ​ honor Jehovah with his lips!
What is our most precious possession?
Whether we are rich or poor, young or elderly, in good health or bad, we can cultivate a close relationship with Jehovah.
Regardless of the trials we face, having a close bond with God will enable us to maintain our personal integrity and make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.
Even some individuals who had limited knowledge of the truth took a courageous stand and kept their integrity.
10, 11. (a) How did one of our sisters react to tests of integrity?
(b) What powerful answer did this sister give to Satan?
Consider the example of Sister Valentina Garnovskaya, one of many Witnesses in Russia who like faithful Job kept their integrity despite severe trials. In 1945, when she was about 20 years old, a brother witnessed to her. He returned two more times to talk about the Bible, but then she never saw him again. Even so, Valentina began to preach to her neighbors.
As a result, she was arrested and sentenced to eight years in a camp. In 1953 she was released and right away resumed her preaching work.
Again she was arrested and imprisoned ​ — this time for ten years.
After spending several years in one camp, she was moved to another. In that camp, there were some sisters who had a copy of the Bible. One day a sister showed the Bible to Valentina. What a thrilling moment!
Imagine, the only other Bible that Valentina had ever seen was the one in the hands of the brother who witnessed to her in 1945!
In 1967, Valentina was set free and was finally able to symbolize her dedication to Jehovah by water baptism.
She zealously used her freedom to participate in the ministry until 1969.
That year, however, she was again arrested, and this time she was sentenced to serve three years in prison.
Before she died in 2001, she had helped 44 people to learn the truth. She had spent 21 years in prisons and camps. She had been willing to give up everything, including her freedom, in order to maintain her integrity.
At the end of her life, Valentina said: “I never had my own place to live. All my possessions were in a single suitcase, but I was happy and content in serving Jehovah. ”
What a powerful answer Valentina gave to Satan, who claimed that humans will not remain loyal to God in the face of trials!
We can be sure that she made Jehovah’s heart rejoice and that he eagerly looks forward to the time when he will bring Valentina and all others who died faithful back to life by means of the resurrection. ​ — Job 14: 15.
What role does love play in our relationship with Jehovah?
Our friendship with Jehovah is based on our love for him.
We admire God’s qualities and do whatever we can to live in harmony with his purposes.
Contrary to what the Devil claims, we give our love to Jehovah voluntarily and unconditionally.
This heartfelt love strengthens us to maintain integrity under test.
For his part, Jehovah “will guard the very way of his loyal ones. ” ​ — Prov.
2: 8; Ps.
97: 10.
How does Jehovah view what we do for him?
Love moves us to honor the name of Jehovah, no matter how limited we may feel.
He sees our good motives and does not judge us if we cannot do all we would like to do. What counts is not only what we do but also why we do it.
Even though Job was grief - stricken and had endured much, he spoke to his accusers about his love for Jehovah’s ways.
(Read Job 10: 12; 28: 28.)
In the final chapter of the book of Job, God expressed his anger toward Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar because they had not spoken the truth.
At the same time, Jehovah indicated his approval of Job by referring to him four times as “my servant ” and by instructing him to intercede in behalf of the wrongdoers.
May we too act in such a way that Jehovah views us with favor.
Jehovah Supports His Faithful Servants
How did Jehovah help Job to correct his thinking?
Job maintained his integrity even though he was imperfect.
Sometimes, under extreme pressure, he had the wrong perspective.
For instance, he said to Jehovah: “I cry to you for help, but you do not answer me...
With the full might of your hand you harbor animosity toward me. ”
Moreover, Job attached undue importance to justifying himself when he said: “I am not in the wrong ” and“ there is no violence upon my palms, and my prayer is pure. ”
Nevertheless, Jehovah kindly helped Job by posing a series of questions that directed attention away from Job.
They also enabled Job to see more clearly God’s supremacy and the insignificance of man.
Job accepted the direction and corrected himself. ​ — Read Job 40: 8; 42: 2, 6.
15, 16.
In what ways does Jehovah provide help to his servants today?
Jehovah also offers kind, firm guidance to his servants today.
Moreover, we enjoy important benefits.
For instance, Jesus Christ provided the ransom sacrifice and thus laid the groundwork for forgiveness of sins.
On the basis of that sacrifice, we can have a close relationship with God despite our imperfection.
When facing trials, we also pray for the support and strengthening aid of God’s holy spirit.
Additionally, we have the complete Bible, and if we read it and meditate on its contents, we prepare ourselves for tests of faith.
Study helps us to understand the issues of universal sovereignty and personal integrity.
Further, we benefit greatly from being part of the earth - wide brotherhood that Jehovah supplies with spiritual food by means of “the faithful and discreet slave. ”
In each of the approximately 100,000 congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses, meetings are conducted that instruct us and strengthen us to face possible tests of faith.
This can be illustrated by the experience of Sheila, a teenage Witness living in Germany.
Illustrate the wisdom of sticking closely to the instruction of Jehovah’s organization today.
One day at school, Sheila’s class was temporarily left without supervision.
Her classmates decided to experiment with a Ouija board.
Sheila immediately left the classroom, and what she later heard made her glad she had done so.
While using the Ouija board, some of the students felt the presence of demons and fled in panic.
What, though, had helped Sheila to decide to leave the room so quickly?
“Shortly before this incident, we had discussed at a meeting at the Kingdom Hall the dangers of Ouija boards.
So I knew what to do, ” explains Sheila.
“I wanted to please Jehovah, just as the Bible says at Proverbs 27: 11. ”
How good that Sheila was at the meeting and listened attentively to the program!
What are you personally resolved to do?
Let each of us be resolved to stick closely to the instruction we receive from God’s organization.
By regular meeting attendance, Bible reading, study of Bible - based publications, prayer, and fellowship with mature Christians, we get the guidance and support we need.
Jehovah wants us to be victorious, and he has confidence that we will continue to be loyal.
What a privilege we have to hold high the name of Jehovah, to maintain integrity, and to make the heart of Jehovah rejoice!

Appreciating the Greater Moses
“Jehovah God will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me. You must listen to him. ” ​ — ACTS 3: 22.
How has Jesus Christ influenced history?
TWO thousand years ago, the birth of a certain male child caused a multitude of angels in heaven to praise God in the hearing of some shepherds.
Thirty years later, that child, now an adult, began a ministry that lasted just three and a half years and yet changed history.
The noted 19th - century historian Philip Schaff was moved to state of this young man: “Without writing a single line, he set more pens in motion, and furnished themes for more sermons, orations, discussions, learned volumes, works of art, and songs of praise, than the whole army of great men of ancient and modern times. ”
That remarkable young man was, of course, Jesus Christ.
What did the apostle John say about Jesus and His ministry?
The apostle John wrote an account of Jesus ’ ministry and said in conclusion: “There are, in fact, many other things also which Jesus did, which, if ever they were written in full detail, I suppose, the world itself could not contain the scrolls written. ”
John knew that he could record only a fraction of all that Jesus said and did during those eventful three and a half years.
Still, the historic events reported by John in his Gospel are of immense value.
How can we deepen our insight into Jesus ’ role in God’s purpose?
Besides the four important Gospel accounts, other Bible passages provide faith - strengthening details about Jesus ’ life.
For instance, the Bible accounts of certain faithful men who lived before Jesus contain information that deepens our insight into Jesus ’ role in God’s purpose.
Let us consider some of these.
Men of God Who Prefigured the Christ
4, 5.
Who foreshadowed Jesus, and in what ways?
John and the other three Gospel writers point to Moses, David, and Solomon as men who foreshadowed Jesus as God’s Anointed One and designated King.
In what way did those ancient servants of God provide foregleams of Jesus, and what can we learn from these accounts?
In brief, the Bible tells us that Moses was a prophet, a mediator, and a deliverer.
So is Jesus.
David was a shepherd and a king who conquered Israel’s enemies.
Jesus too is a shepherd and a conquering king.
While still faithful, Solomon was a wise ruler, and under his kingship Israel enjoyed peace.
Jesus too is supremely wise and is called “Prince of Peace. ”
Clearly, Christ Jesus ’ role resembles that of those earlier men but Jesus ’ place in God’s purpose is superlative.
First, let us compare Jesus with Moses and see how such a comparison helps us to appreciate more fully Jesus ’ role in God’s purpose.
Moses ​ — A Forerunner of Jesus
How did the apostle Peter explain the necessity of listening to Jesus?
Shortly after Pentecost 33 C.E., the apostle Peter quoted a prophecy by Moses that was fulfilled in Jesus Christ.
Peter was standing before a crowd of worshippers in the temple. The people were “surprised out of their wits ” when Peter and John healed a beggar who was lame from birth, and they all ran to investigate.
Peter explained that this astonishing act was a result of Jehovah’s holy spirit operating through Jesus Christ.
Then, quoting from the Hebrew Scriptures, he said: “In fact, Moses said, ‘ Jehovah God will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me. You must listen to him according to all the things he speaks to you. ’ ” ​ — Acts 3: 11, 22, 23; read Deuteronomy 18: 15, 18, 19.
Why could Peter’s audience understand his statements about a prophet greater than Moses?
With keen anticipation, they looked forward to the coming of a prophet greater than Moses.
That prophet would prove to be not just a messiah, an anointed one of God like Moses, but the Messiah, “the Christ of God, the Chosen One ” of Jehovah. ​ — Luke 23: 35; Heb.
11: 26.
Similarities Between Jesus and Moses
What are some similarities between the life of Moses and that of Jesus?
In some respects, the earthly life of Jesus resembled the life of Moses.
For instance, as babes, both Moses and Jesus escaped death at the hands of a tyrannical ruler.
In addition, both were ‘ called out of Egypt. ’
The prophet Hosea stated: “When Israel was a boy, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. ” Hosea’s words pointed back to the time when the nation of Israel, under its divinely appointed leader, Moses, was led out of Egypt.
However, Hosea’s words referred not only to a past event but also to a future one.
His words were a prophecy that was fulfilled when Joseph and Mary returned from Egypt with Jesus after the death of King Herod. ​ — Matt.
2: 15, 19 - 23.
(a) What miracles did Moses and Jesus perform?
(b) Give other similarities between Jesus and Moses.
(See the box “Additional Ways in Which Jesus Was Like Moses, ” on page 26.)
Both Moses and Jesus performed miracles, thus demonstrating that they had Jehovah’s backing.
Indeed, Moses was the first human on record to perform miracles.
For example, Moses performed miracles involving water when at his command the waters of the Nile and its reedy pools became blood, the Red Sea was parted, and water came gushing out of rock in the desert.
Jesus too performed miracles involving water.
His very first miracle was that of turning water into wine at a wedding feast.
Later, he calmed the turbulent Sea of Galilee.
And on one occasion, he even walked on water!
Some other similarities between Moses and the Greater Moses, Jesus, can be seen in the box on page 26.
Appreciate Christ as a Prophet
What is a true prophet, and why was Moses one?
Most people think of a prophet as someone who foretells the future, but that is only part of a prophet’s responsibility.
A true prophet is an inspired spokesman for Jehovah, one who proclaims “the magnificent things of God. ”
Among other things, his prophesying could include announcing future events, revealing aspects of Jehovah’s purpose, or proclaiming God’s judgments.
Moses was such a prophet.
He foretold each of the Ten Plagues that befell Egypt.
He introduced the Law covenant at Sinai. And he instructed the nation in God’s will.
Yet, a prophet greater than Moses was to come eventually.
How did Jesus fulfill the role of a prophet greater than Moses?
Later, in the first century, Zechariah acted as a prophet in revealing God’s purpose regarding his son, John.
That son became John the Baptizer, who announced the coming of the long - awaited prophet greater than Moses ​ — Jesus Christ.
As a prophet, Jesus foretold many things.
For example, he spoke about his own death, foretelling how he would die, where he would die, and at whose hands he would die.
To the surprise of his listeners, Jesus also foretold the destruction of Jerusalem with its temple.
His prophecies reach right down to our own time. ​ — Matt.
24: 3 - 41. (a) How did Jesus lay the foundation for a global preaching campaign?
(b) Why do we follow Jesus ’ example today?
In addition to being a prophet, Jesus was a preacher and a teacher.
He preached the good news of God’s Kingdom, and no one spoke with greater boldness than he did.
As a teacher, he had no equal.
“Never has another man spoken like this, ” said some who heard him.
Jesus was zealous in his efforts to spread the good news, and he inspired his followers with that same zeal for the Kingdom.
Thus, he laid the foundation for a global preaching and teaching campaign that is still continuing.
Last year, some seven million of Christ’s followers spent about 1,500,000,000 hours in preaching the good news of the Kingdom and teaching interested ones Bible truths.
Do you have a meaningful share in that work?
What will help us to “stay awake ”?
There is no question that Jehovah fulfilled the prophecy to raise up a prophet like Moses.
How does that knowledge affect you?
Does it give you more confidence in the fulfillment of inspired prophecies that have to do with our immediate future?
Value Christ as Mediator
How was Moses a mediator between the Israelites and God?
Like Moses, Jesus was a mediator.
A mediator acts as a bridge between two parties.
Moses mediated the Law covenant between Jehovah and the Israelites.
If the sons of Jacob obeyed the laws of God, they would remain God’s special property, his congregation.
That covenant stayed in force from 1513 B.C.E. until the first century C.E.
How is Jesus a superior mediator?
In 33 C.E., Jehovah initiated a better covenant with a new Israel, “the Israel of God, ” which became a worldwide congregation made up of anointed Christians.
While the covenant mediated by Moses included laws written by God on stone, the covenant mediated by Jesus is superior.
Its laws are inscribed by God on human hearts. (Read 1 Timothy 2: 5; Hebrews 8: 10.)
Thus, “the Israel of God ” is now God’s special property, ‘ a nation producing the fruits ’ of the Messianic Kingdom.
Members of that spiritual nation are the participants in that new covenant. Still, they are not the only ones to benefit from it.
Untold multitudes, even many who at present are asleep in death, will receive everlasting blessings because of that superlative covenant.
Esteem Christ as Deliverer
(a) In what ways did Jehovah use Moses to deliver Israel?
(b) According to Exodus 14: 13, who is the Source of salvation?
On their last night before the Exodus, some of the offspring of Israel were in grave danger.
Soon, God’s angel would pass through the land of Egypt, killing all the firstborn.
Jehovah told Moses that the firstborn of Israel would be saved if the Israelites took the blood of the Passover lamb and sprinkled it on the lintels and doorposts of their doorways.
So it proved to be.
Later, the whole nation was in serious danger.
They were trapped between the Red Sea and the pursuing Egyptian war chariots.
Jehovah again provided deliverance through Moses, who miraculously parted the waters of that sea. ​ — Ex.
14: 13, 21.
17, 18.
In what ways is Jesus a greater deliverer than Moses?
Great as those acts of deliverance were, the deliverance Jehovah performed through Jesus is much greater.
Jesus is the means by which obedient ones are delivered from slavery to sin.
And that deliverance is “an everlasting deliverance. ”
The name Jesus means “Jehovah Is Salvation. ” Jesus, as our Deliverer, or Savior, not only rescues us from our past sins but also opens the way for us to enjoy a better future.
By delivering them from slavery to sin, Jesus saves his followers from the wrath of God and brings them into a loving relationship with Jehovah. ​ — Matt. 1: 21.
The deliverance from sin that Jesus provides will in due time include freedom from its grim effects ​ — sickness and even death.
To visualize what that will mean, consider what happened when Jesus went to the home of a certain man named Jairus, whose 12 - year - old daughter had died.
Jesus reassured Jairus: “Have no fear, only put forth faith, and she will be saved. ”
True to his words, the girl rose from the dead!
Then you have an idea of the surpassing joy that will be ours when “all those in the memorial tombs will hear [Jesus ’] voice and come out ” in the resurrection.
Truly, Jesus is a Savior, our Deliverer! ​ — Read Acts 5: 31; Titus 1: 4; Rev.
7: 10.
19, 20. (a) How does meditating on Jesus ’ role as the Greater Moses affect us?
(b) What will the next article consider?
Further, meditating on Jesus ’ role as the Greater Moses deepens our confidence that he will deliver his followers when he comes to execute judgment upon the wicked. ​ — Matt. 25: 31 - 34, 41, 46; Rev.
7: 9, 14.
Yes, Jesus is the Greater Moses.
He did many marvelous things that Moses could never have done.
Jesus ’ words as a prophet and his actions as a mediator affect the entire human family.
As a Deliverer, Jesus brings not temporary but eternal salvation for redeemable mankind.
Yet, there is more to learn about Jesus from the faithful men of old.
The next article will discuss how he was the Greater David and the Greater Solomon.
How is Jesus greater than Moses as
• a prophet?
• a mediator?
• a deliverer?

Appreciating Jesus ​ — The Greater David and the Greater Solomon
“Look! something more than Solomon is here. ” ​ — MATT. 12: 42.
1, 2.
From a human point of view, why was it surprising that Samuel was instructed to anoint David as king?
HE DID not look like a king.
Rather, to the prophet Samuel, he appeared to be nothing more than a young shepherd boy.
Moreover, his hometown, Bethlehem, was not of great prominence.
It was described as “too little to get to be among the thousands of Judah. ”
Nevertheless, this apparently insignificant young man from a small town was about to be anointed by the prophet Samuel as the future king of Israel.
Young David was not the first son that his father, Jesse, presented to Samuel to be anointed; neither was he the second or third.
David, the last of eight boys born to Jesse, was not even present when Samuel came to Jesse’s household to anoint one of that faithful man’s sons as the next king of the land.
But David was Jehovah’s choice, and that was what counted. ​ — 1 Sam.
16: 1 - 10.
(a) What does Jehovah view as most important when he examines an individual?
(b) At the time of David’s anointing, what became operative upon him?
God could discern David’s heart condition, and it was pleasing to him. With God, it is not the mere outward appearance that matters; it is what a person really is on the inside.
(Read 1 Samuel 16: 7.)
So when Samuel learned that Jehovah had not chosen any of the seven older sons of Jesse, he asked that the youngest be brought in from the pastures.
The account says: “Accordingly [Jesse] sent and had [David] come. Now he was ruddy, a young man with beautiful eyes and handsome in appearance.
Accordingly Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers.
And the spirit of Jehovah began to be operative upon David from that day forward. ” ​ — 1 Sam.
16: 12, 13.
David Prefigured Christ
4, 5. (a) Describe some parallels between David and Jesus. (b) Why can Jesus be called the Greater David?
Jesus, like David, was born in Bethlehem, some 1,100 years after David’s time.
In the eyes of many, Jesus too did not look like a king.
That is, he was not the kind of king that many in Israel hoped for.
Yet, like David, he was Jehovah’s choice.
He, like David, was beloved by Jehovah.
* In Jesus ’ case too, ‘ the spirit of Jehovah became operative upon him. ’
The parallels between the two continue.
For instance, David was betrayed by his counselor Ahithophel, and Jesus was betrayed by his apostle Judas Iscariot.
Both David and Jesus had a consuming zeal for Jehovah’s place of worship.
Jesus was also David’s heir.
Before Jesus ’ birth, an angel told his mother: “Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father. ”
However, because all Messianic promises are to be fulfilled in Jesus, he is far more than David.
He is the Greater David, the long - hoped - for Messianic King. ​ — John 7: 42.
Follow the Shepherd - King
In what ways was David a good shepherd?
Jesus is also a shepherd.
What are the characteristics of a good shepherd?
He is someone who faithfully and courageously tends, feeds, and guards his flock.
As a youth, David was a shepherd, and he took very good care of his father’s sheep.
He was courageous when the flock was threatened and risked his life to protect the sheep from a lion and a bear. ​ — 1 Sam.
17: 34, 35.
(a) What prepared David for his duties as king?
(b) How did Jesus prove to be the Fine Shepherd?
The years David spent in fields and on hills tending sheep prepared him for the demanding duties and responsibilities of shepherding the nation of Israel.
* Jesus too has proved to be a model shepherd.
He derives strength and guidance from Jehovah as he shepherds his “little flock ” and the“ other sheep. ”
Thus Jesus proves to be the Fine Shepherd.
He knows his flock so well that he calls each sheep by name.
He loves his sheep so much that while on earth he willingly gave of himself for their well - being.
As the Fine Shepherd, Jesus accomplishes something that David could never do.
His ransom sacrifice opened the way for mankind to be rescued from death.
Nothing will stop him from shepherding his “little flock ” to immortal life in heaven and leading his“ other sheep ” to everlasting life in a righteous new world free from wolflike predators. ​ — Read John 10: 27 - 29.
Follow the Conquering King
How did David prove to be a conquering king?
As king, David was a resolute warrior who protected the land of God’s people, and “Jehovah kept saving David wherever he went. ”
Under David’s leadership, the nation’s boundaries were extended from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates.
In Jehovah’s strength, he became a most powerful ruler.
The Bible states: “David’s fame began to go out into all the lands, and Jehovah himself put the dread of him upon all the nations. ” ​ — 1 Chron.
14: 17.
Explain how Jesus as King - Designate was a conqueror.
Like King David, the man Jesus was fearless.
As King - Designate, he showed his authority over the demons, rescuing victims from their clutches.
Even the archenemy, Satan the Devil, has no hold on him.
With Jehovah’s support, Jesus conquered the world, which lies in Satan’s power. ​ — John 14: 30; 16: 33; 1 John 5: 19.
10, 11.
What is Jesus ’ role as Warrior - King in the heavens?
Some 60 years after Jesus ’ death and resurrection to heaven, the apostle John received a prophetic vision of Jesus in His role as Warrior - King in the heavens. John writes: “Look!
a white horse; and the one seated upon it had a bow; and a crown was given him, and he went forth conquering and to complete his conquest. ”
The rider on the white horse is Jesus.
“A crown was given him ” in 1914 when he was enthroned as King in the heavenly Kingdom.
After that, “he went forth conquering. ”
Yes, like David, Jesus is a conquering king. Shortly after he was installed as King of God’s Kingdom, he conquered Satan in battle and hurled him and his demons down to the earth.
His victorious ride will continue until he will “complete his conquest, ” completely destroying Satan’s wicked system. ​ — Read Revelation 19: 11, 19 - 21.
Like David, though, Jesus is a compassionate king, and he will protect the “great crowd ” through Armageddon.
Furthermore, under the rule of Jesus and his joint heirs, the resurrected 144,000, there will be “a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. ”
Those who are resurrected on earth will have the prospect of living forever.
What a wonderful future awaits them!
May we all be determined to continue to “do what is good, ” so that we will be alive when the earth is filled with righteous, happy subjects of the Greater David. ​ — Ps.
37: 27 - 29.
Solomon’s Prayer for Wisdom Is Answered
For what did Solomon pray?
David’s son Solomon also prefigured Jesus.
* When Solomon became king, Jehovah appeared to him in a dream and said that He would give him anything he asked for.
Solomon could have asked for more wealth, power, or a longer life. Instead, he unselfishly asked Jehovah: “Give me now wisdom and knowledge that I may go out before this people and that I may come in, for who could judge this great people of yours? ”
Jehovah answered Solomon’s prayer. ​ — Read 2 Chronicles 1: 11, 12.
How was Solomon’s wisdom unmatched, and what was its Source?
As long as Solomon was faithful to Jehovah, his words of wisdom were unmatched among his contemporaries.
Solomon spoke “three thousand proverbs. ”
Many of these were written down and are still treasured by those who seek wisdom.
The queen of Sheba traveled some 1,500 miles [2,400 km] to test Solomon’s wisdom with “perplexing questions. ”
She was impressed by what Solomon said and by the prosperity of his kingdom.
The Bible identifies the Source of Solomon’s wisdom by stating: “All the people of the earth were seeking the face of Solomon to hear his wisdom that God had put in his heart. ” ​ — 1 Ki.
10: 24.
Follow the Wise King
In what ways was Jesus “something more than Solomon ”?
Only one human clearly surpassed Solomon in wisdom.
That was Jesus Christ, who described himself as “something more than Solomon. ”
Jesus spoke “sayings of everlasting life. ”
For example, the Sermon on the Mount expands on the principles of some of Solomon’s proverbs.
Solomon described a number of things that bring happiness to a worshipper of Jehovah.
Jesus emphasized that true happiness stems from things that are related to the worship of Jehovah and the fulfillment of God’s promises.
He said: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them. ”
Those who apply the principles found in Jesus ’ teachings are drawn closer to Jehovah, “the source of life. ”
Christ embodies “the wisdom of God. ”
As the Messianic King, Jesus Christ has “the spirit of wisdom. ” ​ — Isa.
11: 2.
How can we benefit from godly wisdom?
How can we, as followers of the Greater Solomon, benefit from godly wisdom?
Since Jehovah’s wisdom is revealed in his Word, we must put forth the effort to find it by carefully studying the Bible, particularly the recorded words of Jesus, and by meditating on what we read.
Further, we need to persevere in asking God for wisdom.
God’s Word assures us that our sincere prayers for help will be answered.
With the help of the holy spirit, we will find gems of wisdom in God’s Word that can help us to deal with challenges and make wise decisions.
Solomon was also called “the congregator ” who“ taught the people knowledge continually. ”
Jesus, as Head of the Christian congregation, is also a congregator of his people.
Therefore, we do well to attend congregation meetings, where we are ‘ taught continually. ’
What similarity is there between Solomon and Jesus?
Solomon was a very active king.
He organized a nationwide construction program, overseeing the building of palaces, roads, waterworks, storage cities, chariot cities, and cities for the horsemen.
The entire kingdom benefited from his building works.
Jesus too is a builder.
He built his congregation on the “rock - mass. ”
He will also oversee the building work to be carried out in the new world. ​ — Isa.
65: 21, 22.
Follow the King of Peace
(a) What was an outstanding characteristic of Solomon’s rule?
(b) What could Solomon not accomplish?
The name Solomon comes from a root meaning “peace. ”
King Solomon ruled from Jerusalem, the name of which means “Possession of Twofold Peace. ” His 40 - year reign was marked by unprecedented peace in the nation of Israel.
The Bible states concerning those years: “Judah and Israel continued to dwell in security, everyone under his own vine and under his own fig tree, from Dan to Beer - sheba, all the days of Solomon. ”
Still, Solomon, in all his wisdom, could not free his subjects from the shackles of sickness, sin, and death.
The Greater Solomon, though, will free his subjects from all of that. ​ — Read Romans 8: 19 - 21.
In the Christian congregation, what conditions do we enjoy?
Even now in the Christian congregation, we have peaceful conditions.
Indeed, we are enjoying a true spiritual paradise.
We have peace with God and with our fellow man.
Note what Isaiah prophesied about the conditions that we are experiencing today: “They will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore. ”
By acting in harmony with God’s spirit, we contribute to the beauty of the spiritual paradise.
19, 20.
What reasons do we have to rejoice?
However, the future will be even better.
As obedient humans enjoy peace to an unprecedented degree under Jesus ’ rule, they will gradually be “set free from enslavement to corruption ” until they reach human perfection.
After they pass the final test at the end of the Thousand Year Reign, “the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace. ”
Truly, Christ Jesus ’ rule will surpass Solomon’s in ways we cannot yet imagine!
As Israel rejoiced under the oversight of Moses, David, and Solomon, we will rejoice even more under Christ’s rulership.
All thanks to Jehovah for providing us with his only - begotten Son ​ — the Greater Moses, David, and Solomon!
The name David probably means “Beloved. ”
At the time of Jesus ’ baptism and again at his transfiguration, Jehovah spoke from heaven calling him “my Son, the beloved. ” ​ — Matt. 3: 17; 17: 5.
At the same time, David became like a trusting lamb. He looked to the Great Shepherd, Jehovah, for protection and guidance.
“Jehovah is my Shepherd, ” he said with complete confidence.
“I shall lack nothing. ”
John the Baptizer identified Jesus as “the Lamb of God. ” ​ — John 1: 29.
Interestingly, a second name for Solomon was Jedidiah, which means “Beloved of Jah. ” ​ — 2 Sam.
12: 24, 25.

Questions From Readers
Is there any hope of a resurrection for a baby that dies in its mother’s womb?
For those who have never suffered the loss of an unborn baby in this way, it may be difficult to imagine the feelings of those who have.
Some parents grieve such losses intensely.
One mother lost five children before they were born.
In time, she felt blessed to raise two healthy sons. Yet, she remembered each loss.
To the end of her days, she knew just how old her stillborn and miscarried babies would have been had they survived.
Do such Christians have a basis for hoping in a resurrection to restore what they have lost?
The simple answer to the question is that we do not know.
The Bible never directly addresses the matter of a resurrection for babies who were stillborn or lost through a miscarriage.
Nonetheless, God’s Word does contain principles that bear on the question and that may offer a measure of comfort.
Let us consider two related questions. First, from Jehovah’s viewpoint, when does the life of a human begin ​ — at conception or at birth?
Second, how does Jehovah view the unborn ​ — as unique individuals or as mere collections of cells and tissue in a woman’s womb?
Bible principles give clear answers to both questions.
The Mosaic Law clearly revealed that life begins, not at birth, but much earlier. How so?
It showed that killing a fetus could incur the death penalty.
Note this law: “You must give soul for soul. ”
* Thus, the unborn child in the womb is alive and is a living soul.
Understanding that timeless truth has helped millions of Christians to repudiate the practice of abortion, seeing it as a serious sin against God.
Granted, the unborn child is alive, but what value does Jehovah place on that life?
The law cited above demanded that an adult be put to death for causing the death of an unborn child.
Clearly, then, the life of an unborn child has great value in God’s eyes.
Further, numerous passages in the Scriptures reveal that Jehovah sees the unborn as distinct individuals.
For example, King David was inspired to say of Jehovah: “You kept me screened off in the belly of my mother....
Your eyes saw even the embryo of me, and in your book all its parts were down in writing, as regards the days when they were formed. ” ​ — Ps.
139: 13 - 16; Job 31: 14, 15.
Jehovah also sees that the unborn have distinct traits and may have great potential for the future.
While Isaac’s wife Rebekah was pregnant with twins, Jehovah uttered a prophecy about the two boys struggling in her womb, suggesting that he already saw traits in them that would have far - reaching effects. ​ — Gen.
25: 22, 23; Rom.
9: 10 - 13.
The case of John the Baptist is an interesting one as well.
The Gospel account says: “As Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the infant in her womb leaped; and Elizabeth was filled with holy spirit. ”
In describing this incident, the physician Luke used a Greek word that could refer either to a fetus or to a baby after its birth.
He used the same word in referring to the baby Jesus lying in the manger. ​ — Luke 2: 12, 16; 18: 15.
On the whole, does the Bible give us a basis for drawing a big distinction between a baby in the womb and one that has drawn its first breath?
It does not seem so. And that accords with the findings of modern science.
For example, researchers have learned that a baby in the womb is able to sense and respond to external stimuli.
Thus, it is not surprising that an expectant mother develops such a close bond with the child growing within her.
When the baby finally arrives, the timing of birth can seem quite arbitrary.
Consider this example: One mother gives birth prematurely to a living baby, who dies after a few days.
Another mother carries her baby to full term, but the child dies just before birth.
Is the first mother blessed with the hope that her child will be resurrected simply because of the happenstance of a premature birth, whereas the second mother has no such hope?
To summarize, then, the Bible clearly teaches that life begins at conception and that Jehovah sees the unborn child as a unique and valued individual.
In the light of those Scriptural truths, some might see it as inconsistent to argue that there is no hope for a resurrection of an unborn child that dies.
Indeed, they might feel that such an argument undermines our Scriptural stand against abortion, which is largely based on those very truths.
In the past, this journal has raised some practical questions that seem to cast doubt on the possibility of a resurrection for children who died before birth.
For example, would God implant even a partially developed embryo in the womb of a woman in Paradise?
However, further study and prayerful meditation has led the Governing Body to conclude that such considerations do not really have a bearing on the resurrection hope.
Jesus said: “All things are possible with God. ”
Does all of this mean, then, that the Bible teaches that children who perish before birth will be resurrected?
We must emphasize that the Bible does not directly answer that question, so there is no basis for humans to be dogmatic on the matter.
This subject may give rise to an almost endless variety of questions.
Really, though, it seems best to avoid speculation.
What we know is this: The matter rests with Jehovah God, who is abundant in loving - kindness and mercy.
Unquestionably, it is his heartfelt desire to undo death by means of the resurrection.
We can be confident that he always does what is right.
He will provide healing for the many wounds inflicted upon us by life in this wicked system of things as he lovingly directs his Son to “break up the works of the Devil. ” ​ — 1 John 3: 8.
This passage is sometimes translated in a way that implies that only the death of the mother would incur a death penalty.
However, the original Hebrew text shows that the law spoke of a fatal injury to either the mother or her unborn child.

Jehovah will provide healing for all painful experiences
Can You Serve Where the Need for Kingdom Publishers Is Greater?
“We led a comfortable life in the United States but were concerned that the materialistic environment there could eventually have a negative influence on us and our two sons.
My wife and I had formerly served as missionaries, and we wanted to enjoy that simple but happy kind of life again. ”
SPURRED by that desire, in 1991, Ralph and Pam decided to write to several branch offices to express their desire to serve where the need for Kingdom publishers is greater.
The branch office in Mexico responded that there was an urgent need for Kingdom publishers who could preach to the English - speaking population in that country.
In fact, that field, noted the branch, was “white for harvesting. ”
Before long, Ralph and Pam, with their sons, then aged 8 and 12, accepted the invitation and began to make preparations to move abroad.
A Vast Territory
Ralph recounts: “Before we left the United States, some well - meaning brothers and sisters told us: ‘ Moving abroad is too dangerous! ’ ‘ What if you get sick? ’ ‘ Why move to preach in an English - language territory?
English - speaking people there will not be interested in the truth! ’
However, our minds were made up.
After all, our decision to move was not an impulsive act.
We had been planning it for years.
We had avoided long - term debts, saved money, and had many family discussions about the difficulties we might encounter. ”
First, Ralph and his family visited the Mexico branch.
There, the brothers showed them a map of the entire country and told the new arrivals, “This is your territory! ”
The family settled in San Miguel de Allende, a town with a considerable foreign population, located some 150 miles [240 km] northwest of Mexico City.
Three years after their arrival, an English - speaking congregation of 19 publishers was formed in that town.
That was the first English - speaking congregation in Mexico ​ — but more work was waiting.
There are an estimated one million citizens of the United States living in Mexico.
Additionally, there are many Mexican professionals and students who speak English as a second language.
Ralph explains: “We prayed for more workers. We always kept an extra bedroom in our home available for brothers and sisters who came to our area to ‘ spy out the land, ’ so to speak. ” ​ — Num.
13: 2.
They Simplified Their Life to Expand Their Ministry
Soon more brothers and sisters who wanted to expand their ministry arrived.
Among them were Bill and Kathy from the United States.
They had already served for 25 years in territories where the need for publishers was great.
They were thinking of learning Spanish, but their plans changed after they moved to the town of Ajijic on the shores of Lake Chapala, which is a haven for retirees from the United States.
Bill explains, “In Ajijic we got ever more involved in seeking out English - speaking people who wanted to learn the truth. ”
Within two years after arriving in that town, Bill and Kathy had the joy of seeing the formation of a congregation ​ — the second English - language congregation in Mexico.
Ken and Joanne from Canada wanted to simplify their lives and devote more time to Kingdom activities. They too moved to Mexico.
Ken relates, “It took time to get used to living in a location where you may not have access to warm water, electricity, or telephone service for days. ”
However, sharing in the preaching work was a source of joy.
Ken was soon appointed to be a ministerial servant and two years later, an elder.
In the beginning, it was a challenge for their daughter Britanny to be part of a small English - language congregation with few other young people.
However, after she began sharing in Kingdom Hall building projects, she made many fine friends throughout the country.
Patrick and Roxanne from the state of Texas in the United States were excited to learn about a missionary field not too far away where people speak English.
“After visiting Monterrey, a town in northeastern Mexico, we felt that Jehovah was directing us to help there, ” says Patrick.
Within five days they were able to sell their home in Texas and to “step over into Macedonia, ” as it were.
Making a living in Mexico has not been easy, but in just two years, they had the joy of seeing a small group of 17 Witnesses grow into a congregation of 40 publishers.
They sold their spacious home in the United States and moved into a small apartment in Cancún, a city on Mexico’s east coast.
In the past, they were accustomed to attend assemblies in air - conditioned comfort close to home.
Now they had to travel eight hours to attend the nearest assembly in English, held in an open - air facility.
But they had the deep satisfaction of seeing in Cancún the formation of a congregation of some 50 publishers.
Some Mexican brothers and sisters also began to help with the preaching work in the English language.
For example, when Rubén and his family heard that the first English - language congregation had been formed in San Miguel de Allende and that all of Mexico was that congregation’s territory, they immediately decided to assist.
This meant learning English, getting accustomed to a different culture, and traveling long distances ​ — 500 miles [800 km] each week — ​ to attend the meetings.
Rubén relates: “We had the joy of witnessing to foreigners who have lived for years in Mexico but who heard the message of the good news in their own language for the first time.
Some of them expressed their appreciation to us with tears in their eyes. ”
After helping the congregation in San Miguel de Allende, Rubén and his family served as pioneers in the town of Guanajuato, in central Mexico, where they helped to form an English - language congregation of more than 30 publishers.
Today, they are serving in an English - speaking group in Irapuato, a town near Guanajuato.
Reaching Those Who Are Hard to Reach
In addition to foreigners, there are many Mexicans who speak English.
It is often difficult to share the Kingdom message with them because they live in affluent areas where maids answer the door.
Or if the householders do come to the door, they may not want to listen to our message because they think that Jehovah’s Witnesses are a small local sect.
Yet, when such householders are approached by Witnesses from abroad, some react favorably.
Consider the example of Gloria in the city of Querétaro, in central Mexico.
She explains: “I had been contacted before by Spanish - speaking Witnesses but did not listen to them.
However, when my family and friends started to have problems, I became depressed and turned to God in prayer, begging him to show me a way out.
Shortly thereafter, an English - speaking woman called at my door. She asked if anyone in the home spoke English.
Because she was a foreigner, I was curious about her, and I told her that I did speak English.
As she gave her presentation, I was thinking, ‘ What is this crazy American doing here in my neighborhood? ’
So maybe this foreigner was God’s answer to my prayer. ”
Gloria accepted a Bible study and progressed very quickly to baptism, in spite of family opposition.
Today, Gloria serves as a regular pioneer, and her husband and son also serve Jehovah.
Rewards for Those Who Expand Their Ministry
Serving where the need for Kingdom publishers is greater has its challenges, but the rewards are many.
Ralph, mentioned at the outset, states: “We conducted Bible studies with people from Britain, China, Jamaica, Sweden, and even with royalty from Ghana.
Some of these Bible students entered the full - time service themselves.
Over the past years, our family has witnessed the formation of seven English congregations.
Both our sons began pioneering with us, and they are now serving at Bethel in the United States. ”
In Mexico, there are presently 88 English - language congregations and numerous groups.
What accounts for such rapid growth?
Many English - speaking people in Mexico had never before been contacted by the Witnesses.
Others responded favorably because they did not feel the peer pressure that could have hindered them back in their homelands.
Still others accepted the offer to study the Bible because they had retired and had time to pursue spiritual interests.
In addition, more than one third of the publishers in the English - speaking congregations serve as pioneers, which contributes much to the enthusiasm and growth in those congregations.
Blessings Await You
No doubt more people around the world will respond favorably as they hear the Kingdom message preached to them in their own language.
It is therefore heartwarming to note that numerous spiritually - minded brothers and sisters ​ — young and old, single and married — ​ are willing to move to areas where the need for Kingdom proclaimers is great.
True, they may cope with hardships, but these fade away in comparison with the happiness they feel as they find honesthearted individuals who embrace Bible truths.
Could you make adjustments that would enable you to move to a territory in your own land or in a foreign country where the need for Kingdom preachers is greater?
* If so, you can be sure that rich blessings await you.
For more information on serving where the need is greater, see Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will, pages 111 - 112.

Happy Retirees Draw Attention
Beryl emigrated from Britain to Canada.
There she worked as a manager for several international companies.
She also became an accomplished equestrienne and was even chosen to represent Canada in the 1980 Olympics.
Upon retirement to Chapala, Mexico, Beryl and her husband often ate out in local restaurants.
When she noticed English - speaking retirees who appeared to be happy, she introduced herself to them and asked what they were doing in Mexico.
The happy diners almost always turned out to be Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Beryl and her husband thought that if happiness and a purpose in life come from knowing God, then they too wanted to know him.
After attending Christian meetings for several months, Beryl agreed to study the Bible and became a Witness. For several years, Beryl was able to serve as a regular pioneer.
[Box on page 22]
“It Is a Blessing to Have Them With Us ”
Those who move to lands where the need for Kingdom publishers is greater are much appreciated by the local brothers.
One branch office in the Caribbean wrote: “If the hundreds of foreigners who serve here were to leave, the stability of the congregations would be affected.
It is a blessing to have them with us. ”
God’s Word states that “the women telling the good news are a large army. ”
Thus, it is not surprising that there are many single sisters among those serving abroad. Such self - sacrificing sisters are of great help.
A branch office in Eastern Europe observed: “In many of our congregations, there is a high percentage of sisters, at times up to 70 percent.
Most of them are new in the truth, but single pioneer sisters who came from other lands provide invaluable assistance by training such new ones.
These sisters from abroad are a true gift to us! ”
How do such sisters feel about serving in foreign countries?
“The challenges are many, ” says Angelica, a sister in her mid - 30 ’ s who served several years abroad as a single pioneer.
“In one assignment, day after day, I trudged through muddy roads and was surrounded by depressing scenes of human suffering.
But I felt satisfaction in helping people in the ministry.
I was also touched by the many expressions of gratitude from local sisters who often thanked me for coming to help them.
One sister told me that my example in coming all the way to her country to serve as a pioneer had moved her also to take up full - time service. ”
Sue, a pioneer in her early 50 ’ s, says: “You are definitely faced with challenges, but these cannot compare with the blessings you receive.
The ministry is exciting!
Since I spend much time in service with young sisters, I share with them what I have learned from the Bible and our publications on how to deal with obstacles.
They often tell me that my example of coping with problems while serving for many years as a single pioneer helps them to see that they too can overcome challenges in their life.
Helping these sisters gives me a deep sense of fulfillment. ”

Questions From Readers ​ — Is there any hope of a resurrection for a baby that dies in its mother’s womb?
PAGE 12
PAGE 14
Can You Serve Where the Need for Kingdom Publishers Is Greater?
PAGE 20
Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of The Watchtower?
See if you can answer the following questions:
• Why is it so important that we keep our Christian integrity?
Keeping our integrity enables us to take our stand for Jehovah’s sovereignty out of love and to prove that Satan is a liar.
Our integrity also provides a basis on which God can judge us and is, therefore, essential to our hope for the future. ​ — 12 / 15, pages 4 - 6.
• What are some titles that reflect Jesus ’ role in God’s purpose? The only - begotten Son. The Word. The Amen.
The High Priest. The promised Seed. ​ — 12 / 15, page 15.
• Why is it significant that Elijah had his attendant look toward the sea while the prophet prayed for rain?
(1 Ki.
18: 43 - 45)
Elijah showed an awareness of the water cycle.
Clouds that formed over the sea would move over the land, where they could produce rain. ​ — 1 / 1, pages 15 - 16.
• How can we increase the joy we find in our ministry?
We can prepare our heart, focusing on how much we can help others.
We can preach with a view to starting Bible studies.
If we face apathy, we can adapt our approach to appeal to the interests of those in our territory. ​ — 1 / 15, pages 8 - 10.
• Was the leprosy mentioned in the Bible the disease known today as leprosy?
The bacterial infection called leprosy did exist in Biblical times. The Bible also speaks of leprosy that appeared in garments and houses.
That “leprosy ” may have referred to a type of mold or mildew. ​ — 2 / 1, page 19. • How should Bible teachings affect a Christian’s attitude and practices regarding funerals?
Though a Christian may mourn dead loved ones, he knows that the dead are unconscious.
Even if unbelievers criticize him, he avoids customs linked with the belief that the dead can influence the living. To avoid problems, some Christians put in writing their instructions as to funeral arrangements. ​ — 2 / 15, pages 29 - 31.
Instead, we should delight in the law of Jehovah. ​ — 3 / 1, page 17. • Are “the book of Jashar ” and“ the book of the Wars of Jehovah ” lost books of the Bible?
10: 13; Num.
21: 14)
No. It seems that they were uninspired documents that existed in Bible times and were referred to by Bible writers. ​ — 3 / 15, page 32.
Keys to Family Happiness
“Talking to my sons used to be pleasant. They listened carefully to what I had to say, and they responded immediately.
But now that they are teenagers, we have conflicts over everything.
They even question our spiritual routine.
‘ Do we really have to talk about the Bible? ’
they ask.
Before my sons hit puberty, I never imagined that this would happen to my family ​ — even when I saw it happen to others. ” ​ — Reggie.
* ARE you raising an adolescent?
If so, you are witnessing one of the most fascinating stages of your child’s growth. It can also be one of the most nerve - racking.
Do the following scenarios sound familiar?
When your son was younger, he was like a boat tied to a dock ​ — you.
Now as a teenager, he is tugging at the rope, eager to set sail, and you get the impression that you are not invited on board.
When your daughter was a child, she told you everything.
Now as a teenager, she has formed a ‘ social club ’ with her friends, and you feel as if you were not granted membership.
If something similar is happening in your home, do not hastily conclude that your child is becoming an irreformable rebel. What is happening then?
To answer that question, let us consider the pivotal role that adolescence plays in your child’s development.
From birth onward, a child’s life is a list of firsts ​ — the first steps taken, the first word spoken, the first day of school, to name just a few.
Parents rejoice when their child reaches a milestone.
The accomplishment provides evidence of something that they yearn to see ​ — growth.
Adolescence too is a milestone ​ — although some parents may not greet its arrival with applause.
Their apprehension is understandable. After all, what dad or mom is happy to see a compliant child turn into a moody teen?
Still, adolescence is a vital phase of growth.
The Bible states that in time “a man will leave his father and his mother. ”
A major function of adolescence is to help prepare your son or daughter for that bittersweet day.
At that time, your child should be able to say, as did the apostle Paul: “When I was a babe, I used to speak as a babe, to think as a babe, to reason as a babe; but now that I have become a man, I have done away with the traits of a babe. ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 13: 11.
In essence, that is what your son or daughter is doing during the teen years ​ — shedding the traits of childhood and learning to become a responsible young adult who is self - reliant and mature enough to leave home.
In fact, one reference work poignantly describes adolescence as “one long goodbye. ”
Granted, right now the very idea that your “little ” boy or girl will become independent may arouse your skepticism.
You might ask:
“If my son is not responsible enough to keep his room clean, how will he maintain an apartment? ”
“If my daughter is not dependable enough to keep her curfew, how will she keep a job? ”
If you wrestle with such concerns, remember this: Independence is not a door that your child simply walks through; it is a road that he or she travels, and it takes years to complete the journey.
For now, you know from observation that “foolishness is tied up with the heart of a boy ” ​ — or a girl. ​ — Proverbs 22: 15.
With proper guidance, however, your child will likely emerge from adolescence as a responsible young adult with his or her “perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong. ” ​ — Hebrews 5: 14.
To prepare your adolescent for adulthood, you need to help him develop his “power of reason ” so that he will be able to make sound decisions on his own.
* The following Bible principles will help you to do that.
Philippians 4: 5: “Let your reasonableness become known. ”
Your teenager makes a request, perhaps for a later curfew.
Your adolescent whines, “You’re treating me like a child! ”
Before replying, “Well, you’re acting like one, ” consider the following: Teenagers tend to demand more freedom than they can handle, but parents may tend to extend less freedom than they could grant.
Might it be that you could make a concession from time to time?
Why not at least think about your teen’s point of view?
TRY THIS: Write down one or two areas in which you could extend a little more freedom to your adolescent.
Explain to him that you are extending this freedom on a trial basis.
If he does not do so, the freedoms he has been granted will be curtailed. ​ — Matthew 25: 21.
Colossians 3: 21: “Fathers, do not nag your children.
If you are too hard to please, they may want to stop trying. ” ​ — International Children’s Bible.
Some parents try to micromanage their teen. To keep him in line, they all but lock him in the house.
They pick his friends for him and eavesdrop on his phone calls.
But these techniques can backfire. Confining him may only make him want to escape; constantly criticizing his friends might only increase their appeal; eavesdropping could compel him to find ways to communicate with his friends behind your back.
The more you try to gain control, the less control you may end up having.
Really, if your teen never learns to make decisions for himself while at home, how will he know how to make them after he leaves?
TRY THIS: The next time you talk to your teen about an issue, help him to reason on how his choices reflect on him.
For example, instead of criticizing his friends, say: “What if [name] got arrested for breaking the law?
How would that make you look? ”
Help your teen to see how his choices either enhance his reputation or tarnish it. ​ — Proverbs 11: 17, 22; 20: 11.
Ephesians 6: 4: “Do not be irritating your children, but go on bringing them up in the discipline and mental - regulating of Jehovah. ”
The term “mental - regulating ” refers to more than imparting facts.
It means to appeal to the moral consciousness of the child in such a way that it influences his actions.
This is especially crucial when your child becomes an adolescent.
“The older your children get, ” says a father named Andre,“ the more you need to adjust your approach and to reason with him. ” ​ — 2 Timothy 3: 14.
TRY THIS: When an issue arises, try reversing roles.
Ask your teen what advice he would give you if you were his child.
Have him do research to come up with reasons to support ​ — or challenge — ​ his thinking.
Discuss the matter again within a week.
Galatians 6: 7: “Whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap. ”
A child can be taught by means of punishment ​ — perhaps sending him to his room or denying him a favorite activity.
With an adolescent, you would do well to think more in terms of consequences. ​ — Proverbs 6: 27.
TRY THIS: Do not rescue him by paying off his debts or by making excuses to his teacher for a failing grade.
Let him feel the consequences, and the lesson will be long lasting.
As a parent, you probably wish that adolescence were like a runway down which your child could swiftly and efficiently pick up speed and take off into adulthood.
Rarely, though, is the takeoff that smooth.
Still, your child’s adolescence provides you with a wonderful opportunity to “train up a boy according to the way for him. ”
Bible principles are a solid foundation upon which you can build family happiness.
Name has been changed.
While we will refer to the child as a male, the principles discussed apply to both genders.
By the time he or she leaves home, will my adolescent be able to do the following?
maintain a regular spiritual routine
make good choices and decisions
effectively communicate with others
care for personal health
manage personal finances
clean and maintain a home or an apartment
Protect Yourself Against Wicked Spirits
JAMES was raised in a remote part of the island of Malaita, in the Solomon Islands.
From his youth on, he was taught to honor the spirits.
“I would never have considered appealing to the spirits to bring harm to others, ” he says,“ but I did not think it was possible to have a happy life without using rarafono [traditional practices that call for help from the spirits] for protection from harm. ”
As is the case of people in numerous other parts of the world, inhabitants of the Solomon Islands believe that spirits can either help or harm a person.
In fact, many Melanesians view so - called benevolent spirits with affection, not with fear.
Belief in the activity of spirits is manifest in a variety of ways.
For example, when James was young, women in his village would rush their children inside the house whenever they heard the call of the korokoro bird (common koel).
They believed that the bird’s call meant that someone was about to be harmed.
Some villagers place a special white stone above the doorway of their houses.
James did this, believing that the stone would protect him from harmful spirits.
And when James was at work, he would collect any scraps left over from his lunch and keep them in a bag to be disposed of later. His main concern was that a magic man would find the scraps and use them to cast a spell that would cause him to become ill.
Although these specific practices may not be common in your part of the world, perhaps like James you have felt the need to follow traditional customs in order to obtain protection from wicked spirits.
You may believe that adhering to such customs is essential to your welfare.
If you respect the Bible, you no doubt want to know what it says in answer to the following questions: (1) What harm can wicked spirits bring upon you?
(2) Could following some traditional customs actually cause you to fall under the influence of the demons?
(3) How can you find real protection from wicked spirits and be happy?
How Wicked Spirits Cause Harm
The Bible reveals that wicked spirits cannot possibly be the spirits of the dead.
“The living are conscious that they will die, ” states God’s Word,“ but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all. ”
Wicked spirits are, in fact, rebellious angels who have joined Satan in trying to mislead humans. ​ — Revelation 12: 9.
The Scriptures plainly state that we need protection from wicked spirits.
The apostle Paul wrote to the Christians in Ephesus: “We have a wrestling, not against blood and flesh, but against... the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places. ”
The apostle Peter described the ruler of all wicked spirits, Satan the Devil, as being like “a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone. ” ​ — Ephesians 6: 12; 1 Peter 5: 8.
Satan causes harm primarily by misleading people, tricking or tempting them into acting in a way that offends God.
The Bible says that Satan “keeps transforming himself into an angel of light. ”
He pretends to be a protective spirit, when in fact, his intent is wicked.
Satan blinds people’s minds to the truth about him and to the truth about God.
What is his goal in misleading people?
Satan craves worship and wants people, either knowingly or unknowingly, to give him such worship.
When God’s own Son, Jesus, was on earth, Satan wanted him to “fall down and do an act of worship ” to him.
Jesus said: “Go away, Satan! For it is written, ‘ It is Jehovah your God you must worship. ’ ”
Jesus refused to do anything that would imply worshipful submission to Satan.
Jehovah is the most powerful of all spirits and will not let any lasting harm come to those who obey him.
But if we are going to please Jehovah God as Jesus did, we need to avoid any act of submission to Satan or his demons.
To that end, we need to identify traditional practices that give worshipful honor to wicked spirit forces.
How can you do so?
Identify Customs That Displease God
Jehovah God warned his ancient people, the Israelites, against copying some of the traditional practices of nearby nations.
He said: “There should not be found in you anyone who... employs divination, a practicer of magic or anyone who looks for omens or a sorcerer, or one who binds others with a spell. ”
Regarding those who followed these customs, the Bible says: “Everybody doing these things is something detestable to Jehovah. ” ​ — Deuteronomy 18: 10 - 12.
Therefore, when considering customs prevalent in your area, consider the following questions: Does the custom encourage a belief in omens?
Does it attribute magical protective powers to inanimate objects?
Does it involve the casting of or protection from spells?
Will it involve an act of submission to a spirit other than Jehovah or his appointed representative, Jesus? ​ — Romans 14: 11; Philippians 2: 9, 10.
It is vital that you reject any customs that encourage such practices.
Why? The apostle Paul was inspired to write: “You cannot be partaking of ‘ the table of Jehovah ’ and the table of demons. ”
He warned that those who tried to please both God and other spirits would be “inciting Jehovah to jealousy. ”
Jehovah God demands and deserves exclusive devotion. ​ — Exodus 20: 4, 5.
Consider, too, this question: Does the custom promote the idea that a person is not responsible for his or her own actions?
For example, adultery and sex before marriage are frowned upon in many communities and are condemned in the Bible.
However, in some Pacific cultures, such practices might become acceptable if the girl claims that she has been “green leafed, ” * that is, she says that she has been impelled to have sex because of a spell placed on her.
The Bible, however, teaches that we are responsible for our actions.
For instance, the first woman, Eve, felt that she was deceived by Satan to participate in disobeying God, saying: “The serpent ​ — it deceived me and so I ate. ”
However, Jehovah held Eve accountable for her actions.
He also holds us accountable for our conduct. ​ — Hebrews 4: 13.
What Must You Do?
If you want to please God and live by Bible principles, you need to take decisive action.
Honesthearted individuals living in Ephesus in the first century set a good example in this regard.
To separate themselves from the influence of wicked spirits, they collected all the books they owned that dealt with spiritistic practices and “burned them up before everybody. ” ​ — Acts 19: 19.
Touched to the heart by Paul’s teaching about the Christ, they were moved to destroy their spiritistic books.
They also changed their feelings regarding their traditional practices.
True, abandoning traditional practices may not be easy to do.
He began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses and enjoyed what he learned.
However, he continued to practice rarafono.
On examining his feelings with regard to these practices, he found that he believed in Jehovah’s promises for the future but felt that to be protected from harm, he still needed to rely on traditional practices.
What helped James to change his outlook?
He says: “I prayed to Jehovah for his protection and for help to put my trust in him.
At the same time, I abandoned my traditional practices. ” Has any harm come to him?
“No, ” says James.“ All that has happened is that I have learned to trust in Jehovah.
I have seen how close Jehovah can be as a friend. ”
Why not follow James ’ example?
Examine the customs that are adhered to in your community, and use your “power of reason ” to determine if they are in harmony with the“ will of God. ”
If you do so, you can have confidence that Jehovah will “take you in ” and protect you.
Like James, you will experience the truthfulness of the Bible’s promise: “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower.
Into it the righteous runs and is given protection. ” ​ — Proverbs 18: 10.
This term refers to the custom of making an incantation over a special plant leaf or food.
This item is then given to a girl. The leaf or food is claimed to produce in the girl an attraction for a man.
This custom is not the same as when a girl is unknowingly drugged and then forced to have sex against her will.

Our Readers Ask
Is All Miraculous Healing From God?
There is no doubt that Jehovah God has the power to heal.
Also, there is no doubt that he can give that power to his worshippers.
For instance, during the time of the apostles, miraculous healing was one of the special gifts of his holy spirit.
The apostle Paul writes: “The manifestation of the spirit is given to each one for a beneficial purpose.
For example, to one there is given through the spirit speech of wisdom,... to another gifts of healings by that one spirit,... to another prophesying,... to another different tongues. ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 12: 4 - 11.
However, Paul also wrote in that same letter to the Corinthians that the miraculous gifts of God’s holy spirit would end.
He said: “Whether there are gifts of prophesying, they will be done away with; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will be done away with. ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 13: 8.
During the first century, miraculous healings were performed by Jesus Christ and his apostles.
At that time in Christian history, the gifts of the spirit, including the ability to perform healings, were for the glory of God and were a sign of Jehovah’s approval and blessing on the young Christian congregation.
But once mature or fully established, rather than pointing to special gifts, the Christian congregation would point to its display of unswerving faith, hope, and love as evidence of God’s approval.
Thus, about the year 100 C.E., miraculous healings as a mark of God’s favor ceased.
Yet, you may wonder, ‘ Why do I still hear reports of miraculous cures? ’
For example, one newspaper report told of a man who was purportedly afflicted with cancer.
He had tumors on his head, on his kidneys, and even deep inside his bones.
His future looked grim until the day that God “spoke ” with him.
A few days later, his cancer was gone, the report said.
When confronted with such a story, why not ask yourself: ‘ Is this report factual?
Is there documented, clinical evidence to support the claim?
And even if there did seem to be a cure, does the Bible teach that God is responsible for all occurrences that appear to be miraculous healings? ’
The answer to that last question is particularly important.
Jesus cautioned his followers: “Be on the watch for the false prophets...
Many will say to me in that day, ‘ Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works [miracles] in your name? ’
And yet then I will confess to them: I never knew you!
Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness. ” ​ — Matthew 7: 15, 21 - 23.
Clearly, so - called miraculous healing can come from a source other than God.
To avoid being deceived by those who claim to work miracles in God’s name, we need to gain accurate knowledge of God, to use our God - given ability to reason, and to learn how to identify those who are doing his will. ​ — Matthew 7: 16 - 19; John 17: 3; Romans 12: 1, 2.
Evidently, with the death of the apostles, the transmittal of the gifts ended, and the miraculous gifts of the spirit ceased altogether as those who had received these gifts died.
Press On to Maturity ​ — “The Great Day of Jehovah Is Near ”
“Let us press on to maturity. ” ​ — HEB. 6: 1.
1, 2.
What opportunity to ‘ flee to the mountains ’ opened up for first - century Christians in Jerusalem and Judea?
WHEN Jesus was on earth, his disciples approached him and asked: “What will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things? ”
The initial fulfillment of the prophecy that Jesus gave them in answer to their question took place in the first century.
Jesus spoke of an unusual development that would signal that the end was imminent.
Upon observing that development, “those in Judea [were to] begin fleeing to the mountains. ”
Would Jesus ’ disciples recognize the sign and act on his instructions?
Nearly three decades later, in 61 C.E., the apostle Paul penned a strong, sobering message to Hebrew Christians living in Jerusalem and its surroundings.
Unknown to both Paul and his fellow believers, the signal marking the opening stage of a “great tribulation ” was only about five years away.
In 66 C.E., Cestius Gallus led Roman troops in a nearly successful attack on Jerusalem.
But then he suddenly withdrew, leaving open a window of opportunity for endangered ones to escape to safety.
What exhortation did Paul give to Hebrew Christians, and why?
Those Christians needed keen discernment and spiritual perception to recognize the turn of events and flee. However, some had become “dull in [their] hearing. ”
They were like spiritual babes needing “milk. ”
(Read Hebrews 5: 11 - 13.)
Even some of those who had walked in the way of the truth for decades were showing signs of “drawing away from the living God. ”
Some had “the custom ” of missing Christian meetings at a time when this calamitous“ day [was] drawing near. ”
Paul gave them timely exhortation, saying: “Now that we have left the primary doctrine about the Christ, let us press on to maturity. ” ​ — Heb.
6: 1.
“The great day of Jehovah ” ​ — the day that will bring the end of Satan’s entire system — ​“ is near. ”
Are we really doing that?
Christian maturity will help us to stay focused on where we are in the stream of time.
What Christian Maturity Is
5, 6. (a) What does spiritual maturity involve?
(b) Pressing on to maturity requires effort in what two areas?
Paul not only encouraged the first - century Hebrew Christians to press on to maturity but also told them what spiritual maturity involves. (Read Hebrews 5: 14.)
“Mature people ” are not content to partake only of“ milk. ” They take in “solid food. ”
Therefore, they know both “the elementary things ” and“ the deep things ” of the truth.
Moreover, their perceptive powers are trained through use ​ — through application of what they know — ​ helping them to distinguish right from wrong.
When they are faced with a decision, this training enables them to discern what Scriptural principles are involved and how to apply them.
“It is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things heard by us, ” wrote Paul,“ that we may never drift away. ”
Such drifting away from the faith can happen before we realize it.
We can avoid having this experience by paying “more than the usual attention ” during our consideration of spiritual truths.
Therefore, each of us needs to ask: ‘ Am I still considering just elementary things?
Could I merely be going through the motions and floating along, as it were, without my heart being fully involved with the truth?
How can I make genuine spiritual progress? ’ Pressing on to maturity calls for our putting forth effort in at least two areas.
We must get well - acquainted with the Word of God. And we need to learn obedience.
Become Well - Acquainted With the Word
How can we benefit from becoming better acquainted with the Word of God?
“Everyone that partakes of milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, ” wrote Paul,“ for he is a babe. ”
To attain maturity, we must become well - acquainted with God’s word, his message to us.
Since this message is contained in his Word, the Bible, we should be good students of the Scriptures and the publications of “the faithful and discreet slave. ”
Absorbing God’s thinking in this way can help us to train our perceptive powers.
Consider the example of a Christian named Orchid.
* She says: “The reminder that has had the biggest effect on my life is the one about regular Bible reading.
It took me about two years to finish the whole Bible, but it seemed that I was meeting my Creator for the first time. I learned about his ways, his likes and his dislikes, the degree of his power, and the depth of his wisdom.
Reading the Bible daily has sustained me through some of the darkest moments of my life. ”
What power can the Word of God exert on us?
Regularly reading a portion of God’s Word allows its message to ‘ exert power ’ on us. (Read Hebrews 4: 12.)
Such reading can mold our inner person and make us more pleasing to Jehovah.
Do you have a personal need to schedule more time to read the Bible and meditate on what it says?
9, 10.
What does becoming acquainted with God’s Word involve?
Becoming acquainted with the Bible involves more than being familiar with what it says.
Spiritual babes of Paul’s day were not necessarily completely unfamiliar with God’s inspired Word.
However, they did not personally use it and test its value by actual practice.
They did not acquaint themselves with the message by allowing it to guide them in making wise decisions in their lives.
To become acquainted with the Word of God means to know what it says and to put that knowledge into practice.
The experience of a Christian sister named Kyle shows how this can be done.
Kyle had an altercation with one of her workmates.
What did she do to heal the breach?
She explains: “The scripture that readily came to my mind was Romans 12: 18, which says: ‘ As far as it depends upon you, be peaceable with all men. ’
So I made an appointment to meet this workmate after work. ”
The meeting was very successful, and the fellow employee was impressed that Kyle had taken that step.
“I learned that we can never go wrong if we apply Bible principles, ” says Kyle.
Learn Obedience
What shows that obedience under difficult circumstances can be a challenge?
Applying what we have learned from the Scriptures can be a challenge, particularly when circumstances are difficult.
For example, shortly after Jehovah liberated the sons of Israel from Egyptian bondage, they “fell to quarreling with Moses ” and kept“ putting Jehovah to the test. ”
Because of a lack of water to drink.
Less than two months after entering into a divine covenant and agreeing to do “all the words that Jehovah [had] spoken, ” they violated his law on idolatry.
Did they perhaps think that the Amalekites would strike again and that the Israelites would be helpless without Moses, whose upheld hands had brought them victory earlier?
That is possible, but whatever the case, the Israelites “refused to become obedient. ”
Paul urged Christians to ‘ do their utmost ’ to avoid ‘ falling into the same pattern of disobedience ’ that the Israelites showed when they were afraid to enter the Promised Land. ​ — Heb.
4: 3, 11.
How did Jesus learn obedience, and with what benefit?
Pressing on to maturity requires that we do our utmost to obey Jehovah.
As exemplified by Jesus Christ, obedience is often learned from the things suffered.
(Read Hebrews 5: 8, 9.)
Before coming to earth, Jesus was obedient to his Father.
However, doing his Father’s will on earth involved physical and mental suffering.
Through obedience under extreme adversity, Jesus was “made perfect ” for the new position God had in mind for him, that of being King and High Priest.
What shows whether we have learned obedience? What about us?
Are we determined to obey Jehovah even when we are faced with distressful problems?
(Read 1 Peter 1: 6, 7.)
God’s counsel regarding morals, honesty, proper use of the tongue, personal reading and study of the Scriptures, attendance at Christian meetings, and participation in the preaching work is clear.
Are we obedient to Jehovah in these matters even under adversity?
Our obedience is an indication that we have progressed toward maturity.
Christian Maturity ​ — Why Beneficial?
Illustrate how pressing on to maturity can be a protection.
It is a real protection for a Christian to have perceptive powers that are properly trained to distinguish right from wrong in a world that is “past all moral sense. ”
For example, a brother named James, who regularly read and deeply appreciated Scriptural publications, accepted a job where all his coworkers were women.
“While many of these clearly showed a lack of moral sense, ” says James,“ one employee seemed to be of good character and showed interest in Bible truth.
When we were alone in a production room, though, she began making sexual advances.
I thought it was a joke but found it very hard to stop her.
Right then I recalled an experience related in The Watchtower regarding a brother who faced a similar temptation on his job.
* I promptly pushed the girl away, and she ran out. ”
James was thankful that nothing further happened and that he maintained a good conscience. ​ — 1 Tim.
1: 5.
How can pressing on to maturity strengthen our figurative heart?
Maturity is also beneficial in that it strengthens our figurative heart and keeps us from being “carried away with various and strange teachings. ”
(Read Hebrews 13: 9.)
When we strive to make spiritual progress, our mind stays focused on “the more important things. ”
We thus grow in our appreciation for God and for all the provisions he has made for our benefit.
A Christian who is “full - grown in powers of understanding ” develops such gratitude and enjoys intimacy with Jehovah. ​ — 1 Cor.
14: 20. What helped one sister to develop ‘ firmness of heart ’?
A sister named Louise admitted that for some time after baptism, her main concern was the impression she gave to others.
“I was not doing anything wrong, ” she said,“ but my heart was not ablaze with the desire to serve Jehovah.
I realized that I had to make some changes if I was going to feel that I was giving everything I could to Jehovah. The biggest change was to throw my whole heart into his worship. ”
By putting forth such effort, Louise developed ‘ firmness of heart, ’ and it proved to be vital when she faced a distressing health problem.
Louise said, “I struggled greatly, but I really drew close to Jehovah. ”
‘ Become Obedient From the Heart ’
Why was obedience especially vital in the first century?
Paul’s counsel to “press on to maturity ” proved to be lifesaving to the first - century Christians living in Jerusalem and Judea.
Those who heeded it had the keen spiritual discernment needed to recognize the signal Jesus had given for them to “begin fleeing to the mountains. ”
When they saw “the disgusting thing that causes desolation... standing in a holy place, ” that is, the armies of Rome surrounding and penetrating Jerusalem, they knew that it was time to flee.
Heeding Jesus ’ prophetic warning, Christians fled the city of Jerusalem prior to its destruction and, according to ecclesiastical historian Eusebius, settled in the city of Pella in the mountainous region of Gilead.
They thereby avoided the worst disaster for Jerusalem in recorded history.
18, 19. (a) Why is obedience vital in our day?
(b) What will be considered in the next article?
Obedience that comes from pressing on to maturity will prove to be no less lifesaving when we face the major fulfillment of Jesus ’ prophecy that “there will be great tribulation ” of unequaled magnitude.
Will we prove to be obedient to whatever future urgent direction we may receive from “the faithful steward ”?
How important it is that we learn to ‘ become obedient from the heart ’! ​ — Rom. 6: 17.
Our attaining maturity requires that we train our perceptive powers.
We do this by putting forth effort to get better acquainted with God’s Word and by learning obedience.
Growing to Christian maturity brings special challenges to youths.
The following article considers how such challenges can be met successfully.
Some names have been changed.
See the article entitled “Fortified to Say No to Wrongdoing, ” in the October 1, 1999, issue of The Watchtower.

Following Jesus ’ counsel was lifesaving for early Christians
Youths ​ — Make Your Advancement Manifest
“Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons. ” ​ — 1 TIM.
4: 15. What does God desire for young people?
Let your heart lead you to enjoyment in the days of your youth. ” So wrote wise King Solomon of ancient Israel.
The Originator of this message, Jehovah God, certainly wants you youths to be happy.
More than that, Jehovah wants your joy to last beyond the time of youth.
However, those days of youth are often marred by painful mistakes that may affect a person’s future happiness.
Even faithful Job bemoaned having to face “the consequences of the errors of [his] youth. ”
During adolescence and the following early years of life, a young Christian often has to make weighty decisions.
Bad judgment can leave deep emotional scars and create problems that may affect the rest of his life. ​ — Eccl.
11: 10.
By applying what Bible counsel can youths avoid serious mistakes?
Consider the advice the apostle Paul gave to the Corinthians.
He wrote: “Do not become young children in powers of understanding... Become full - grown in powers of understanding. ”
Heeding the counsel to acquire the ability to think and reason like a full - grown person will help young people to avoid making serious mistakes.
What can you do to become mature?
If you are a young person, bear in mind that becoming mature requires effort.
Paul told Timothy: “Let no man ever look down on your youth. On the contrary, become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness....
Continue applying yourself to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching....
Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons. ”
Christian youths need to make progress and make their advancement manifest to others.
What Is Advancement?
What does making spiritual advancement involve?
To advance is “to progress, to change for the better. ”
Paul was urging Timothy to keep applying himself in order to make progress in speech, conduct, love, faith, and chasteness, as well as in the way he fulfilled his ministry.
He was to strive to make his manner of life exemplary.
Timothy thus needed to continue to make spiritual advancement.
5, 6. (a) When did Timothy’s advancement begin to be manifest?
(b) With regard to making advancement, how can youths today imitate Timothy?
When Paul penned this counsel sometime between 61 and 64 C.E., Timothy was already an experienced elder.
He was not just beginning to make spiritual advancement. In 49 or 50 C.E. when Timothy was likely in his late teens or early 20 ’ s, he was “well reported on by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium, ” who had observed his spiritual progress.
At that time, Paul took Timothy with him on his missionary journey.
After observing Timothy’s further progress for some months, Paul dispatched him to Thessalonica in order to comfort and make firm the Christians in that city. (Read 1 Thessalonians 3: 1 - 3, 6.)
Clearly, Timothy began to make his advancement manifest to others when he was a young person.
You young people in the congregation, work to cultivate the needed spiritual qualities now, so that your advancement in Christian living and in your ability to teach Bible truths will be clearly seen.
From the age of 12, Jesus “went on progressing in wisdom. ”
Let us, then, examine how you can make your advancement manifest in three areas of your life: (1) when you face adversity, (2) as you prepare for marriage, and (3) as you strive to become “a fine minister. ” ​ — 1 Tim. 4: 6.
Meet Adversity With “Soundness of Mind ”
How can adversity affect young people?
A 17 - year - old Christian named Carol said, “At times, I have been emotionally, physically, and mentally drained to the point that I didn’t want to wake up in the morning. ”
* Why was she so distressed?
When Carol was ten years old, her family was shattered by divorce, and she ended up living with her mother, who rejected the Bible’s moral standards.
Like Carol, you may be facing some severely stressful situations with little chance of improvement.
With what adversities did Timothy struggle?
While making spiritual progress, Timothy too struggled with adverse circumstances.
For instance, he experienced “frequent cases of sickness ” because of stomach trouble.
When Paul sent him to Corinth to handle certain problems caused by individuals who had challenged the apostle’s authority, Paul urged the congregation to cooperate, so that Timothy would be “free of fear ” among them. Evidently, Timothy was shy, or timid.
What is soundness of mind, and how does it differ from a spirit of cowardice?
To help Timothy, Paul later reminded him: “God gave us not a spirit of cowardice, but that of power and of love and of soundness of mind. ”
“Soundness of mind ” involves being able to think and reason sensibly.
It includes the ability to face things as they are ​ — not the way you would like them to be.
Some immature youths manifest a spirit of cowardice and mentally try to escape stressful situations by resorting to excessive sleep or TV viewing, drug or alcohol abuse, constant partying, or sexual immorality.
Christians are admonished “to repudiate ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things. ” ​ — Titus 2: 12.
10, 11.
How does soundness of mind help us to develop spiritual strength? The Bible exhorts “younger men to be sound in mind. ”
Heeding this counsel means that you will face problems prayerfully and will rely on God - given strength.
(Read 1 Peter 4: 7.)
Thus, you will develop heartfelt confidence in “the strength that God supplies. ” ​ — 1 Pet.
4: 11. Soundness of mind and prayer are what helped Carol.
“Having to take a stand against my mother’s immoral lifestyle was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, ” she said.
“But prayer really helped.
I know Jehovah is with me, so I am not afraid anymore. ”
Remember, adversity can refine and strengthen you.
Regardless of what you face, God will never let you down.
He will “really help you. ” ​ — Isa.
41: 10.
Preparing for a Successful Marriage
Why should a Christian considering marriage apply the principle found at Proverbs 20: 25?
Some young adults have rushed into marriage, believing that it is the solution to unhappiness, loneliness, boredom, and problems at home.
However, the exchanging of marriage vows is a serious matter.
Some in Bible times rashly made a sacred, or holy, vow without carefully analyzing what was involved. (Read Proverbs 20: 25.)
At times, young adults do not seriously consider the demands of marriage.
Later, they find that much more is involved than they had realized.
What questions should those contemplating courtship consider, and what helpful advice is available to them?
So before pursuing a courtship, ask yourself: ‘ Why do I want to get married?
What expectations do I have?
Is this the right person for me?
What can I bring to a marriage? ’
To help you make an insightful examination, “the faithful and discreet slave ” has published very specific articles.
* View such material as advice that Jehovah is giving you.
Carefully evaluate what is stated there and apply it.
Never allow yourself to become “like a horse or mule without understanding. ”
Become full - grown in your understanding of the demands of marriage.
If you feel that you are ready to pursue a courtship, always remember to be “an example... in chasteness. ” ​ — 1 Tim.
4: 12. How can spiritual advancement help you if you marry?
Spiritual maturity also brings success after marriage.
A full - grown Christian strives to attain “the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the Christ. ” He works hard to develop a Christlike personality.
As our Exemplar, “the Christ did not please himself. ”
When both mates keep seeking, not their own advantage, but that of the other, family life will be a haven of peace and comfort.
A husband will show self - sacrificing love, and a wife will be determined to be in submission to her husband as Jesus is to his Head. ​ — 1 Cor. 11: 3; Eph.
5: 25. “Fully Accomplish Your Ministry ”
15, 16.
How can you make your advancement manifest in the ministry?
Drawing attention to Timothy’s important assignment, Paul wrote: “I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus,... preach the word, be at it urgently. ”
He added: “Do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry. ”
To fulfill this charge, Timothy had to be “nourished with the words of the faith. ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 4: 6.
How can you be “nourished with the words of the faith ”?
Paul wrote: “Continue applying yourself to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them. ”
Improvement requires diligent personal study.
The expression “be absorbed ” conveys the idea of being immersed in an activity.
How are your study habits?
Are you absorbed in “the deep things of God ”?
Or do you put forth only minimal effort?
Pondering over what you study will move your heart. ​ — Read Proverbs 2: 1 - 5.
17, 18. (a) What abilities should you strive to cultivate?
(b) How will developing the same disposition as that of Timothy help you in the ministry?
A young pioneer named Michelle said: “To be truly effective in the ministry, I have a good schedule for personal study, and I am regular at the meetings.
As a result of this, I am always growing spiritually. ”
Serving as a pioneer will indeed help you to improve your ability to use the Bible in the ministry and to make spiritual advancement.
Strive to be a good reader and to give meaningful comments at Christian meetings.
As a spiritually mature youth, you would want to prepare instructive student talks in the Theocratic Ministry School, adhering to the assigned material.
‘ Doing the work of an evangelizer ’ means making your ministry more effective and helping others to gain salvation.
This requires developing the “art of teaching. ”
By arranging to share in the ministry with those who are experienced in this work, you will be able to learn from their teaching methods, as Timothy learned from working with Paul.
Referring to those he had helped, Paul said that he not only shared the good news with them but also gave of his ‘ own soul, ’ or used his very life in helping them, because they became beloved to him.
To follow Paul’s example in the ministry, you must have the same disposition as Timothy, who genuinely cared about others and ‘ slaved in furtherance of the good news. ’ (Read Philippians 2: 19 - 23.)
Do you show this self - sacrificing spirit in your ministry?
Advancement Brings Real Satisfaction
19, 20.
Why does making spiritual advancement bring joy?
Making spiritual advancement takes effort.
But by patiently cultivating your teaching skills, you will, in time, have the privilege of “making many rich ” spiritually, and they will become your“ joy or crown of exultation. ”
“More than ever before, my time is spent helping others, ” explained Fred, a full - time minister.
“It is so true that there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving. ”
Regarding the joy and satisfaction she experienced from growing spiritually, a young pioneer named Daphne said: “I developed a much closer relationship with Jehovah as I began to appreciate him as a Person.
When you please Jehovah to the fullest extent of your ability, you feel so good ​ — really satisfied! ”
Though spiritual advancement may not always be recognized by humans, Jehovah always sees and values it.
Without question, you young Christians can bring glory and praise to our heavenly Father.
Continue to make his heart rejoice as you genuinely make your advancement manifest. ​ — Prov.
27: 11.

The Angels ​ — “Spirits for Public Service ”
“Are they not all spirits for public service, sent forth to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation? ” ​ — HEB.
1: 14. What comfort can we draw from Matthew 18: 10 and Hebrews 1: 14?
JESUS CHRIST warned any who might stumble his followers: “See to it that you men do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven. ”
Referring to the righteous angels, the apostle Paul wrote: “Are they not all spirits for public service, sent forth to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation? ”
Those words are a comforting assurance that God uses these heavenly creatures to help humans.
What does the Bible tell us about angels?
How do they assist us?
What can we learn from their examples?
2, 3.
What are some duties of heavenly spirit creatures?
There are millions of faithful angels in heaven. All of them are “mighty in power, carrying out his word. ”
These spirit sons of God have personality, divine qualities, and free will.
They are superbly organized and have high positions in God’s arrangement, the archangel being Michael (Jesus ’ heavenly name).
This “firstborn of all creation ” is“ the Word, ” or Spokesman, of God and was used by Jehovah in making all other things. ​ — Col.
1: 15 - 17; John 1: 1 - 3.
Under the archangel are the seraphs, who declare Jehovah’s holiness and help to keep his people clean spiritually.
There are also the cherubs, who serve as upholders of his majesty.
Other angels, or messengers, have various duties in carrying out God’s will. ​ — Heb.
12: 22, 23.
How did the angels react to the founding of the earth, and what could the proper exercise of free will have meant for humans?
All the angels rejoiced at the ‘ founding of the earth ’ and shared with delight in their assigned work as this unique jewel in space developed into mankind’s home.
Jehovah created man “a little lower than angels ” but in His“ image, ” thus enabling humans to reflect the Creator’s lofty qualities.
By exercising the gift of free will properly, Adam and Eve and their descendants could have enjoyed life in a paradise home as part of Jehovah’s universal family of intelligent creatures.
5, 6.
What revolt took place in heaven, and how did God respond?
Surely the holy angels must have been appalled when they witnessed the beginning of revolt in God’s household.
One from their midst was no longer content with praising Jehovah but desired to be worshipped.
He made himself Satan (meaning “Resister ”) by challenging the rightfulness of Jehovah’s rulership and by launching an ambitious attempt to set up a rival sovereignty.
With the first recorded lie, Satan slyly induced the first human pair to join him in rebelling against their loving Creator. ​ — Gen.
3: 4, 5; John 8: 44.
Jehovah quickly rendered judgment against Satan by stating in the first Bible prophecy: “I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel. ”
Enmity would persist between Satan and God’s “woman. ”
Yes, Jehovah viewed the heavenly organization of faithful spirit creatures as a beloved wife bonded with him as Husband.
This prophecy provided a sure basis for hope, although the details remained a “sacred secret ” to be revealed progressively.
God purposed that one from within the heavenly part of his organization would crush all rebels and that through him “the things in the heavens and the things on the earth ” would be brought together. ​ — Eph.
1: 8 - 10.
What did some angels do in Noah’s day, and with what consequence for them?
In Noah’s day, a number of angels left their “proper dwelling place ” and materialized fleshly bodies in order to pursue selfish pleasure on earth.
Jehovah cast those rebels into dense darkness, and they thus joined Satan in becoming “wicked spirit forces ” and vicious foes of God’s servants. ​ — Eph. 6: 11 - 13; 2 Pet.
2: 4. How Do Angels Assist Us?
8, 9.
How has Jehovah used angels to assist humans?
Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, Isaiah, Daniel, Jesus, Peter, John, and Paul are among those who were ministered to by angels.
Righteous angels executed God’s judgments and transmitted prophecies and directions, including the Mosaic Law.
Since we now have the complete Word of God, angels may not need to convey divine messages.
Behind the scenes, however, the angels are very busy carrying out God’s will and supporting his servants.
The Bible assures us: “The angel of Jehovah is camping all around those fearing him, and he rescues them. ”
Because of the issue of integrity, Jehovah permits Satan to bring all sorts of trials upon us.
However, God knows the point beyond which a test would prove nothing more as far as our integrity to him is concerned.
(Read 1 Corinthians 10: 13.)
Angels are ever alert to intervene according to God’s will.
They rescued Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, Daniel, and Peter but did not prevent the deaths of Stephen and James at enemy hands.
The circumstances and issues were different.
Similarly, some of our brothers in Nazi concentration camps were executed, whereas Jehovah saw to it that most of them survived.
In addition to angelic help, what assistance may we receive?
The Scriptures do not teach that each person on earth has a guardian angel.
We pray in confidence that “no matter what it is that we ask according to his will, [God] hears us. ”
Of course, Jehovah could send an angel to assist us, but help may come in a different manner.
Fellow Christians may be motivated to provide help and comfort.
God may give us the wisdom and inner strength needed to cope with “a thorn in the flesh ” that afflicts us as if we were being slapped by“ an angel of Satan. ” ​ — 2 Cor.
12: 7 - 10; 1 Thess.
5: 14. Imitate Jesus
How were angels used to help Jesus, and what did he accomplish by remaining faithful to God?
Consider how Jehovah used angels in the case of Jesus.
They announced his birth and resurrection and ministered to him when he was on earth.
The angels could have prevented his arrest and cruel death.
Instead, however, an angel was sent to strengthen him.
In accord with Jehovah’s purpose, Jesus died a sacrificial death and furnished proof that a perfect man can maintain integrity to God despite being tested to the limit.
Jehovah therefore resurrected Jesus to immortal heavenly life, giving him “all authority ” and making angels subject to him.
Jesus thus proved to be the principal part of the “seed ” of God’s“ woman. ” ​ — Gen.
3: 15; Gal.
3: 16.
In what way can we imitate Jesus ’ balanced example?
Jesus knew that it was wrong for him to put Jehovah to the test by expecting angels to rescue him if he were to engage in reckless behavior. (Read Matthew 4: 5 - 7.)
So let us imitate Jesus ’ example by living with “soundness of mind, ” not taking unnecessary risks, yet facing persecution confidently. ​ — Titus 2: 12.
What We Can Learn From the Faithful Angels
What can we learn from the example of the righteous angels mentioned at 2 Peter 2: 9 - 11?
In reproving those who “speak abusively ” of Jehovah’s anointed servants, the apostle Peter points to the fine example of the righteous angels.
Although they have great power, the angels humbly refrain from making judgmental accusations “out of respect for Jehovah. ”
(Read 2 Peter 2: 9 - 11.)
Let us also keep free from improper judging, respect those entrusted with oversight in the congregation, and leave matters in the hands of Jehovah, the Supreme Judge. ​ — Rom.
12: 18, 19; Heb.
13: 17.
Although there are millions of spirit creatures in heaven, the Bible reveals the names of only Michael and Gabriel.
This may serve as a safeguard against our giving angels undue honor.
When the apostle John fell down to worship before an angel, he was admonished: “Be careful! Do not do that!
All I am is a fellow slave of you and of your brothers. ”
Our worship, including our prayers, should go only to God. ​ — Read Matthew 4: 8 - 10.
How do the angels set an example for us in patience?
The angels also set an example in patience.
Though they are intensely interested in knowing God’s sacred secrets, they are not privy to all of them.
“Into these very things angels are desiring to peer, ” states the Bible.
So, what do they do?
They wait patiently until God’s due time for his “diversified wisdom ” to“ be made known through the congregation. ” ​ — Eph. 3: 10, 11.
How can our conduct affect the angels?
Christians under trial are ‘ a theatrical spectacle to angels. ’
With great satisfaction, the angels observe our acts of faithfulness and even rejoice over the repentance of a sinner.
The godly conduct of Christian women is noted by the angels.
The Bible shows that “the woman ought to have a sign of authority upon her head because of the angels. ”
Yes, angels are pleased to see Christian women and all other earthly servants of God comply with theocratic order and headship.
Such obedience is a fitting reminder for these heavenly sons of God.
Angels Actively Support the Preaching Work
17, 18.
Why can we say that angels support our preaching?
Angels are involved in some of the remarkable things that occur in “the Lord’s day. ”
These include the birth of the Kingdom in 1914 and the hurling of Satan and his demons from heaven by “Michael and his angels. ”
The apostle John saw an “angel flying in midheaven, and he had everlasting good news to declare as glad tidings to those who dwell on the earth. ”
The angel declared: “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived, and so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters. ”
Jehovah’s servants are thus assured of angelic backing as they preach the good news of the established Kingdom despite the Devil’s vicious opposition. ​ — Rev.
12: 13, 17. Today, angels do not lead us to honesthearted ones by speaking to us as an angel spoke to Philip and directed him to the Ethiopian eunuch.
However, many modern - day experiences give evidence that angels behind the scenes are supporting our Kingdom - preaching work and guiding us to those “rightly disposed for everlasting life. ”
* How important it is to share in the ministry regularly so that we are available to do our part in finding those desiring to “worship the Father with spirit and truth ”! ​ — John 4: 23, 24.
19, 20.
What part do angels have in the events marking “the conclusion of the system of things ”?
Pointing to our day, Jesus said that “in the conclusion of the system of things, ” the angels would“ separate the wicked from among the righteous. ” Angels play a role in the final gathering and sealing of anointed ones.
(Read Matthew 24: 31; Rev.
7: 1 - 3) Moreover, Jesus is accompanied by angels when he “separates the sheep from the goats. ” ​ — Matt.
25: 31 - 33, 46. “At the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels ” all“ who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus ” will be destroyed.
When John saw that same event in vision, he described Jesus and the angelic heavenly armies as going forth on white horses in order to carry on war in righteousness. ​ — Rev.
19: 11 - 14.
What action will the angel “with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand ” take against Satan and his demons?
John also “saw an angel coming down out of heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. ”
This is none other than the archangel Michael, who will bind the Devil and hurl him ​ — and evidently the demons — ​ into the abyss.
They will be released briefly at the end of Christ’s Millennial Reign when perfect mankind will experience a final test.
Thereafter, Satan and all other rebels will suffer destruction.
All rebellion against God will have been removed.
How are the angels involved in what is just ahead, and how should we feel about their role?
Grand deliverance from Satan’s wicked system of things is just ahead.
Angels will have a definite role in these significant events that will vindicate Jehovah’s sovereignty and bring to complete fulfillment his purpose for the earth and mankind.
The righteous angels are indeed “spirits for public service, sent forth to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation. ”
Let us therefore be thankful to Jehovah God for the way he uses the angels to help us do the divine will and gain everlasting life.

Why Follow “the Christ ”?
“If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself... and follow me continually. ” ​ — LUKE 9: 23.
1, 2.
Why is it important for us to consider why we should follow “the Christ ”?
HOW delighted Jehovah must feel to see among the congregated throngs of his worshippers on earth you newly interested ones and young ones!
As you continue to study the Bible, attend Christian meetings regularly, and grow in your knowledge of the lifesaving truth found in God’s Word, you need to take to heart Jesus ’ invitation: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and follow me continually. ”
Jesus is saying that disowning yourself and becoming his follower is something you would want to do.
It is important for us, then, to consider why we should follow “the Christ. ” ​ — Matt.
16: 13 - 16.
What about those of us who are already walking in the footsteps of Jesus Christ?
We are exhorted to “keep on doing it more fully. ”
Whether we embraced true worship recently or decades ago, reflecting on reasons for following the Christ will help us to apply Paul’s exhortation and follow Him ever more fully in our daily lives.
Let us consider five reasons why we should want to follow the Christ.
To Increase Our Intimacy With Jehovah
In what two ways can we get to know Jehovah?
When addressing the Athenians as he “stood in the midst of the Areopagus, ” the apostle Paul said:“ [God] decreed the appointed times and the set limits of the dwelling of men, for them to seek God, if they might grope for him and really find him, although, in fact, he is not far off from each one of us. ”
We can seek God and really come to know him.
For example, the book of creation speaks volumes about God’s qualities and abilities.
Appreciatively reflecting on his creative works can teach us a great deal about the Creator.
Jehovah has also revealed details about himself in his written Word, the Bible.
The more we ‘ meditate on his activity ’ and ‘ concern ourselves with his dealings, ’ the better we can get to know Jehovah. ​ — Ps.
77: 12.
How can following the Christ help us to become intimately acquainted with Jehovah?
A very fine way to become even more intimately acquainted with Jehovah is to follow the Christ.
Just think of the glory Jesus had alongside his Father “before the world was ”!
He is “the beginning of the creation by God. ”
As “the firstborn of all creation, ” he lived for aeons in heaven with his Father, Jehovah.
During his prehuman existence, Jesus did more than just spend time with his Father.
He was God’s personal companion, happily working together with the Almighty, forming with him the strongest bond of love ever.
Jesus not only observed his Father’s way of doing things, taking note of His feelings and attributes, but also absorbed and adopted all of what he learned about his Father.
As a result, this obedient Son became just like his Father ​ — so much so that the Bible refers to him as “the image of the invisible God. ”
By closely following the Christ, we can become more intimately acquainted with Jehovah.
To Imitate Jehovah More Fully
What will help us to imitate Jehovah more fully, and why?
We are ‘ made in God’s image, according to his likeness, ’ so we have the capacity to reflect godly attributes.
The apostle Paul exhorted Christians to “become imitators of God, as beloved children. ”
Following the Christ helps us to imitate our heavenly Father.
When on earth, Jesus did not simply make Jehovah’s name known.
Rather, he revealed the Person that name represents.
(Read Matthew 11: 27.)
Jesus did this by his words and deeds, his teachings and example.
What do Jesus ’ teachings reveal about Jehovah?
By his teachings, Jesus showed what God requires of us and how he feels about his worshippers.
For example, after quoting one of the Ten Commandments ​ — “you must not commit adultery ” — ​ Jesus explained God’s view of what takes place inside the heart of a man long before he commits that act.
He said: “Everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. ”
After stating the Pharisaic interpretation of a statement in the Law ​ — “you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy ” — ​ Jesus made known Jehovah’s thinking, saying:“ Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you. ”
Gaining insight into how God thinks and feels and what he requires of us equips us to imitate him more fully.
7, 8.
What do we learn about Jehovah from Jesus ’ example?
Jesus also revealed what his Father is like by example.
When we read in the Gospels that Jesus felt compassion for the needy, empathy for those suffering, indignation at his disciples who reprimanded young children, do we not see the Father feeling the same emotions?
Think of how Jesus ’ actions shed light on God’s cardinal attributes.
Do not the miracles Christ performed show the tremendous power he had at his disposal?
Yet, he never used that power for personal gain or with the intent of harming others.
How clearly his action of throwing greedy merchants out of the temple shows his sense of justice!
His teachings and the winsome words he used to reach people’s hearts indicate that he was “more than Solomon ” in wisdom.
What can we say about the love Jesus displayed by surrendering his soul in behalf of others except that “no one has love greater than this ”? ​ — John 15: 13.
The Son of God represented Jehovah so perfectly in everything he said and did that he could say: “He that has seen me has seen the Father also. ”
(Read John 14: 9 - 11.)
Following the Christ is tantamount to imitating Jehovah.
Jesus Is the Anointed One of Jehovah
When and how did Jesus become God’s Anointed One?
Consider what took place in the autumn of 29 C.E. when 30 - year - old Jesus came to John the Baptizer.
“After being baptized Jesus immediately came up from the water; and, look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw descending like a dove God’s spirit coming upon him. ”
At that time, he became the Christ, or Messiah.
At that time, Jehovah himself made known that Jesus was his Anointed One, saying: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved. ”
What a fine reason that is for us to want to follow the Christ!
10, 11. (a) In what ways is the title “Christ ” used with reference to Jesus?
(b) Why should we not fail to follow Jesus Christ?
In the Bible, the title “Christ ” is used with reference to Jesus in various ways, such as Jesus Christ, Christ Jesus, and the Christ.
Jesus himself first used the term “Jesus Christ ” ​ — the name followed by the title.
In prayer to his Father, he said: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ. ” This usage clearly draws attention to the one who was sent forth by God and became his Anointed One.
When the title is placed ahead of the name, as in “Christ Jesus, ” the emphasis shifts from the person to the position, or office, held by him.
Using the expression “the Christ, ” the title preceded by the definite article, is another way to emphasize Jesus ’ office as the Messiah. ​ — Acts 5: 42.
Regardless of how the title “Christ ” is used with reference to Jesus, it highlights this important truth: Even though the Son of God came to the earth as a man and made his Father’s will known, he was neither just an ordinary man nor merely a prophet; he came to be the Anointed One of Jehovah.
We must not fail to follow this One.
Jesus Is the Only Way to Salvation
What statement made to the apostle Thomas holds meaning for us?
Another vital reason to keep on following the Messiah is stated in Jesus ’ words to his faithful apostles, spoken just a few hours before his death.
In response to Thomas ’ question about Jesus ’ statement concerning going away and preparing a place for them, Jesus said: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. ”
Jesus was then speaking to the 11 faithful apostles.
He promised them a place in heaven, but his words also have meaning for those who hope to gain everlasting life on earth.
How so?
In what sense is Jesus “the way ”?
Jesus Christ is “the way. ”
That is, he is the only one through whom it is possible for us to approach God.
This is true in the matter of prayer, for only by praying through Jesus do we have the assurance that the Father will give us whatever we may request in harmony with His will.
However, Jesus is “the way ” also in a further sense.
Sin has alienated mankind from God.
Jesus gave “his soul a ransom in exchange for many. ”
As a result, the Bible explains: “The blood of Jesus... cleanses us from all sin. ”
The Son has thus opened up the way of reconciliation with God.
It is by putting faith in Jesus and obeying him that we can have an approved relationship with God. ​ — John 3: 36.
How is Jesus “the truth ”?
Jesus is “the truth ” not only because he always spoke and lived the truth but also because all the prophecies written about the Messiah ​ — scores of them — ​ were fulfilled in him.
“No matter how many the promises of God are, ” wrote the apostle Paul,“ they have become Yes by means of him. ”
Even “a shadow of the good things to come ” contained in the Mosaic Law became a reality in Christ Jesus.
Jesus is the focal point on which all prophecies concentrate, and they shed light on his central role in the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose.
To benefit from the fulfillment of what God has purposed for us, we need to follow the Messiah.
In what sense is Jesus “the life ”?
Jesus is “the life ” because he has bought the human race with his lifeblood, and everlasting life is a gift that God gives“ by Christ Jesus our Lord. ”
Jesus is “the life ” also to those who have died.
Moreover, think of what he will do as High Priest during his Millennial Reign.
Why, he will obtain everlasting deliverance from sin and death for his earthly subjects! ​ — Heb. 9: 11, 12, 28.
What reason do we have for following Jesus?
Jesus ’ answer to Thomas, then, has great meaning for us.
Jesus is the way and the truth and the life.
He is the one God sent forth into the world for the world to be saved through him.
And no one comes to the Father except through him.
The Bible clearly states: “There is no salvation in anyone else, for there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved. ”
Whatever our background may be, therefore, it is the course of wisdom for us to believe in Jesus, follow him, and thus be led to life. ​ — John 20: 31.
We Are Commanded to Listen to the Christ
Why is it important for us to listen to God’s Son?
Peter, John, and James witnessed the transfiguration. At that time, they heard a voice from heaven say: “This is my Son, the one that has been chosen.
Listen to him. ” Our obeying the command to listen to the Messiah is a serious matter. ​ — Read Acts 3: 22, 23.
How may we listen to Jesus Christ?
Listening to Jesus involves ‘ looking intently at him, considering his example closely. ’
Hence, we do well to “pay more than the usual attention to the things ” we read about him in the Bible and in the publications of“ the faithful and discreet slave, ” as well as what we hear about him at Christian meetings.
As his sheep, let us be eager to listen to Jesus and follow him. ​ — John 10: 27.
What will help us to follow the Christ continually?
Can we succeed in following the Christ continually, no matter what comes our way?
Yes, we can, provided that we “keep holding the pattern of healthful words ” by practicing what we learn“ with the faith and love that are in connection with Christ Jesus. ” ​ — 2 Tim. 1: 13.

Jehovah declared: “This is my Son... listen to him ”
“A Time for Silence ”
“SPEECH is silver, silence is golden. ” So states an old proverb said to be of Oriental origin.
According to Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, its Hebrew equivalent is: “If a word be worth one shekel, silence is worth two. ”
And wise King Solomon of ancient Israel wrote: “For everything its season, and for every activity under heaven its time... a time for silence and a time for speech. ” ​ — Eccl.
3: 1, 7, The New English Bible.
When, though, is it appropriate to keep quiet rather than to speak?
The words “silent ” and“ silence ” appear over a hundred times in the pages of the Bible.
The context in which these words are used reveals the propriety of remaining silent in at least three areas of life.
Let us take a closer look at silence as a mark of respect, as evidence of discretion and discernment, and as an aid to meditation.
A Mark of Respect
Silence is a sign of respect or honor.
The prophet Habakkuk said: “Jehovah is in his holy temple.
Keep silence before him, all the earth! ”
True worshippers are to “wait, even silently, for the salvation of Jehovah. ”
The psalmist sang: “Keep silent before Jehovah and wait longingly for him.
Do not show yourself heated up at anyone making his way successful. ” ​ — Ps.
37: 7.
Can we praise Jehovah without using words?
Well, are we not at times so awestruck when viewing the beauty of creation that we are rendered speechless?
Is not thinking about such grandeur a way of praising the Creator in our heart?
The psalmist David began one of his melodies, saying: “For you there is praise ​ — silence —, O God, in Zion; and to you the vow will be paid. ” ​ — Ps.
65: 1.
As Jehovah himself merits our respect, so do his utterances.
For example, when God’s prophet Moses delivered his farewell address to the nation of Israel, he and the priests admonished all present, saying: “Keep silent..., and you must listen to the voice of Jehovah your God. ”
Attentive listening was required of even the Israelite children when the sons of Israel came together for the reading of God’s Law.
“Congregate the people, ” said Moses,“ the men and the women and the little ones... in order that they may learn. ” ​ — Deut.
27: 9, 10; 31: 11, 12.
How appropriate that Jehovah’s modern - day worshippers respectfully listen to the instructions they receive at Christian gatherings, including large conventions!
When vital Bible truths are being conveyed from the platform, would it not show disrespect for God’s Word and his organization if we unnecessarily conversed with one another?
During the sessions, it is time to keep silent and listen.
Even in private one - on - one conversations, being a good listener is a mark of respect.
For example, the patriarch Job said to his accusers: “Instruct me, and I, for my part, shall be silent. ”
Job was willing to listen silently when they spoke.
And when it was his turn to speak, he requested: “Keep silent before me, that I myself may speak. ” ​ — Job 6: 24; 13: 13.
Evidence of Discretion and Discernment
The Bible states: “The one keeping his lips in check is acting discreetly. ”
“The man of broad discernment is one that keeps silent. ”
Consider how beautifully Jesus manifested discretion and discernment by keeping silent.
Upon discerning that speaking in the hostile environment generated by his enemies would serve no useful purpose, “Jesus kept silent. ”
Later, when on trial before Pilate, Jesus “made no answer. ”
He discreetly chose to let his public record speak for itself. ​ — Matt. 27: 11 - 14.
We too are wise to keep our lips in check, particularly when we are provoked.
“He that is slow to anger is abundant in discernment, ” says a proverb,“ but one that is impatient is exalting foolishness. ”
A hasty oral response in a trying situation can result in rash speech that is later regretted. Under such circumstances, our words may appear foolish, and our peace of mind may suffer as a result.
It is the course of discretion to guard our lips when in the presence of wicked people.
When confronted by ridiculers in our ministry, silence may well be the proper response.
Moreover, would it not sometimes be wise to remain silent so as not to convey an impression of approval when our schoolmates or coworkers tell off - color jokes or use vulgar language?
“I will set a muzzle as a guard to my own mouth, ” wrote the psalmist,“ as long as anyone wicked is in front of me. ” ​ — Ps.
39: 1.
A person of “broad discernment ” does not betray a confidence.
A true Christian will not divulge confidential matters through unguarded speech.
Christian elders must be particularly circumspect in this regard so as to retain the trust of members of the congregation.
Although silence carries no words, it can have a positive effect.
Concerning one of his contemporaries, the 19th - century English writer Sydney Smith wrote: “He has occasional flashes of silence, that make his conversation perfectly delightful. ”
Indeed, everyday conversation between two friends should be two - way communication.
A good conversationalist must be a good listener.
“In the abundance of words there does not fail to be transgression, ” warned Solomon,“ but the one keeping his lips in check is acting discreetly. ”
Hence, the fewer the words spoken, the less the chance of committing an indiscretion.
In fact, “even anyone foolish, when keeping silent, will be regarded as wise; anyone closing up his own lips, as having understanding. ”
May we, then, prayerfully ask Jehovah to ‘ set a watch over the door of our lips. ’ ​ — Ps.
141: 3.
An Aid to Meditation
Concerning the man who follows the way of righteousness, the Scriptures inform us that “in [God’s] law he reads in an undertone day and night. ”
The Amplified Bible reads: “On His law... he habitually meditates... by day and by night. ”
What circumstance best lends itself to such meditation?
Isaac, the son of the patriarch Abraham, “was out walking in order to meditate in the field at about the falling of evening. ”
He chose a quiet time and place for meditation.
It was during the silence of the night watches that King David meditated.
The perfect man Jesus made a determined effort to satisfy his need for solitude and meditation, away from the clamor of crowds, in the seclusion of mountains, deserts, and other lonely places. ​ — Matt. 14: 23; Luke 4: 42; 5: 16.
The restorative effects of silence cannot be denied.
Silence can provide an environment for healthy self - examination ​ — an essential prerequisite for self - improvement.
Silence can promote peace of mind.
Meditation during quiet periods can engender modesty and humility within us and can enhance our appreciation for the truly important things in life.
While silence can be a virtue, there is also “a time to speak. ”
True worshippers today are busy preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom “in all the inhabited earth. ”
The resulting joyful noise is being heard with ever - increasing volume as their ranks grow.
By all means, let us be among those who are zealously declaring the Kingdom good news and speaking about the wonderful works of God.
As we share in this important activity, may our lifestyle also reflect an awareness that silence, at times, is golden.

Where Should You Be When the End Comes?
WHEN Jehovah brings an end to the present wicked system of things at Armageddon, how will upright individuals fare?
Proverbs 2: 21, 22 answers: “The upright are the ones that will reside in the earth, and the blameless are the ones that will be left over in it. As regards the wicked, they will be cut off from the very earth; and as for the treacherous, they will be torn away from it. ”
How, though, will the blameless be left over in the earth?
Will there be a place of refuge for them?
Where should the upright be when the end comes?
Four Scriptural accounts of survival shed light on these matters.
When Location Was Important
Concerning the deliverance of the patriarchs Noah and Lot, we read at 2 Peter 2: 5 - 7: “[God] did not hold back from punishing an ancient world, but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness, safe with seven others when he brought a deluge upon a world of ungodly people; and by reducing the cities Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them, setting a pattern for ungodly persons of things to come; and he delivered righteous Lot, who was greatly distressed by the indulgence of the law - defying people in loose conduct. ”
How did Noah survive the Flood?
God told Noah: “The end of all flesh has come before me, because the earth is full of violence as a result of them; and here I am bringing them to ruin together with the earth.
Make for yourself an ark out of wood of a resinous tree. ”
Noah constructed the ark just as Jehovah had commanded him.
Seven days before the floodwaters began to fall, Jehovah instructed him to gather the animals into the ark and go into it along with all his household.
On the seventh day, the door was shut behind him, “and the downpour upon the earth went on for forty days and forty nights. ”
Noah and his family “were carried safely through the water. ”
Their survival depended on their being inside the ark.
No other place on earth could offer security. ​ — Gen.
7: 19, 20.
In the case of Lot, the instructions were somewhat different.
Two angels informed him of where he was not to be. “All who are yours in the city [of Sodom], ” the two angels told Lot,“ bring out of the place!
For we are bringing this place to ruin. ”
They were to “escape to the mountainous region. ” ​ — Gen.
19: 12, 13, 17.
The experiences of Noah and Lot prove that “Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial, but to reserve unrighteous people for the day of judgment. ” In both of these cases of deliverance, location was a decisive factor.
Noah had to go into the ark; Lot had to get out of Sodom.
But is this always the case?
Can Jehovah save the righteous wherever they are, without their having to relocate?
To answer that question, note two other accounts of deliverance.
Is Location Always Important?
Before Jehovah devastated Egypt by bringing the tenth plague in Moses ’ day, He commanded the Israelites to splash the blood of the Passover animal on the lintels and doorposts of their houses. Why?
So that ‘ when Jehovah passed through to plague the Egyptians and saw the blood upon the upper part of the doorway and upon the two doorposts, he would pass over the entrance and not allow the ruination to enter into their houses to plague them. ’
That very night, “Jehovah struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the prison hole, and every firstborn of beast. ”
The firstborn of the Israelites were saved without anyone having to relocate. ​ — Ex.
12: 22, 23, 29.
Consider also the case of Rahab, a prostitute living in the city of Jericho.
The Israelites were about to begin their conquest of the Promised Land.
When Rahab realized that Jericho was doomed, she told the two Israelite spies that the city was paralyzed with fear of the advancing Israelites.
She hid the spies and asked them to swear to her that she and her whole family would be preserved when Jericho was conquered.
The spies instructed Rahab to congregate her family inside her house, situated on the city wall.
Leaving the house would mean destruction with the rest of the city.
However, Jehovah later told Joshua that “the wall of the city must fall down flat. ”
What the spies had stipulated as the place of safety now seemed to be in jeopardy.
How would Rahab and her household be delivered?
When the time came to capture Jericho, the Israelites shouted and proceeded to blow the horns.
“It came about that as soon as the people [of Israel] heard the sound of the horn and the people began to shout a great war cry, ” states Joshua 6: 20,“ then the wall began to fall down flat. ”
The collapsing wall was now beyond human control.
Miraculously, though, the crumbling of the city wall stopped at Rahab’s house.
Joshua ordered the two spies: “Go into the house of the woman, the prostitute, and bring out of there the woman and all who belong to her, just as you have sworn to her. ”
All in Rahab’s house were saved.
What Counted Most?
What can we learn from the deliverance of Noah, Lot, the Israelites in Moses ’ day, and Rahab?
How do these accounts help us to determine where we should be when the end of the present wicked system of things comes?
True, Noah found salvation in the ark.
But why was he there?
Was it not because he exercised faith and was obedient?
“Noah proceeded to do according to all that God had commanded him, ” says the Bible.
“He did just so. ”
What about us?
Are we doing all that God has commanded us?
Noah was also “a preacher of righteousness. ”
Like him, are we zealous in the preaching work, even if our territory is unresponsive?
Lot escaped destruction by fleeing Sodom.
He was spared because he was righteous in God’s eyes and was greatly distressed by the loose conduct of the law - defying people of Sodom and Gomorrah.
Does the loose conduct so prevalent today really distress us?
Or are we so desensitized that it does not bother us?
Are we doing our utmost to be found “spotless and unblemished and in peace ”? ​ — 2 Pet. 3: 14.
For the Israelites in Egypt and for Rahab in Jericho, deliverance depended on remaining in their houses.
This required faith and obedience.
Imagine how each Israelite family must have fixed their eyes on their firstborn as “there began arising a great outcry ” in one Egyptian household after another.
Imagine how Rahab must have huddled together with her family as she felt the rumbling of Jericho’s collapsing walls coming closer and closer.
It took real faith on her part to remain obedient and stay in that house.
Soon the end will come for Satan’s wicked world.
How Jehovah will protect his people in the fear - inspiring ‘ day of his anger, ’ we do not yet know.
Regardless of where we are and what our situation is at that time, however, we can be sure that our survival will depend on our faith in Jehovah and our obedience to him.
Meanwhile, we should cultivate a proper attitude toward what Isaiah’s prophecy refers to as our “interior rooms. ”
“Enter Into Your Interior Rooms ”
“Go, my people, enter into your interior rooms, and shut your doors behind you, ” states Isaiah 26: 20.“ Hide yourself for but a moment until the denunciation passes over. ”
This prophecy may have had its first fulfillment in 539 B.C.E. when the Medes and the Persians conquered Babylon.
Upon entering Babylon, Cyrus the Persian apparently commanded everyone to stay indoors because his soldiers were ordered to execute any found out - of - doors.
In our day, the “interior rooms ” of this prophecy could be closely associated with the more than 100,000 congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world.
Such congregations play an important role in our lives.
They will continue to do so through “the great tribulation. ”
God’s people are commanded to go into their “interior rooms ” and hide themselves“ until the denunciation passes over. ”
It is vital that we develop and maintain a wholesome attitude toward the congregation and be firmly resolved to stay in close association with it.
We can take to heart Paul’s exhortation: “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as [we] behold the day drawing near. ” ​ — Heb. 10: 24, 25.

What can we learn from God’s past acts of deliverance?

What may the “interior rooms ” point to in modern times?
Questions From Readers
When was Satan cast out of heaven? ​ — Rev.
12: 1 - 9.
Although the Bible book of Revelation does not give the precise time of Satan’s ousting, it does mention a series of events that can help us to estimate when he was cast out of heaven.
First among the events is the birth of the Messianic Kingdom.
Subsequent to that, “war broke out in heaven, ” which led to Satan’s defeat and his finally being cast out of heaven.
The Scriptures clearly mark 1914 as the year when “the appointed times of the nations ” ended and the Kingdom was established.
* How soon after that did the war in heaven break out, resulting in Satan’s ousting?
“The dragon [Satan] kept standing before the woman who was about to give birth, ” states Revelation 12: 4,“ that, when she did give birth, it might devour her child. ”
This shows that Satan wanted to dispose of the newborn Kingdom quickly, at the moment of its birth if at all possible.
Though Jehovah’s intervention prevented Satan from realizing his wicked intention, Satan was determined and relentless in his effort to do harm to the newly established Kingdom.
It stands to reason, therefore, that “Michael and his angels ” would waste no time in taking action to remove“ the dragon and its angels ” from the heavenly scene so that no harm could come to the Kingdom.
This suggests that the defeat and ousting of Satan took place soon after the Kingdom’s birth in 1914.
Another factor to consider is the resurrection of anointed Christians, which ​ — as Scriptural evidence indicates — ​ began soon after the establishment of the Kingdom.
* Since none of Christ’s anointed brothers are spoken of as accompanying Jesus in the battle with the dragon and its angels, the war in heaven and the ousting of Satan and his demons would have been completed by the time the resurrection of Christ’s brothers got under way.
So, then, the Bible does not reveal the exact time when Satan and his demons were expelled from heaven.
Nevertheless, it is evident that this event closely followed the enthronement of Jesus Christ in heaven in 1914.
See pages 215 - 218 of the book What Does the Bible Really Teach?
See The Watchtower, January 1, 2007, pages 27 - 28, paragraphs 9 - 13.
Husbands, Imitate Christ’s Love!
ON THE final night of his life on earth, Jesus told his faithful apostles: “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves. ”
Indeed, true Christians are to love one another.
Singling out husbands from among Christ’s followers, the apostle Paul wrote: “Husbands, continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation and delivered up himself for it. ”
How can a Christian husband apply this Scriptural admonition in his marriage, particularly when his wife is a dedicated servant of Jehovah?
Christ Cherished the Congregation
“Husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies, ” states the Bible.
“He who loves his wife loves himself, for no man ever hated his own flesh; but he feeds and cherishes it, as the Christ also does the congregation. ”
Jesus felt affection for his disciples and held them dear. He cherished them.
Even though they were imperfect, he was gentle and kind to them. Jesus focused on the good qualities of his disciples. ​ — Eph.
5: 27. Just as Christ expressed love for the congregation, a husband must show love for his mate in both word and deed.
A wife who is the recipient of regular expressions of her husband’s love feels cherished and happy.
On the other hand, a woman having all the comforts of a fine home can be desperately unhappy if she is being neglected or ignored by her marriage partner.
How does a husband show that he cherishes his wife?
In public, he introduces her to others in a dignified manner and openly praises her for her support.
If his wife has played a key role in success the family has experienced, he does not hesitate to make that known to others.
Privately, she senses his affection. A touch of the hand, a smile, a hug, and a compliment may be small things, but they make lasting impressions on the heart of a woman.
“Not Ashamed to Call Them ‘ Brothers ’ ”
Christ Jesus was “not ashamed to call [his anointed followers] ‘ brothers. ’ ”
If you are a Christian husband, remember that your wife is also your Christian sister.
Her dedication to Jehovah takes precedence over her marriage vow, regardless of whether she was baptized before or after marrying you.
When calling on your wife to make a comment, the brother presiding at a congregation meeting appropriately refers to her as “Sister. ”
She is your sister too, not only at the Kingdom Hall but also at home.
It is just as important to be kind and polite to her at home as it is to be that way at the Kingdom Hall.
If you have additional privileges of service in the congregation, you may at times find it difficult to balance congregation and family responsibilities.
Good cooperation among the elders and ministerial servants and effective delegating of responsibilities can help you to free up time for the sister who needs you the most ​ — your wife.
Remember, a number of brothers could undoubtedly perform the congregation tasks assigned to you, but you are the only brother united to your wife in wedlock.
Moreover, you are the head of your wife.
The Bible states: “The head of every man is the Christ; in turn the head of a woman is the man. ”
How should you exercise this headship?
In a loving way, not by repeatedly quoting the aforementioned verse and demanding respect.
The key to exercising headship properly is to imitate Jesus Christ in the way you treat your wife. ​ — 1 Pet.
2: 21. “You Are My Friends ”
Jesus called his disciples his friends.
He told them: “I no longer call you slaves, because a slave does not know what his master does. But I have called you friends, because all the things I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. ”
Jesus and his disciples had good communication.
They also did things together.
“Jesus and his disciples ” were invited to the marriage feast at Cana.
The Bible says that “Jesus had many times met there with his disciples. ” ​ — John 18: 2.
A wife certainly needs to feel that she is her husband’s closest companion.
Serve God together. Take delight in studying the Bible together.
Spend time together ​ — walking, talking, eating together.
Be more than a married couple; be dear friends.
He “Loved Them to the End ”
Jesus ‘ loved his disciples to the end. ’
Some husbands fail to imitate Christ in this respect.
They may even abandon ‘ the wife of their youth, ’ perhaps for someone younger. ​ — Mal.
2: 14, 15.
Others, such as Willi, imitate Christ.
Because of declining health, Willi’s wife needed constant care for many years.
How did Willi feel about this? He said: “I have always considered my wife a gift from God and have appreciated her as such.
I will never forget that promise. ”
Christian husbands, imitate Christ’s love.
Cherish your God - fearing wife ​ — your sister and friend.

‘ Continue loving your wife ’
Imitate the Loyalty of Ittai
“GREAT and wonderful are your works, Jehovah God, the Almighty.
Righteous and true are your ways, King of eternity.
Who will not really fear you, Jehovah, and glorify your name, because you alone are loyal? ”
This song, sung in heaven by “those who come off victorious from the wild beast and from its image, ” draws attention to God’s loyalty.
Jehovah wants his worshippers to imitate him in displaying this desirable quality. ​ — Eph. 4: 24.
Satan the Devil, on the other hand, does everything in his power to separate God’s earthly servants from the love of the God whom they worship.
Still, many have maintained loyalty to God even under very harsh conditions.
How grateful we can be that Jehovah highly esteems such devotion!
Indeed, we are assured: “Jehovah is a lover of justice, and he will not leave his loyal ones. ”
To help us remain loyal, he has included in his Word a record of the acts of many loyal ones.
One such account is that of Ittai the Gittite.
‘ A Foreigner and an Exile ’
Ittai was presumably a native of the renowned Philistine city of Gath, the home of the giant Goliath and other formidable foes of Israel.
Without introduction, the seasoned warrior Ittai steps into the Bible record at the time of Absalom’s rebellion against King David.
Ittai and 600 Philistine men who had followed him were then living in exile in the vicinity of Jerusalem.
The situation of Ittai and his followers may have caused David to recall his own days as an exiled fugitive when he and 600 Israelite warriors relocated to Philistine territory and entered the domain of Achish, the king of Gath.
What would Ittai and his men do as David faced his son Absalom’s revolt?
Would they side with Absalom, remain neutral, or throw in their lot with David and his men?
Picture the scene as David, fleeing Jerusalem, comes to a halt at a place called Beth - merhak, meaning “The Far House. ”
It is perhaps the last house in Jerusalem in the direction of the Mount of Olives before crossing the Kidron Valley.
Here David reviews his forces as they pass by.
With him are not only loyal Israelites but also all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites.
Moreover, there are all the Gittites ​ — Ittai and his 600 warriors. ​ — 2 Sam.
15: 18.
With heartfelt empathy, David says to Ittai: “Why should you yourself also go with us?
Go back and dwell with the king [evidently meaning Absalom]; for you are a foreigner and, besides, you are an exile from your place.
Yesterday was when you came and today shall I make you wander with us, to go when I am going wherever I am going?
Go back and take your brothers back with you, and may Jehovah exercise toward you loving - kindness and trustworthiness! ” ​ — 2 Sam.
15: 19, 20.
Ittai’s declaration of unflinching loyalty rings out.
He answers: “As Jehovah is living and as my lord the king is living, in the place where my lord the king may come to be, whether for death or for life, there is where your servant will come to be! ”
This may have reminded David of similar words spoken by his great - grandmother Ruth.
His heart touched by Ittai’s statement, David tells him: “Go and cross over ” the Kidron Valley.
At that, “Ittai the Gittite crossed over, and also all his men and all the little ones that were with him. ” ​ — 2 Sam.
15: 22.
“For Our Instruction ”
“All the things that were written aforetime were written for our instruction, ” states Romans 15: 4.
So we do well to ask, What lessons can we learn from Ittai’s example?
Consider what may have prompted him to be loyal to David.
Even though he was a foreigner and an exile from Philistia, Ittai recognized Jehovah as the living God and David as Jehovah’s anointed one.
Ittai was able to look beyond the animosity that existed between the Israelites and the Philistines.
He viewed David as more than someone who had killed the Philistine champion Goliath and many more of Ittai’s countrymen.
Ittai saw David as a man who loved Jehovah and no doubt took note of David’s remarkable qualities.
In turn, David came to have high regard for Ittai. Why, David even placed one third of his forces “under the hand of Ittai ” in the climactic battle against Absalom’s forces! ​ — 2 Sam.
18: 2.
We too should strive to look beyond cultural, racial, or ethnic differences ​ — any lingering prejudices and animosities — ​ and recognize the good qualities in others.
The bond that formed between David and Ittai illustrates that our coming to know and love Jehovah can help us to overcome such barriers.
As we reflect on Ittai’s example, we can ask ourselves: ‘ Do I display a similar loyal attachment to the Greater David, Christ Jesus?
Do I show my loyalty by having a zealous share in the work of Kingdom preaching and disciple making? ’
‘ How far am I willing to go to prove my loyalty? ’
Family heads also benefit by meditating on Ittai’s example of loyalty.
His allegiance to David and his decision to go with God’s anointed king affected Ittai’s men.
Likewise, the decisions that family heads make in support of true worship affect their families and may even bring temporary hardships.
Yet, we are assured: “With someone loyal [Jehovah] will act in loyalty. ” ​ — Ps.
18: 25.
Following David’s battle with Absalom, the Scriptures say nothing more about Ittai.
The glimpse of him in God’s Word nevertheless provides remarkable insight into his character during that difficult time in David’s life.
Ittai’s inclusion in the inspired record is proof that Jehovah recognizes and rewards such loyalty. ​ — Heb. 6: 10.
The Search for a Practical Guide
IF YOU are looking for advice, there is plenty available.
The self - help business is one of the world’s fastest - growing enterprises.
In places as diverse as Britain, Latin America, Japan, and the United States, books on self - improvement are best sellers.
Videos, seminars, and TV programs dealing with self - help are also gaining in popularity.
Their appeal lies in the notion that you can tackle your problems yourself, without having to consult a psychologist, a marriage counselor, or a minister.
What fields do these guides cover?
Personal fulfillment, satisfaction in love, and the raising of children are among the most popular themes.
Coping with depression, grief, and the effects of a divorce are other common subjects.
Also in big demand is advice on combating overeating, smoking, and heavy drinking.
Is the counsel practical?
Sometimes it is, but often it is not.
Thus, it is wise to consider the Bible’s caution: “Anyone inexperienced puts faith in every word, but the shrewd one considers his steps. ” ​ — Proverbs 14: 15.
Self - improvement guides are very different from instruction manuals that teach skills like photography, accounting, or language.
Such manuals can be effective and inexpensive alternatives to taking a special course.
Self - help books ​ — whether on business, marriage, parenting, or mental health — ​ are different.
They usually recommend a way of life or advocate certain philosophies. So it is wise to ask: ‘ Who is offering the advice?
What is the source of his information? ’
Experts may not always base their opinions on carefully collected evidence.
Some may provide the advice that sells best, knowing that there is a great deal of money to be made by telling people what they want to hear.
Why, in one country alone, the self - help industry brings in over eight billion dollars each year!
How Practical Are Self - Help Guides?
Sometimes, though, what you find is superficial or abstract in nature.
Whatever you want, be it money, health, or a satisfying relationship, you will have it if you think positively. ’ Is that sort of advice practical? Will it help you to face the realities and disappointments of life?
Do they help people to build happy, stable families?
According to one reviewer, the author of self - help books on love that were an instant success in Latin America “coaches readers on how to create healthy relationships and build self - esteem. ”
The author claims that staying in a relationship that doesn’t work is a type of betrayal of oneself.
The underlying message is that the important thing is to do what makes one feel good rather than recognize one’s problems and try to solve them.
Granted, self - help guides may contain some good advice.
Yet, they can also give harmful advice.
An expert may give helpful suggestions on one subject while his advice on a different subject may actually make things worse.
It would be impossible to sort through the many, and often contradictory, opinions offered by these guides.
Whose advice can you trust?
Ask yourself: ‘ Is the advice carefully researched, or is it the arbitrary opinion of the author?
To what extent has the pursuit of riches or prominence influenced the author’s integrity? ’
One guide that has stood the test of time is the Bible.
It offers practical advice on many of the subjects self - help guides deal with and more.
It has moved millions to act on the counsel: “Be made new in the force actuating your mind... Put on the new personality. ”
The Bible provides wise insight into what causes our problems and teaches us how to cope with them.
Most important, it provides powerful and practical motivation for doing what is right.
The next article will explain how this is so.
Why the Bible Is Practical for Our Day
“All scripture is inspired by God and can profitably be used... for guiding people’s lives. ” ​ — 2 TIMOTHY 3: 16, The Jerusalem Bible.
THROUGHOUT the centuries, the Bible has moved people of many cultures to change their way of life for the better.
The scripture quoted above explains why the Bible is effective in this way ​ — its wisdom comes from God.
Though written by men, the Bible communicates God’s thoughts to us.
The Bible explains: “Men spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit. ” ​ — 2 Peter 1: 21. The Bible is a practical guide in at least two ways.
First, it offers a realistic view of what constitutes a better way of life.
Second, it has the power to motivate people to make the necessary changes to attain that better way of life.
Let us consider these two aspects.
Insight Into Practical Goals
In the Bible, God made this promise: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go. I will give advice with my eye upon you. ”
Note that God offers not only advice but also insight, which is the ability to see into or below the surface of a situation.
Having insight to discern what goals are truly beneficial can protect us from wasting our life on worthless pursuits.
For example, many people make prominence or prosperity their goal in life.
Self - help books abound on how to outsmart others to gain prestige or to become rich.
The Bible, on the other hand, tells us: “The rivalry of one toward another... is vanity and a striving after the wind. ”
“A mere lover of silver will not be satisfied with silver. ”
Is that practical advice for us today?
To illustrate how practical the counsel from the Bible is, let us consider the case of Akinori, in Japan.
Overcoming fierce competition, Akinori achieved his goal of graduating from a leading university and landing a job with a prestigious firm.
Everything seemed to be going his way.
Yet, his success did not lead to the happiness he had hoped for. Instead, stress and fatigue ruined his health.
His friends at work were of little comfort to him.
Depressed, he became an alcoholic and even considered taking his own life.
Then he began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
What he learned changed his view of what is important in life.
Soon, his stress - induced ailments began to disappear.
Rather than being driven by pride and ambition, Akinori came to experience firsthand what the Bible proverb says: “A heart at peace gives life to the body. ” ​ — Proverbs 14: 30, The Holy Bible — ​ New International Version.
What do you consider to be the most practical goal in life?
What achievement would make you genuinely happy?
Would it be having a successful marriage?
Or giving your children a fine start in life?
Making many friends? Finding joy in living?
All of these are worthwhile goals.
In fact, the Bible encourages them, though not as our main purpose in life.
With practical insight, the Bible points to a fundamental requirement for a satisfying way of life when it says: “Fear the true God and keep his commandments.
For this is the whole obligation of man. ” When we neglect to carry out this obligation, life becomes aimless, frustrating, and ultimately disappointing.
On the other hand, the Bible assures us: “Happy is he that is trusting in Jehovah. ” ​ — Proverbs 16: 20.
How the Bible Moves People to Change
“The word of God is alive and exerts power, ” wrote the apostle Paul.
Like a sharp, two - edged sword, it can penetrate a person’s deepest thoughts and intentions.
The Bible has the power to change the way people live because it helps them to see themselves as they really are and not just as they think they are.
Those with the right heart condition, then, will come to realize that they may need to make changes.
For example, concerning those in the Christian congregation in ancient Corinth who had once been thieves, drunkards, adulterers, and the like, Paul said: “That is what some of you were.
But you have been washed clean... with the spirit of our God. ”
Jehovah’s holy spirit is just as active and powerful today, and it can move people to make the necessary changes.
Mario, who lives in Europe, was a violent man who smoked and sold marijuana.
On one occasion, when a policeman confiscated his drugs, he became so enraged that he assaulted the officer and destroyed his car.
In addition, Mario was unemployed and deep in debt.
Realizing that he could not solve his problems himself, he agreed to have a Bible study.
As he made progress, Mario cleaned up his appearance, quit using and selling drugs, and stopped resorting to violence.
Many who knew his former ways were astonished.
They stopped him and asked, “Mario, is it really you? ”
What motivates individuals like Akinori and Mario to turn their life around and find true satisfaction and joy in living?
Clearly, it is their newfound knowledge of God acquired through a study of the Bible.
Only God can provide the practical instruction that we need to make a success of life now and to have the prospect of everlasting life in the future.
Like a Father, Jehovah God speaks to us through the Bible: “Hear, my son, and accept my sayings.
When you walk, your pace will not be cramped; and if you run, you will not stumble.
Take hold on discipline; do not let go. Safeguard it, for it itself is your life. ”
What advice could be more practical than for us to seek the guidance of our Creator?

Practical Advice for Today
The Bible provides basic but practical principles that can guide us in every aspect of modern life.
Here are some examples:
• Enjoying good relationships with others
“All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must likewise do to them. ” ​ — Matthew 7: 12.
“He that conducts himself as a lesser one among all of you is the one that is great. ” ​ — Luke 9: 48.
“Follow the course of hospitality. ” ​ — Romans 12: 13.
• Overcoming destructive habits
“He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly. ” ​ — Proverbs 13: 20.
“Do not come to be among heavy drinkers of wine. ” ​ — Proverbs 23: 20.
“Do not have companionship with anyone given to anger. ” ​ — Proverbs 22: 24.
• Building a stable marriage
“Let each one of you individually so love his wife as he does himself; on the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband. ” ​ — Ephesians 5: 33.
“Clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion, kindness, lowliness of mind, mildness, and long - suffering.
Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely. ” ​ — Colossians 3: 12, 13.
• Helping children
“Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it. ” ​ — Proverbs 22: 6.
“You, fathers, do not be irritating your children, but go on bringing them up in the discipline and mental - regulating of Jehovah. ” ​ — Ephesians 6: 4.
• Avoiding quarrels
“An answer, when mild, turns away rage, but a word causing pain makes anger to come up. ” ​ — Proverbs 15: 1.
“In showing honor to one another take the lead. ” ​ — Romans 12: 10.
Even among friends, business disputes are often avoided by making written agreements.
Thus, God’s servant Jeremiah wrote: “I wrote in a deed and affixed the seal and took witnesses as I went weighing the money in the scales. ” ​ — Jeremiah 32: 10.
• Cultivating a positive attitude
“Whatever things are true,... lovable,... well spoken of, whatever virtue there is and whatever praiseworthy thing there is, continue considering these things. ” ​ — Philippians 4: 8.
The Bible discourages dwelling on negative thoughts and censures “complainers about their lot in life. ”
It says: “Rejoice in the hope. ” ​ — Jude 4, 16; Romans 12: 12.
Applying these fine principles will not only enable us to enjoy peace and contentment now but also help us to measure up to God’s requirements and receive his blessing.
The Bible says: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it. ” ​ — Psalm 37: 29.

Do All Religions Lead to the Same God?
“I have my own beliefs, and I am not going to change them.
Anyway, it does not matter which faith you belong to because all religions lead to the same God. ”
Many people hold the view that all religions offer equally valid ways of finding God and understanding the meaning of life.
Similarly widespread is the belief that there is good and bad in every religion and that no single faith has a monopoly on truth or can make the claim that it is the only way to God.
Such ideas are popular in today’s so - called tolerant or pluralistic society.
In fact, those who think otherwise are often viewed as narrow - minded, even bigoted.
What is your opinion?
Do you feel that all religions ultimately lead to the same God?
Does it matter which faith a person belongs to?
Are There Real Differences?
According to one encyclopedia, there are currently 9,900 religions worldwide, some of which span the globe and have millions of members.
Estimates suggest that some 70 percent of mankind belong to the five major religions ​ — Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism.
If all religions lead to the same God, these five faiths surely ought to have many things in common in their teachings, their portrayal of God, and their explanation of God’s purpose.
What do the facts show?
Roman Catholic theologian Hans Küng says that the major religions do indeed share some basic tenets within the realm of human relations.
Most, for instance, are in favor of not to murder, not to lie, not to steal, not to commit incest, and they teach respect for parents as well as love for children.
In other matters, however, and especially in their portrayal of God, these major religions differ drastically.
For example, Hindus worship a multitude of deities, whereas Buddhists are said to be unsure about a personal God.
Islam teaches that there is one God.
So do the churches that claim to be Christian, but most of them also claim that God is a Trinity.
Even among the churches, there is a wide range of dogma.
Mary, the mother of Jesus, is the object of devotion for Catholics but not for Protestants.
Birth control is generally prohibited for Catholics but not for most Protestants.
And Protestants cannot agree among themselves on the subject of homosexuality.
Is it logical to think that religions that embrace such a wide range of beliefs can all be worshipping the same God?
On the contrary, the result can be only confusion as to who God is and what he expects of those who worship him.
Do They Unite or Divide?
If all faiths lead to the same God, surely we would see each one of them exerting its influence to unite mankind in peace. Do the facts confirm that they do this?
History indicates that religion instead of unifying mankind is a source of division and strife.
Let us consider a few examples.
From the 11th to the 13th century, Christendom, that is, nations professing to be Christian, went to war with Islamic powers in a series of Crusades.
In 17th - century Europe, Catholics and Protestants locked horns in the Thirty Years ’ War.
In 1947, as soon as independence from Great Britain was declared on the Indian subcontinent, Hindus and Muslims were at one another’s throat.
More recently Catholics and Protestants spent years in conflict in Northern Ireland.
In the Middle East, Jews and Muslims still find no peace with one another.
And at the top of the list must be put World War II, which engulfed members of all five major religions, even involving members of the same faith on opposite sides of the conflict.
The conclusion is inevitable. The world’s religions have not brought peace and unity, nor have they led to the same God.
On the contrary, they have divided mankind and painted a confusing picture of who God is and how to worship him.
Hence, anyone wanting to come to the true God must carefully choose the path he takes.
This is in harmony with what is encouraged by the Bible, one of the oldest religious books known to mankind.
Choose for Yourselves Whom You Will Serve
The Bible clearly shows that finding the way that leads to the true God requires careful thought and deliberate choice.
Joshua, a servant of Jehovah God, said to the ancient nation of Israel: “Choose for yourselves today whom you will serve, whether the gods that your forefathers who were on the other side of the River served or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling.
But as for me and my household, we shall serve Jehovah. ”
Years later, the prophet Elijah urged the people to make a similar choice: “How long will you be limping upon two different opinions?
If Jehovah is the true God, go following him; but if Baal [a Canaanite god] is, go following him. ” ​ — Joshua 24: 15, 16; 1 Kings 18: 21.
These and other Bible texts emphatically show that those who wanted to serve the true God had to make a conscientious choice.
The situation is the same today. If we want to worship and serve the true God, we too must make the right choice.
But what can help us make that choice in matters of worship?
How can we identify the true worshippers?
True Worshippers Recognized by Their Fruits
Regarding true and false worshippers, Jesus Christ told his followers: “Never do people gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles, do they?
Likewise every good tree produces fine fruit, but every rotten tree produces worthless fruit; a good tree cannot bear worthless fruit, neither can a rotten tree produce fine fruit....
Really, then, by their fruits you will recognize those men. ”
Accordingly, true worshippers would be recognized by their fruits, or works.
What are these fruits? ​ — Matthew 7: 16 - 20.
First, true worship unites believers in love.
Jesus explained to his disciples: “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves. ”
True followers of Christ must display love for one another that is so outstanding as to characterize them as true worshippers in the eyes of observers. ​ — John 13: 34, 35.
For this reason it would be unthinkable for true Christians to take up arms against one another in war.
Do church members keep to this standard?
In World War II, the only major religious group that consistently and steadfastly refused to support the war effort in any way were Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Dr. Hanns Lilje, former bishop of the Protestant Church in Hannover, Germany, wrote about the Witnesses: “They can rightfully claim to be the only major conscientious objectors in the Third Reich. ”
During that conflict, Witnesses in many lands chose to suffer reprisals rather than to promote or support the war.
What other fruits did Jesus have in mind that would identify genuine disciples?
In what is commonly known as the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus started by saying: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.
Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth. ”
Jesus assigned priority to the sanctification of God’s personal name, Jehovah.
He expressed the wish that through God’s Kingdom, Jehovah’s will should be done on earth.
Jehovah’s Witnesses publish the good news of the Kingdom in 236 countries and territories, disseminating literature in over 470 languages. ​ — Matthew 6: 9, 10.
Moreover, Jehovah’s Witnesses follow Jesus ’ example in staying clear of political and social controversies.
“They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world, ” Jesus said of his disciples.
In addition, the Witnesses accept the Bible as God’s Word and are convinced that “all Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work. ” ​ — John 17: 14, 17; 2 Timothy 3: 16, 17. True Religion Is Set Apart
These fruits ​ — self - sacrificing love, the desire to sanctify Jehovah’s name, the proclamation of God’s Kingdom, separateness from the world, and faith in the Bible — ​ all characterize true worshippers.
Such fruits also set genuine worshippers apart from other religions.
One lady who had enjoyed several conversations with Jehovah’s Witnesses drew her own conclusions and said: “I know many religions, and they are all similar to one another.
You are the only ones who are completely different from the others. ”
Clearly, all religions do not lead to the same God.
But there is one group that stands apart from all others ​ — Jehovah’s Witnesses, now numbering over seven million around the world.
By advocating and adhering to God’s Word, the Bible, they have done what no other group or organization has been able to do, namely, unite people of diverse nationalities, languages, ethnic backgrounds, and races in worship of the one true God, Jehovah.
They will be happy to help you learn about the true God, find out what he requires of you, and enjoy the peace and security that come from worshipping God in the way that he approves.
Is that not a worthwhile goal?

Does God Change His Mind?
REGARDING God, the Bible says: “With him there is not a variation of the turning of the shadow. ”
And reassuringly, God himself said: “I am Jehovah; I have not changed. ”
How Jehovah God differs from those who are hard to please and cannot be trusted because they constantly change their mind!
Some Bible readers wonder, however, if God has changed his mind.
For example, at one time Jehovah God gave Christians the power to perform miracles, but now he does not.
In ancient times, God tolerated polygamy, but he no longer does.
Under the Mosaic Law, Jehovah required Sabbath - keeping, but now he does not.
Do these instances not show that God has changed?
First of all, we can be sure that God never changes his standards of love and justice.
Also, his “eternal purpose ” to bless mankind by means of his Kingdom has never changed.
Nonetheless, just as you might change your mind about a person whose behavior consistently disappoints you, Jehovah does change in response to changing circumstances.
God also changes his instructions to his people according to their situation and needs. This should not surprise us.
Consider what a competent tour guide would do when he sees danger ahead.
He would tell his group to take a different road, away from the danger.
That, however, does not mean that he has changed his mind about the destination, does it?
Let us, therefore, examine the aforementioned three examples, which some find puzzling.
Why Did Miracles Cease?
Why did God give miraculous powers to some of the first - century Christians?
You may be aware that when Israel was God’s chosen nation, God often demonstrated by miracles that he was with them.
Through Moses, God exercised his awesome power in delivering Israel from Egypt and guiding them through the wilderness into the Promised Land.
Regrettably, time and again the Israelites did not respond with faith.
When Jehovah finally rejected Israel and established the Christian congregation, he gave miraculous powers to the apostles and others.
For example, the apostles Peter and John cured a man lame from birth, and Paul restored a dead man to life.
Miracles they performed helped to establish Christianity in many lands.
Why, then, did miracles cease?
The apostle Paul explained by means of an illustration: “When I was a babe, I used to speak as a babe, to think as a babe, to reason as a babe; but now that I have become a man, I have done away with the traits of a babe. ”
Just as parents treat a small child differently from an adult son, so Jehovah’s way of dealing with the Christian congregation changed when it was no longer “a babe. ”
The apostle Paul explained that such miraculous gifts as the ability to speak in foreign languages or to prophesy would “be done away with. ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 13: 8.
Why Was Polygamy Allowed?
Jesus showed that God set the standard for marriage when He told the first human pair: “A man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh. ”
Marriage was to be a lasting bond between two persons.
However, by the time God organized the Israelites into a nation and gave them the Law, polygamy had become a common practice.
Thus, though God did not originate or encourage polygamy, he provided laws to regulate it.
When the Christian congregation was formed, God’s Word clearly prohibited polygamy. ​ — 1 Timothy 3: 2.
Jehovah God tolerates certain things until his time to correct them.
Jesus showed that Jehovah had temporarily tolerated improper marriage customs as a “concession ” made out of regard for Israel’s“ hardheartedness. ” ​ — Matthew 19: 8; Proverbs 4: 18.
Why Was Sabbath - Keeping Temporary?
God instituted the observance of a weekly Sabbath after he delivered the Israelites from Egypt. He later made it part of their national Law.
The apostle Paul explained that Jesus offered himself as a sacrifice and “abolished... the Law of commandments consisting in decrees ” and“ blotted out the handwritten document. ”
What was “abolished ” and“ blotted out ” included the Sabbath law, for the Bible goes on to say: “Therefore let no man judge you in eating and drinking or in respect of a festival or of an observance of the new moon or of a sabbath. ”
Why did God give the Law, including the Sabbath, in the first place?
The apostle Paul wrote: “The Law has become our tutor leading to Christ. ”
Then he added: “Now that the faith has arrived, we are no longer under a tutor. ”
Although the Sabbath law was temporary, it pointed forward to the time when mankind would find lasting rest from physical and spiritual afflictions. ​ — Hebrews 4: 10; Revelation 21: 1 - 4.
A Trustworthy and Loving God
The Biblical examples considered above show that Jehovah God did give different directions and instructions at different times.
But that does not mean that he changed his mind.
Rather, he responded to the needs of his people under varying circumstances, and he did so for their benefit.
The same is true today. Because Jehovah does not change his standards, we can always know what we must do to please him.
Furthermore, we can be certain that everything God has promised will come true.
Jehovah says: “Everything that is my delight I shall do...
I have formed it, I shall also do it. ” ​ — Isaiah 46: 10, 11.

Be Zealous for Jehovah’s House!
“The zeal for your house will eat me up. ” ​ — JOHN 2: 17.
1, 2.
At the temple in 30 C.E., what did Jesus do, and why?
PICTURE the scene. It is Passover time, 30 C.E. Six months earlier, Jesus began his earthly ministry. Now he makes his way up to Jerusalem.
There at the temple in the Court of the Gentiles, Jesus discovers “those selling cattle and sheep and doves and the money brokers in their seats. ”
Brandishing a whip made of ropes, he drives out all the animals, and the merchants certainly follow them.
Jesus also pours out the coins of the money changers and overturns their tables.
He orders those selling doves to take what they have and leave. ​ — John 2: 13 - 16.
Jesus ’ actions relate directly to his concern for the temple.
“Stop making the house of my Father a house of merchandise! ”
As Jesus ’ disciples observe these events, they recall the words penned centuries earlier by the psalmist David: “The zeal for your house will eat me up. ” ​ — John 2: 16, 17; Ps. 69: 9.
(a) What is zeal?
(b) What question can we ask ourselves?
It was Jesus ’ concern, his zeal, for God’s house that moved him to act.
Zeal is “eagerness and ardent interest in pursuit of something. ”
In this 21st century, over seven million Christians manifest concern for God’s house. Individually, we may ask, ‘ How can I increase my personal zeal for Jehovah’s house? ’
To help us answer that, let us first examine what God’s house is today. Then we will consider Bible examples of faithful men who manifested zeal for it.
Their examples were written “for our instruction ” and can spur us on to even greater zeal. ​ — Rom.
15: 4. God’s House ​ — Then and Now
The temple that Solomon built served what purpose?
In ancient Israel, the house of God was the temple in Jerusalem.
Of course, Jehovah did not literally live there.
He declared: “The heavens are my throne, and the earth is my footstool.
Where, then, is the house that you people can build for me, and where, then, is the place as a resting - place for me? ”
Nevertheless, the temple built during Solomon’s reign served as the focal point for the worship of Jehovah, where prayers were offered. ​ — 1 Ki.
8: 27 - 30.
What is the modern - day arrangement foreshadowed by worship at Solomon’s temple?
Today, Jehovah’s house is no stone edifice in Jerusalem or anywhere else.
Rather, it is the arrangement for us to approach him in worship on the basis of Christ’s ransom sacrifice.
All of God’s faithful servants on earth unite to worship Jehovah in this spiritual temple. ​ — Isa.
60: 4, 8, 13; Acts 17: 24; Heb.
8: 5; 9: 24.
Which Judean kings demonstrated outstanding zeal for true worship?
After the division of Israel back in 997 B.C.E., 4 out of the 19 kings who ruled Judah, the southern part, demonstrated outstanding zeal for true worship.
They were Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah.
What important lessons can we learn from their examples?
Wholehearted Service Brings Blessings
7, 8. (a) What kind of service does Jehovah bless?
(b) What warning lesson can we learn from the example of King Asa?
During the reign of King Asa, Jehovah raised up prophets to guide His nation on a faithful course.
For example, the Bible tells us that Asa listened to the prophet Azariah, the son of Oded. (Read 2 Chronicles 15: 1 - 8.)
Asa’s reforms united the people of Judah as well as a great number of people from the kingdom of Israel who came down to join in a grand assembly at Jerusalem.
Together they declared their determination to worship Jehovah loyally.
We read: “They swore to Jehovah with a loud voice and with joyful shouting and with the trumpets and with horns.
And all Judah gave way to rejoicing over the thing sworn; for it was with all their heart that they had sworn and with full pleasure on their part that they had looked for him, so that he let himself be found by them; and Jehovah continued to give them rest all around. ”
Jehovah will likewise surely bless us when we serve him wholeheartedly. ​ — Mark 12: 30.
Sadly, Asa later resented correction from Hanani the seer.
How do we react when Jehovah offers us advice or direction through Christian elders?
Do we promptly take to heart their Scripturally based counsel and avoid falling into the trap of resentment?
What threat did Jehoshaphat and Judah face, and how did they react?
Jehoshaphat ruled as king in Judah during the tenth century B.C.E.
He and all Judah faced the threat of the combined forces of Ammon, Moab, and the people of the mountainous region of Seir.
Although he was afraid, what did the king do?
He and his men, together with their wives and children, gathered at Jehovah’s house to pray. (Read 2 Chronicles 20: 3 - 6.)
In line with Solomon’s words uttered earlier at the dedication of the temple, Jehoshaphat movingly beseeched Jehovah: “O our God, will you not execute judgment upon them?
For in us there is no power before this large crowd that is coming against us; and we ourselves do not know what we ought to do, but our eyes are toward you. ”
After Jehoshaphat prayed, there “in the middle of the congregation, ” Jehovah’s spirit moved Jahaziel, a Levite, to utter words of comfort that instilled confidence in the people. ​ — Read 2 Chronicles 20: 14 - 17.
(a) How did Jehoshaphat and Judah receive direction?
(b) How can we demonstrate appreciation for the direction Jehovah gives us today?
Yes, back then, Jehoshaphat and the kingdom of Judah received direction from Jehovah through Jahaziel.
Today, we receive comfort and direction through the faithful and discreet slave class.
Certainly, we always want to cooperate with and show respect for the appointed elders, who work hard in shepherding us and implementing the directions of “the faithful and discreet slave. ” ​ — Matt. 24: 45; 1 Thess. 5: 12, 13.
11, 12.
What lesson can we learn from what happened to Jehoshaphat and Judah?
Just as Jehoshaphat and his people gathered together to seek Jehovah’s guidance, let us not neglect regular attendance at congregation meetings along with our brothers and sisters.
If we sometimes find ourselves in sore straits, not knowing what to do, let us follow the fine example set by Jehoshaphat and the people of Judah and turn to Jehovah in prayer with full trust in Him.
5: 9.
Jehoshaphat and his people followed Jahaziel’s God - given direction.
With what result?
They came off victorious in the ensuing battle and returned to Jerusalem “with rejoicing ” and“ with stringed instruments and with harps and with trumpets to the house of Jehovah. ”
We likewise respect Jehovah’s direction given through his channel and join in praising him.
Take Good Care of Our Meeting Places
What work did Hezekiah initiate at the beginning of his reign?
In the first month of his reign, Hezekiah expressed his zeal for the worship of Jehovah by reopening and repairing the temple. He organized the priests and the Levites to cleanse God’s house.
They did so in 16 days. (Read 2 Chronicles 29: 16 - 18.)
That effort reminds us of the maintenance and repair work that keeps our meeting places in a condition that reflects our zealous worship of Jehovah.
Have you not heard experiences showing that people are impressed by the zeal of the brothers and sisters who share in such work?
Yes, their efforts bring much praise to Jehovah.
14, 15.
What work today has brought much praise to Jehovah?
Give examples.
In a city in the north of England, a man was opposed to the refurbishing work proposed for the Kingdom Hall adjacent to his property.
The local brothers responded kindly.
Observing that the boundary wall between the Kingdom Hall and the neighbor’s property needed repair, they offered to do the work at no cost.
They worked hard and, in fact, rebuilt most of the wall.
They handled the situation so well that the neighbor had a change of heart. He now helpfully keeps an eye on the Kingdom Hall property.
Jehovah’s people share in a worldwide building work.
Willing local volunteers join with full - time international servants to construct not only Kingdom Halls but also Assembly Halls and Bethel homes.
Sam is an engineer skilled in heating, ventilation, and air - conditioning.
He and his wife, Ruth, have traveled to several countries in Europe and Africa to help on construction projects.
Wherever they go, they also enjoy preaching along with the local congregations.
Sam explains what prompted him to participate in such international projects: “It was the encouragement of others who have served in Bethel homes here and abroad.
Just seeing their zeal and joy really moved me to want to serve this way. ”
Obey Divine Instructions
16, 17.
In what special activity have God’s people eagerly shared, and with what result?
In addition to temple repair, Hezekiah restored the yearly Passover celebration that Jehovah had commanded. (Read 2 Chronicles 30: 1, 4, 5.)
Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem invited the whole nation ​ — even those of the northern kingdom — ​ to attend.
Runners sped through the land carrying letters of invitation. ​ — 2 Chron.
30: 6 - 9.
In recent years, we have shared in a somewhat similar effort.
We have used appealing printed invitations to invite people in our territories to gather with us in commemorating the Lord’s Evening Meal, in obedience to Jesus ’ command.
Receiving instructions at our Service Meetings, we have zealously shared in this work.
And how Jehovah has blessed this effort!
Why, last year, some seven million of us distributed invitations, and a total of 17,790,631 people attended!
Why is zeal for true worship so important for you?
It was said of Hezekiah: “In Jehovah the God of Israel he trusted; and after him there proved to be no one like him among all the kings of Judah, even those who had happened to be prior to him.
And he kept sticking to Jehovah.
He did not turn aside from following him, but he continued keeping his commandments that Jehovah had commanded Moses. ”
May it be similar in our case.
Our zeal for God’s house will help us ‘ keep sticking to Jehovah ’ with the prospect of everlasting life in view. ​ — Deut.
30: 16.
Respond Promptly to Direction
What zealous effort is put forth at Memorial time?
When Josiah ruled as king, he too arranged for the Passover to be celebrated, making extensive preparations for it.
We also exercise special care to prepare well for district conventions, circuit assemblies, special assembly days, as well as for the Memorial.
Brothers in some countries even risk their lives to gather together in order to commemorate Christ’s death.
Zealous elders make sure that none in the congregation are overlooked. The elderly and the infirm receive help to be present for the occasion.
(a) What happened during King Josiah’s reign, and how did he react?
(b) What lesson do we want to take to heart?
During the restoration work that King Josiah organized, High Priest Hilkiah “found the book of Jehovah’s law by the hand of Moses. ”
He handed it to the royal secretary Shaphan who, in turn, began to read its contents to Josiah.
(Read 2 Chronicles 34: 14 - 18.)
What was the effect?
The king immediately ripped his garments apart in grief and instructed the men to consult Jehovah.
Through the prophetess Huldah, God provided a message condemning some of the religious practices that had been carried on in Judah.
Yet, Josiah’s good efforts to remove idolatrous practices were noted, and he remained in Jehovah’s favor despite the calamities predicted for the nation as a whole.
What can we learn from this?
Surely our desire is the same as Josiah’s was.
We want to respond to Jehovah’s direction promptly, taking to heart the warning example of what can happen if we allow apostasy and unfaithfulness to encroach on our worship.
And we can be confident that Jehovah will note with approval our zeal for true worship, just as he did in Josiah’s case.
21, 22. (a) Why should we demonstrate zeal for Jehovah’s house?
(b) What will we consider in the next article?
Those four kings of Judah ​ — Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah — ​ set fine examples for us in being zealous for God’s house and worship.
Our zeal should similarly move us to trust in Jehovah and to exert ourselves in behalf of his worship.
It is certainly the course of wisdom and the way to happiness to obey divine instructions and respond to the loving care and correction we receive through the congregation and its elders.
The next article will focus our attention on zeal for the field ministry and will provide encouragement for youths to serve our loving Father zealously.
We will also consider how we can avoid one of Satan’s most corrupting influences.
As we zealously heed all such reminders from Jehovah, we will be following the example of Jehovah’s own Son, Jesus, of whom it was said: “Sheer zeal for your house has eaten me up. ” ​ — Ps.
69: 9; 119: 111, 129; 1 Pet.
2: 21.
• What kind of service does Jehovah bless, and why?
• How can we demonstrate trust in Jehovah?
• How can zeal move us to obey divine instructions?

How did Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah show zeal for Jehovah’s house?
Be “Zealous for Fine Works ”!
“[Jesus] gave himself for us that he might deliver us from every sort of lawlessness and cleanse for himself a people peculiarly his own, zealous for fine works. ” ​ — TITUS 2: 14.
What happens in the temple area when Jesus arrives on Nisan 10, 33 C.E.?
IT IS Nisan 10, 33 C.E., just days before the Passover celebration.
Throngs of worshippers in the temple area in Jerusalem are excited.
What will happen when Jesus arrives?
Three Gospel writers ​ — Matthew, Mark, and Luke — ​ all testify that for a second time, Jesus throws out those selling and buying there.
He overturns the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
Jesus ’ zeal has not lessened since he took similar action three years earlier. ​ — John 2: 13 - 17.
2, 3.
How do we know that Jesus ’ zeal was not limited to the cleansing of the temple?
Matthew’s account indicates that Jesus ’ zeal on that occasion was not limited to cleansing the temple.
He was also curing the blind and lame who approached him there.
Luke’s record refers to other works that Jesus accomplished.
Jesus ’ zeal was thus significantly evident in his public ministry.
Later, the apostle Paul wrote to Titus and explained that Jesus “gave himself for us that he might deliver us from every sort of lawlessness and cleanse for himself a people peculiarly his own, zealous for fine works. ”
In what ways can we today be “zealous for fine works ”?
And how can the examples of the good kings of Judah encourage us?
Zeal for Preaching and Teaching
4, 5.
In what ways did four Judean kings prove to be zealous for fine works?
Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah all undertook campaigns in Judah to root out idolatry.
Asa “removed the foreign altars and the high places and broke up the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred poles. ”
Jehoshaphat, fired by his zeal for the worship of Jehovah, “removed the high places and the sacred poles from Judah. ” ​ — 2 Chron.
17: 6; 19: 3.
Following the solemn seven - day Passover celebration that Hezekiah organized in Jerusalem, “all the Israelites that were found there went out to the cities of Judah, and they proceeded to break up the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred poles and pull down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin and in Ephraim and Manasseh until they had finished. ”
Young Josiah became king when he was only eight years of age.
The historical record says: “In the eighth year of his reigning, while he was still a boy, he started to search for the God of David his forefather; and in the twelfth year he started to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem from the high places and the sacred poles and the graven images and the molten statues. ”
Hence, all four of those kings were zealous for fine works.
Why can our ministry be compared with the campaigns of faithful kings of Judah?
Today, we similarly engage in a campaign to help people break free from false religious teachings, including the practice of idolatry.
Our house - to - house ministry enables us to meet all sorts of people.
One young Asian girl remembers how her mother performed rituals in front of numerous images in their home.
Reasoning that not all the images could represent the true God, the girl often prayed that she could get to know his real identity.
When she answered a knock on the door of her house, she found two Witnesses who were ready to help her learn the true God’s distinctive name, Jehovah.
And how grateful she was to learn the truth about idols!
Now she demonstrates commendable zeal by sharing diligently in field service, helping other people spiritually. ​ — Ps.
83: 18; 115: 4 - 8; 1 John 5: 21.
What can we do to imitate the teachers who went through the land in Jehoshaphat’s day?
When we engage in the house - to - house ministry, how thoroughly do we cover our assigned territory?
Interestingly, in the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent for five princes, nine Levites, and two priests. He had them travel through all the cities to teach the people Jehovah’s laws. So effective was their campaign that the people of the surrounding nations began to fear Jehovah.
(Read 2 Chronicles 17: 9, 10.)
By visiting homes at various times on different days, we may be able to speak with several members of a household.
How might we widen the scope of our witnessing?
Many of God’s servants in modern times have been willing to leave their homes and move to serve where there is a greater need for zealous Witnesses.
Can you do so?
Some of us who cannot move away may try to witness to people who live in our area but speak a different language.
Because of the variety of nationalities he meets in his territory, at 81 years of age, Ron learned greetings in 32 languages!
He recently met an African couple in the street and greeted them in their native tongue, Yoruba.
They asked Ron if he had ever been to Africa.
When he replied no, they asked how he knew their language.
They readily accepted some magazines and freely gave him their address, which he passed on to the local congregation so that the couple could enjoy a Bible study.
Why is reading from the Bible in our ministry important?
Give an example.
The teachers who went through the land at Jehoshaphat’s command had “the book of Jehovah’s law ” with them.
Worldwide we endeavor to teach people from the Bible, since it is the Word of God.
We make a special effort to show others the actual words of the Bible, featuring it in our ministry.
One householder explained to Linda, a Witness, that her husband had suffered a stroke and needed her attention.
The householder lamented: “I don’t know what I have done that God allowed this to happen to me. ”
Linda responded: “May I assure you of something? ” She then read the words of James 1: 13 and added:“ All the suffering that we and our loved ones experience is not punishment from God. ”
At that, the householder gave Linda a warm hug.
Linda acknowledges: “I was able to give comfort by using the Bible.
Sometimes the verses we read from the Bible are ones the householder has never heard before. ”
That conversation led to a regular home Bible study with the woman.
Youths Who Serve Zealously
How was Josiah a good example for Christian youths today?
Returning to the example of Josiah, we note that he pursued true worship as a youth and was about 20 years of age when he embarked on his extensive campaign against idolatry. (Read 2 Chronicles 34: 1 - 3.)
Countless young people today demonstrate similar zeal in their Kingdom service.
11 - 13.
What lessons can we learn from modern - day youths who serve Jehovah with zeal?
Hannah, who lives in England, was 13 years old and studying the French language at school when she heard that a French - speaking group had been formed in a nearby town.
Her father agreed to accompany her to attend the meetings there.
Now 18, Hannah zealously witnesses in French as a regular pioneer.
Could you too learn a foreign language and help other people learn about Jehovah?
Commenting on her thinking when she began serving Jehovah back in 1995, she says: “I thought I had made the truth my own. ”
Then she adds: “After watching that drama, I now realize that I have simply cruised along for many years.
I have to fight for the truth and put real thought and effort into my service and personal study. ”
Now Rachel finds that she is serving Jehovah with more zeal.
What has she experienced as a result?
“My relationship with Jehovah has deepened.
My prayers are more meaningful, my study deeper and more satisfying, and Bible accounts more real to me.
As a result, I am enjoying the ministry so much and find real satisfaction as I see Jehovah’s words comforting others. ”
Luke is a youth who was encouraged by another dramatization, Young People Ask ​ — What Will I Do With My Life?
After watching this presentation, Luke writes: “I feel moved to reassess my situation in life. ”
He admits: “In the past, I was pressured to pursue financial security through higher education first and after that to focus on spiritual goals.
Such pressure is not conducive to spiritual progress; rather it tears one down. ”
Young brothers and sisters, why not see whether you can use what you learned in school to expand your ministry as Hannah did?
And why not take a leaf out of Rachel’s book, so to speak, by zealously pursuing goals that truly honor God?
Follow Luke’s example, avoiding the dangers that have proved to be a snare to many youths.
Zealously Heed Warnings
What kind of worship does Jehovah accept, and why is maintaining this such a challenge today?
Jehovah’s people need to be clean if their worship is to be acceptable to him.
Isaiah warns: “Turn away, turn away, get out of there, touch nothing unclean; get out from the midst of her [Babylon], keep yourselves clean, you who are carrying the utensils of Jehovah. ”
Many years before Isaiah wrote those words, good King Asa vigorously pursued a campaign to root out immorality in Judah.
(Read 1 Kings 15: 11 - 13.)
And centuries later, the apostle Paul told Titus that Jesus gave himself to cleanse his followers to make them “a people peculiarly his own, zealous for fine works. ”
