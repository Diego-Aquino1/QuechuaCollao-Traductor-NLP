"To become a responsible adult, your teenager must, in a figurative sense, gradually move from the passenger seat to the driver’s seat and learn to navigate life’s treacherous roadways." "Huk wayna allin poqosqa runaman tukupunanpaqqa pasajero hina kasqanmantan pisi - pisimanta choferman hina tukupunqa, millay carreterakunapitaq manejanan kanqa."

"After all, fair treatment is not always equal, and equal treatment is not always fair." "Waynakunan ichaqa huk hinamantaña imachus chanin kay kasqanta qhawarinku."
"Abstract thinking allows your teenager to grapple with such complex issues." "Allin reparaq kaymi yanapanqa chhayna sasa entiendena kaqkunata entiendenanpaq."

"For example, some parents have found that teenagers are more apt to open up while doing chores or while riding in the car, when they are side - by - side with a parent rather than face - to - face. ​ — Bible principle: Deuteronomy 6: 6, 7." "Wakin tayta - mamakunaqa uya - uyapura wawankuwan parlarinankumantaqa wasipi ruwanakunata kuska ruwaspa, carropi viajashaspan parlarinku, chaymi paykunataqa yanapan (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Deuteronomio 6: 6, 7)."
"Keep it brief." "Imachus ninallaykita niy."
"You do not have to argue every issue to the bitter end." "Yuyaymanachiyta munaspaqa ama ch’aqwata hatarichinaykikamachu rimapayay."
"Instead, make your point... and then stop." "Imachus ninallaykita nispa upallapuy."
"Most of your message will be “heard ” by your teenager later, when he’s alone and can ponder over what you’ve said. Give him a chance to do so. ​ — Bible principle: Proverbs 1: 1 - 4." "Chay qhepamanñan sapallan kashaspa nisqaykita yuyarispa chaykunapi yuyaymananqa, chaypaqqa tiempotan qonayki (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Proverbios 1: 1 - 4)."
"Listen ​ — and be flexible." "Uyariq kay amataq sinchita hark’aychu."

"Stay calm." "Ama usqhayllaqa phiñakuychu."
"“When we disagree, my mom takes offense at everything I say, ” says a teen named Kari.“ That just makes me upset, and the conversation snowballs into an argument. ”" "Kari sutiyoq sipasmi willakun: “Mamaywan rimayta mana tupachiqtiykuqa sientekunmi ima nisqaywanpas, chaymi ñoqapas phiñakullanitaq chay qhepamantaq ch’aqwa hatarin ”, nispa."
"Rather than overreact, say something that “mirrors ” your teen’s feelings." "Usqhaylla phiñakunaykimantaqa wawaykipi interesakusqaykita rikuchiy."
"For example, instead of saying, “That’s nothing to worry about! ” say,“ I can see how much this bothers you. ” ​ — Bible principle: Proverbs 10: 19." "“¡Chaymantachu llakikunki! ”, nispa ninaykimantaqa niwaqmi:“ Entiendenin imayna sientekusqaykita ”, nispa (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Proverbios 10: 19)."
"To the extent possible, guide, don’t dictate." "Yanapay sasachakuyninta allichananpaq."
"Your teen’s abstract thinking skills are like muscles that need to be developed." "Waynakuna reparaq kayta yachayninkuqa cuerponchis kallpayoq kananpaq ejercicio ruwaymanmi rikch’akun."
"So when he faces a dilemma, do not do his “exercising ” for him. As you discuss the matter, give him a chance to come up with some solutions of his own." "Wawayki ima sasachakuypipas tarikuqtinqa pay kikinmi allichanan, manan qanchu paypa rantinpi “ejerciciota ruwanayki ”."
"Then, after you have brainstormed a few options, you could say: “Those are a few possibilities." "Chay sasachakuymanta wawaykiwan parlarispa yanapay pay kikinmanta imayna allichayta qhawarinanpaq."
"Think them over for a day or two, and then we can get together again to talk about which solution you prefer and why. ” ​ — Bible principle: Hebrews 5: 14." "Imakunachus ruway atikusqanta qhawariqtintaq niwaq: “Iskay p’unchayta hina chaykunapi yuyaykuy chay qhepamantaq rimasun imachus decidesqaykimanta ”, nispa (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Hebreos 5: 14)."
"Although in this article we refer to the teenager as a male, the principles discussed apply to both genders." "Kay temapi waynakunallamanta rimashan chaypas, sipaskunatapas yanapanqan."
"Names in this article have been changed." "Sutikunan cambiakun."
"“Be swift about hearing, slow about speaking, slow about wrath. ” ​ — James 1: 19." "“Llamp’u simiwan kutichikuqqa phiñakuytan thasnun. ”"
"“An answer, when mild, turns away rage. ” ​ — Proverbs 15: 1." "(Proverbios 15: 1)"
"“Do not irritate your children, but bring them up tenderly with true Christian training and advice. ” ​ — Ephesians 6: 4, The New Testament in Modern Speech, by R. F." "“Wawaykichista ama phiñachiychischu aswanpas kasuchikuspa uywaychis, Señormanta yachachispa. ”"
"Weymouth. Do you want your parents to extend you more freedom?" "¿Munankichu tayta - mamayki ima ruwanaykipaqpas permiso qonasuykita?"
"Do you wish that they really understood you?" "¿Astawan entiendenasuykitachu munanki?"
"Talk openly." "Qanmantan chayqa kanqa."
"When you hold back, they cannot fully trust you ​ — and trust is the key to your getting more freedom." "Chaypaqqa sonqoykita kicharispan willanayki imakuna sucedesqasuykita."
"The point is, do not leave all the communication up to your parents." "Sichus mana llapantachu willanki chayqa manan qanpi confianqakuchu, confianza mana kaqtinqa manan ima ruwanaykipaqpas permisota qosunkikuchu."
"Do your part." "Ama ch’inllaqa uyariychu rimasqankuta."
"Tell your parents about your day. Ask them about theirs." "Qanpas imatachus p’unchaypi ruwarqanki chaykunata willay, tapuytaq paykunatapas imatachus ruwasqankumanta."
"If you have a complaint, learn how to express it respectfully." "Imamantapas quejakuyta munanki chayqa respetowan rimariy."
"Communication is a skill that you will need in adulthood. Why not acquire it now?" "Poqosqa runa kapuqtiykin allin rimaq kayta necesitanki, ¿manachu kunanmantapacha chaypaq kallpachakuwaq?"

"By contrast, many other parents are training their children to put others before self, and with great benefits." "Wakin tayta - mamakunan ichaqa wawankuman yachachinku hukkunapi interesakuyta, chaytan kasukuq wawakuna ruwashanku."
"Children who are considerate are more likely to make friends and to enjoy stable relationships. They are also more likely to be content." "Hukkunapi interesakuq wawakunaqa askha amigokunayoqmi kanku allintataqmi hukkunawan kawsankupas."
"Why? Because, as the Bible says, “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving. ” ​ — Acts 20: 35." "Hinaspapas aswan kusisqan kawsanku, Bibliapunin nin: “Aswan kusisamiyoqqa qoqmi chaskiqmantaqa ”, nispa."

"What is behind it." "Imaynapi paqarin."
"Sometimes a sense of entitlement can be traced back to how a person was raised." "Chayqa hamun imayna uywasqa kasqankumantan."

"The Bible acknowledges that praise is appropriate when it is deserved." "Biblian willan pitapas allin ruwasqanmanta alabay allin kasqanta."

"To refuse the householder’s hospitality is considered an insult, while accepting the offer is a compliment." "Mana kasukuqkunatan qhawarinku wasiyoqtapas pisichashankuman hinata, kasukuqkunataqmi ichaqa sumaq qhawarisqa kanku."

"“When a guest leaves a household, it isn’t enough to say, ‘ Good - bye, ’ ” says Joseph, a native of Cameroon.“ Often, the host will accompany the guest partway down the road and continue conversing with him." "Chay llaqtayoq Joseph nin: “Visitanku wasinkumanta ripuqtinqa manan ‘ huk p’unchaykama ’ nispallachu kachapunku, aswanmi parlan - parlan ñanta pusapunku."
"Then, at some point, he will bid the visitor farewell and return home." "Chaymantaña kachapuspataq wasinkuman kutipunku."

"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"Some think that Paradise is nothing more than a myth." "Wakin runakunan Paraisomanta rimaspa ninku: “Ñawpa machulakunaq rimaynillanmi ”, nispa."
"Others believe that it is a gardenlike utopia where good people live forever and share in joyful and productive activities." "Hukkunataq ninku: “Allin runakunalla wiñaypaq sumaq kawsasqankumanta mosqokuy hinallan ”, nispa."
"The word “paradise ” has been used to designate mankind’s first home, the garden of Eden." "“Paraíso ” nispaqa runakunapaq Diospa ruwasqan Edén huertamantan rimashan (Génesis 2: 7 - 15)."
"The Bible presents that garden as a real place where the first human couple lived free of disease and death." "Bibliaq nisqan hina, Diospa kamasqan ñawpaq warmi qharin chay huertapi tiyarqanku mana onqospa mana wañuspa (Génesis 1: 27 - 28)."
"Because they disobeyed God, the first couple lost their paradisaic home." "Paykunaqa Diosta mana kasukusqankumantan chay huertamanta qarqochikurqanku."
"However, many Bible prophecies describe a future in which humans will enjoy Paradise restored." "Ichaqa Biblian willan hamuq tiempopi chhayna sumaq Paraisopi runakuna tiyanankumanta."
"If God is loving, then it would make sense that he would reward his faithful worshippers with a good life in such a place as Paradise." "Diosqa ancha munakuqmi, chaymi pay sonqo runakunaman huk Paraisopi sumaq kawsayta qonqa. Ichaqa, ¿imatan ruwananchis kamachinkunata hina chaskiwananchispaq?"
"It would also make sense that he would inform people about what they need to do in order to gain God’s approval." "Bibliaq nisqan hina, astawanmi paymanta yachananchis chayman hinataqmi kawsananchis."
"The Bible says that you can gain God’s approval by taking in knowledge of him and obeying his commands. ​ — John 17: 3; 1 John 5: 3." "“Señor Diosmi Edenpi huertata plantarqan [...] hinaspan ruwasqan runata chayman churarqan. ”"
"“Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden,... and there he put the man whom he had formed. ” ​ — Genesis 2: 8." "(Génesis 2: 8.)"
"Some believe that Paradise is in heaven, while others claim that it will be established in the future on earth." "Wakin runakunan ninku: “Paraisoqa hanaq pachapin kashan ”, nispa."
"The original Paradise for mankind was on earth." "Hukkunataq ninku: “Qhepamanmi kay Hallp’a paraisoman tukupunqa ”, nispa."
"God has clearly designated the earth as the permanent home for humans." "Diosmi runakunapaq Hallp’ata kamarqan chaypitaqmi huk sumaq paraisota ruwarqan runakuna wiñaypaq tiyanankupaq."
"The Bible says that God made our planet to last forever." "Biblian willan kay Hallp’aqa mana hayk’aq tukukunanpaq kamasqa kasqanta (Salmo 104: 5)."
"It also states: “To Jehovah the heavens belong, but the earth he has given to the sons of men. ” ​ — Psalm 115: 16." "Hinaspapas ninmi: “Hanaq pachaqa Señor Diospa kaqninmi, kay pachatataqmi runaman qorqan ”, nispa (Salmo 115: 16)."
"It is not surprising, then, that the Bible holds out the promise of Paradise on earth." "Chaymi mana admirakunachu kay Hallp’a paraisoman tukunanpaq Bibliaq willasqanmanta."
"In it, God will bless mankind with everlasting life." "Chaypin Dios runakunaman wiñay kawsayta qonqa."
"Harmony and peace will prevail." "Chaypiqa manan pipas ñak’arinqachu nitaq nanayta muchunqachu."
"Pain and suffering will be gone." "Llapa runakunan thakpi kusisqa tiyanqaku."
"And people will be able to enjoy to the full the natural wonders of planet earth. ​ — Isaiah 65: 21 - 23." "Diospa tukuy imaymana ruwasqanwanmi kusikunqaku (Isaías 65: 21 - 23)."
"“The tent of God is with mankind,... and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. ” ​ — Revelation 21: 3, 4." "“Runakunawanñan Diosqa tiyan, [...] manan wañuypas kanqañachu, manallataqmi llakikuypas, waqaypas, nanaypas kanqañachu. ” (Apocalipsis 21: 3, 4.)"
"Many religions teach that only good people will live in Paradise." "Askha religionkunan yachachinku, “allin runakunallan Paraisopiqa tiyanqaku ”, nispa."
"But there is much confusion as to what “good ” means." "Ichaqa manan yachankuchu pikunan chay “allin runakuna ” kasqanta."
"Some think that it is enough simply to participate in religious ceremonies and ritualistic prayers." "Wakinqa religionninkupi costumbrekuna hunt’asqankuwan rezasqankuwan iman allin runapaq qhawarikunku."
"The Bible teaches that “the righteous ” will live in Paradise." "Biblian willan “chanin runakuna ” Paraisopi tiyanankuta."
"But who is righteous in God’s eyes?" "¿Pikunatan Dios chaninpaq qhawarin?"
"Not the person who engages in the rituals of his religion while ignoring God’s will." "¿Diospa munasqanta qhepanchaspa religionninpi costumbrekuna ruwaqtachu?"
"The Bible says: “Does Jehovah have as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of Jehovah?" "Manan, Biblian nin: “Señor Diospa qayllanpi aswan allinqa kasukuymi ruphachina sacrificiota wak sacrificiotawan haywaymantaqa."
"Look! To obey is better than a sacrifice. ”" "Aswan allinqa uyarikuymi, kasukuymi uywakunaq wiran ruphachinamantaqa ”, nispa (1 Samuel 15: 22)."
"Simply put, “the righteous ” who will live forever in Paradise are the ones who obey God’s commands as outlined in the Bible." "Paraisopi wiñaypaq tiyaq “chanin runakunaqa ”, Bibliapi Diospa kamachikusqanta kasukuqkunan kanqaku."
"Obedience to God’s commandments involves more than participation in religious ceremonies." "Diospa sonqonta kusichinaykipaqqa Bibliatan allinta t’aqwirinayki."
"By your everyday conduct, you may either please or displease God." "Payqa manan mana hunt’ay atinatachu imatapas kamachiwanchis."
"You can learn to please God by carefully examining the Bible." "Biblia willan ‘ kamachikuyninkunaqa mana sinchi sasachu ’ kasqanta."
"And he is not hard to please." "Kasukuq runakunamantaqmi Paraisopi kawsayta qonqa."
"The Bible says that “his commandments are not burdensome. ” God is eager to reward your obedience by granting you entrance into Paradise." "“Chanin runakunaqa kay hallp’atan hap’ikapunqaku, chaypin wiñaypaq tiyanqaku. ”"
"“The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it. ” ​ — Psalm 37: 29." "(Salmo 37: 29.)"
"WAS IT DESIGNED?" "¿KIKILLANMANTACHU PAQARIMURQAN?"
"THE bar - tailed godwit makes one of the most amazing migrations known to man." "AGUJA colipinta karuta phalasqanmi llapa runakunata anchata admirachin."
"The bird’s 7,000 - mile (11,000 km) journey can take more than eight days." "Mana samarispan pusaq p’unchayta otaq mastapas 11.000 kilometrota phalan."
"Consider: Researchers speculate that some types of birds use the earth’s magnetic field for navigation, as if they had a compass built into their brain." "Kaypi yuyaykuy: Investigaqkunan ninku wakin phalaq animalkunaqa umankupipas huk brujulayoq kankuman hina kay pachapi kaq kallpawan (campo magnético) yanapachikusqankuta."
"It is possible that the godwit additionally navigates by means of the sun by day and the stars by night." "Aguja colipinta animalqa yaqapaschá punch’aypi phalananpaq Inti maymanchus risqanwan yanapachikun tutatataq ch’askakunawan."
"It seems that the godwit can also sense upcoming storm systems that could allow it to benefit from tailwinds." "Hinaspapas wayrakunaq hamusqanta reparaspan chaykunawan yanapachikullanmantaq."
"Still, the details of just how these birds make their incredible journey baffle experts." "Imaynaña kanman chaypas, investigaqkunaqa manan yachankuraqchu imaynapi chhayna karu phalasqanta."
"“I’ve been studying them 20 years, ” says biologist Bob Gill,“ and it’s still jaw - dropping to me. ”" "Bob Gill biologon nin: “Chay animaltan 20 wataña estudiashani, chaywanpas kunankaman sinchita admirachiwan ”, nispa."
"What Do You Think?" "¿Ima ninkin chaymanta?"
"Did the navigational system of the bar - tailed godwit come about by evolution? Or was it designed?" "¿Kikillanmantachu kay animal chhayna karu phalayta yacharqan icha kamasqachu karqan?"

"Because no two people are exactly alike ​ — a fact that can add either variety or tension to marriage." "Manapunin iskay runaqa kaqllapuniqa kankumanchu, chaykunan casarakuy kawsayta munayyachin, ichaqa phiñachinakuytapas apamullanmantaqmi."

"On separate sheets of paper, each of you should write down the topic of a recent argument." "Sapankaykichis qelqaychis imamantachus chayllaraq phiñachinakusqaykichismanta."

"He is an associate editor of three international science magazines and has coauthored more than a hundred scientific papers. He studies how humans recognize faces and do such seemingly simple things as catching a ball. He then designs visual systems for robots ​ — systems that imitate what we do." "Payqa estudianmi imaynapi uyakuna reqsisqanchista, mana sasa ruwaykunata ruwasqanchistapas, chaymi kanman bolata hap’iy, hinaspapas robotkunaq (runaman rikch’akuq máquina) ñawin imayna kanantan ruwan runaq ñawinman rikch’akuqta hina."
Awake! ¡Rikch’ariy!
"asked him about his faith and his work as a scientist." "revistata qelqaqkunan tapurqanku iñiyninmanta, científico kasqanpi llank’ayninmantapas."
"What is your religious background?" "¿Familiayki Diospi iñiqchu?"
"My parents were nonpracticing Catholics. As a young man, I leaned toward atheism." "Tayta - mamayqa católico religionmantan karqanku, ichaqa manan participaqkuchu."
"I was taught that life originated by means of evolution, and I accepted that as fact." "Waynallaraq kashaspaymi “Diosqa manan kanchu ” nisqa yachachikuypi creerqani,“ runaqa yanqallamantan paqarimurqan ” nisqa yachachikuytapas cheqaqpaqmi qhawarirqani."
"Yet, even though I did not believe in a personal Creator, I felt that there must be something higher than us." "Tukuyta Kamaqpi manaña creerqanichu chaypas ñoqaqa creerqanin runamanta aswan atiyniyoq imapas kasqanpi."
"In order to find out what, I explored Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism, but I found their teachings to be unsatisfactory." "Chaymi t’aqwirqani budismo, hinduismo, taoísmo nisqa yachachikuykunata, ichaqa manan tapukuyniykunaq kutichiyninta tarirqanichu."
"What led to your interest in science?" "¿Imaraykun cienciamanta yachayta munarqanki?"
"From childhood, I was fascinated with machines." "Huch’uyllaraq kashaspaymi yachayta munarqani maquinakunamanta."
"I even used to take my electric toys apart and reassemble them." "Corrientewan funcionaq pukllanaykunatapas paskaruspaymi hukmanta kawirachipuq kani."
"And I would ply my father, a telecommunications engineer, with endless questions about how radios and telephones work." "Taytayqa huk empresapi llank’asqanraykun allinta yachaq radiokuna telefonokunapas imayna funcionasqanta, chaymi sapa kutilla tapuq kani chaykunamanta."
"What has your career as a scientist involved?" "¿Imakunatan estudiarqanki?"
"I studied electronic engineering at the University of Genoa, and then I did doctoral research in robot design." "Ingeniería Electronicatan estudiarqani Universidad de Génova nisqapi astawanmi yacharqani robotkunamanta."
"I specialized in studying the human visual system and in devising ways to imitate it for the design of robots." "Runaq ñawinmantan astawan yacharqani, chayman hinataqmi robotkunaq ñawin imayna kananta ruwaq kani."
"Why did our visual system interest you?" "¿Imaraykun yachayta munarqanki runaq ñawinmanta?"
"It is incredibly sophisticated, encompassing much more than the eyes ​ — it even includes the means to interpret what we see." "Imayna ruwasqa kasqanqa admirakunapaqmi, ñawiqa yanapawanchismi rikusqanchisman hina ruwanapaq."
"For example, consider what happens when you catch a ball." "Yachanapaq, huk bolatapas hap’iyta munawaq hinata yuyaykuy."
"As you run to make the catch, the lens of your eye focuses an image of the ball onto your retina." "Hap’inaykipaq p’itasqaykiman hinan ñawipi cristalino nisqa chayachin retina nisqaman bolaq imayna kasqanta."
"That image will move across your retina in a way that depends on the movement of both the ball and your eye." "Bolaq imayna kasqanqa retina nisqantan pasanqa bolaqpas ñawiqpas kuyusqanman hina."
"Normally, of course, you keep your eye fixed on the ball. Its image then becomes stationary on your retina while the background “moves. ”" "Ichaqa astawanqa ñawiqa bolallatan qhawan, chhayna kaqtinqa bolaq imayna kasqanmi retina nisqapi grabasqa hina qhepan, bolata qhawasqanchispi imakunachus rikusqanchistaq kuyun."
"At the same time, your visual system calculates the speed of the ball and its trajectory." "Chaymantapas ñawinchisqa tanteanmi bola imayna kallpawan hamusqanta mayninta hamusqantapas."
"Amazingly, the calculations start right there in the retina as your eye estimates the movement of the ball in relation to its background." "Chaytaqa ñawinchis ukhupi retina nisqan tantean, ñawinchistaq reparan bolaq hamusqanpi imakuna kasqanta."
"Your optic nerve then transmits the impulses formed by the retina to your brain, which further analyzes the information and directs you to intercept the ball." "Chay qhepamanmi retina nisqapi bolaq imayna kasqanta nervio óptico willan ñosqhonninchisman, ñosqhonninchistaq chayta reparaspa kamachiwanchis bolata hap’inapaq."
"The whole process is breathtaking in its complexity." "Chaykunata yachayqa admirakunapaqmi."
"What persuaded you to believe in a Creator?" "¿Imaraykun creepurqanki Dios tukuyta Kamaq kasqanpi?"
"In 1990, I spent a few months in Dublin, Ireland, doing research at Trinity College." "1990 watapin pisi killakunalla kamurqani Dublín (Irlanda) llaqtapi, Trinity College nisqapi yachay munasqayta t’aqwispa."
"As I was traveling home with my wife, Barbara, we considered the future of our children." "Chaymanta kutimpushaspaymi esposay Barbarawan wawakunamanta rimanakurqayku, panaytapas visitarqaykun."
"We also decided to visit my sister who was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses." "Payqa Jehová Diospa testigonmi karqan, qowarqantaqmi huk librota, La vida... ¿cómo se presentó aquí?"
"My sister gave me a copy of the book Life ​ — How Did It Get Here?" "¿Por evolución, o por creación?"
"By Evolution or by Creation? published by the Witnesses." "nisqata, admirakurqanin allin chaninchasqata chay libro imatapas sut’inchasqanmanta."
"The careful research that had gone into this work impressed me. It then dawned on me that I had accepted evolution without really questioning it." "Chaypin repararqani “runaqa yanqallamantan paqarimun ” nisqa yachachikuymanta mana allinta yachaspay cheqaqpaq qhawarisqayta."
"For example, I had assumed that evolution was well supported by the fossil record. But it is not." "Ñoqaqa creerqanin ñawpa tiempokunapi animalkunaq kawsasqanmanta señalkuna tarisqankuqa chay yachachikuyta sut’inchasqanta."
"Indeed, the more I examined evolution, the more I became convinced that the theory is more bluster than fact." "Ichaqa astawan chaymanta yachaspaymi entienderqani “runaqa yanqallamantan paqarimun ” nisqa yachachikuy yanqa kasqanta."
"I thought about my work with robots." "Yuyaykurqanin imapichus llank’asqaypi."
"Whose designs was I imitating?" "¿Pin ñawpaqta ruwarqan imakunatapas copiakusqayta?"
"Then I thought about my work with robots." "Hinan yuyaykurqani imapichus llank’asqaypi."
"Whose designs was I imitating?" "¿Pin ñawpaqta ruwarqan imakunatapas copiakusqayta?"
"I could never design a robot capable of catching a ball as we can." "Ñoqaqa manan hayk’aqpas huk robottaqa ruwayta atiymanchu kikillanmanta bola hap’iqtaqa."
"A robot can be programmed to catch a ball, but only in precisely controlled conditions." "Huk robotqa kamachillaqtiykin bolataqa hap’in, mana chayqa manan imatapas ruwanchu."
"It cannot do so in circumstances for which it has not been programmed. Our ability to learn is vastly superior to that of a machine ​ — and mere machines have makers!" "Robotkunaqa hukpa ruwasqanmi, ichaqa huk runaqa aswan yachayniyoqmi maquinakunamantaqa, ¿pin runakunata kamarqan?"
"This fact is just one of many that led me to conclude that we must have had a Designer." "Chaykunata qhawarispaymi ñoqaqa yuyaykurqani “runataqa hukpunichá ruwarqan ” nispa."
"Why did you become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?" "¿Imarayku Jehová Diospa testigon kapurqanki?"
"In part, it was because Barbara and I liked their thorough study methods." "Esposaywanmi ancha allinpaq qhawarirqayku yachachikuykuna imayna t’aqwisqankuta."
"I was especially impressed with the research that goes into their publications." "Qelqakuna horqosqankupas allin chaninchasqatan imatapas yachachin."
"Solid research appeals to people like me, who want to probe into the details of things." "Ñoqa hina imamantapas yachay munaqkunaqa ancha chaninpaqmi qhawarinku chhayna allin t’aqwisqa qelqakunataqa."
"For example, I became deeply interested in the many prophecies, or predictions, in the Bible." "Hamuq tiempopi imakunachus sucedenanmanta Bibliaq willasqanmantaqa anchatan yachayta munarqani."
"My study of those convinced me that the Bible really is from God. In 1992, Barbara and I were baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses." "Chaykunamanta astawan yachaspaymi repararqani Bibliaqa Diospa qelqan kasqanta. 1992 watapin esposaywan bautizakurqayku Jehová Diospa testigon kapunaykupaq."
"Has your study of science weakened your faith?" "¿Cienciamanta yachasqayki pisiyachirqanchu iñiynikita?"
"On the contrary, science has strengthened my faith." "Manan, aswanpas astawanmi kallpachawarqan."
"For example, consider how we recognize faces." "Kaypi yuyaykuy, runakunaqa hukpa uyanta qhawayuspallan yachanchis pichus kasqanta."
"A baby can do this within hours after birth." "Chaytaqa nacesqanchismanta pisi horakuna qhepallamanmi ruwayta qallarinchis."
"You and I can instantly recognize someone we know, even if he is in a crowd." "Askha runakunaq kasqanpipas amigonchistaqa reqsiyta atinchismi."
"We may even discern his emotional state." "Hinaspapas reparanchismi llakisqachus kusisqachus kasqantapas."
"Yet, we may be completely unaware that this recognition involves the processing of a phenomenal amount of information at an incredible speed." "Ichaqa manapaschá cuentata qokunchischu chayta ruwanapaqqa ñawinchispas ñosqhonninchispas usqhaylla imaymanakuna ruwasqankuta."
"Yes, I am fully convinced that our visual system is a precious gift from Jehovah God." "Ñawinchisqa Jehová Diospa qowasqanchismi, chaymantaqa manan iskayyanichu."

"If he makes his payments regularly, he’ll earn the bank’s trust and the bank may even extend more credit to him in the future." "Llapanta pagapuqtinqa vendeqnin runan manaña iskayyanqañachu, qhepakunapipas aswan askhataraqmi manushallanqa."
"It’s similar at home. You owe your parents your obedience." "Qanpas manupi hinan kashanki tayta - mamaykipaq, chayqa kasukuyniykin."

"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"“Everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. ” ​ — Matthew 5: 28." "“Pipas huk warmita munapakuspa qhawaqqa ñan sonqonpi chay warmiwan wasanchay huchata ruwanña ” (Mateo 5: 28)"
"Today pornography is more popular and accessible than ever before." "Kay tiempopiqa tukuyneqpin kashan qhelli qhawaykuna chaymi askha runakuna qhawanku."
"If you wish to please God and live a happier life, you should know how God feels about pornography." "Diospaq hina kawsaspa kusisqa kayta munanki chayqa yachanaykin imatachus Dios chaykuna qhawaymanta yuyaykusqanta."
"The Bible does not mention pornography specifically." "Bibliaqa manan rimanchu qhelli qhawaykunamanta, ichaqa Bibliapi tarikuq kamachikuykunata leespan reparasunman huchachasqanta."
"Still, the use of pornography is in direct conflict with many Bible principles." "Bibliaqa sut’itan willan sichus huk qhari wak ‘ warmita munapakuspa qhawan ’ chayqa wasanchay huchamanmi urmanman."
"For instance, the Bible pointedly states that when a married man “keeps on looking at a woman ” to whom he is not married, nurturing a desire to have sex with her, it can lead to adultery." "Chayqa kaqllataqmi qhelli ruwaykunata ‘ qhawaywan ’ casarasqaña otaq solteroña kanman chaypas."
"The principle behind this Bible statement would apply to anyone, married or single, who “keeps on looking ” at pornographic images with the desire to engage in sexual immorality." "Chaykunata qhawaqqa rikusqankunatan munapayan."
"Such behavior is clearly offensive to God." "Chayta ruwayqa Jehová Diostan phiñachin."
"“Deaden, therefore, your body members... as respects fornication, uncleanness, sexual appetite, hurtful desire, and covetousness. ” ​ — Colossians 3: 5." "“Millay ruwaykunamanta t’aqakuychis, ama qhelli huchapi puriychischu, [...] ama cuerpoykichispa munasqanta ruwaychischu, ama mana allinta yuyaykuychischu, ama munapayaychischu ” (Colosenses 3: 5)"
"Some researchers doubt that there is a significant link between pornography and real acts of sexually offensive behavior." "Chaykunamanta estudiaq runakunan ninku “qhellikunata qhawayqa manan runakunata tanqanchu qhelli huchakuna ruwayman ” nispa."
"Yet, is the use of pornography in itself immoral?" "Chhaynaqa, ¿allillanchu qhellikunata qhaway?"
"The Bible describes “obscene jesting ” as unacceptable and immoral." "Bibliaqa qhelli ruwaykunata hinan huchachan “asichikuq qhelli simikunatapas ”."
"How could pornography be any less objectionable?" "Ichaqa qhellikunata qhawayqa aswan millayraqmi."
"Today’s pornography often includes the visual recording of real acts of adultery, homosexuality, and other forms of fornication." "Qhelli qhawaykunapiqa rikukunmi warmiwan qhariwan wasanchay hucha ruwasqanku, warmipura otaq qharipura t’inkinakusqanku, huk qhelli ruwaykunapas."
"Surely, the lascivious viewing of such sexually immoral acts is significantly more offensive to God than obscene speech." "Asichikuq qhelli simikunata rimayqa phiñachinmi Diosta, sinchi munapayaywan qhellikunata qhawaymi ichaqa astawanraq."
"Researchers continue to debate the likelihood of people acting out fantasies fueled by pornography." "Qhellikunata qhawaqkuna rikusqankuta hinachus ruwanku icha manachus chaymantaqa wakinmi ninku “chhaynan ” nispa wakintaq“ manan ” nispa."
"But the Bible clearly supports the notion that the use of pornography is in itself spiritually destructive and highly offensive to God." "Biblian ichaqa sut’ita willan runaq iñiyninpaq mana allin kasqanta Diospas chay ruwayta cheqnikusqanta."
"The Bible gives this admonition: “Deaden, therefore, your body members... as respects fornication [and] sexual appetite. ”" "Chaymi kamachiwanchis: “Millay ruwaykunamanta t’aqakuychis, ama qhelli huchapi puriychischu [...], ama cuerpoykichispa munasqanta ruwaychischu ”, nispa."
"Users of pornography do exactly the opposite ​ — rather than deadening such desires, they nurture and inflame them." "Qhellikunata qhawaqkunaqa manan chaykunamanta t’aqakushankuchu aswanpas astawanraqmi munapayashanku."
"“Search for what is good, and not what is bad..." "“Allinkaqta maskhaychis, amataq mana allinkaqtachu [...]"
"Hate what is bad, and love what is good. ” ​ — Amos 5: 14, 15." "¡Allinkaqta munakuychis! ” (Amós 5: 14, 15)"
"The Bible speaks of sexually promiscuous people, drunkards, and thieves, who were able to quit their destructive behavior." "Wakin cristianokunaqa ñawpaqpin karqanku qhelli huchapi puriq, machaq suwakuq ichaqa chhayna kawsayninkutan saqepurqanku."
How? "¿Imaynapin saqepurqanku?"
"By applying the wisdom found in God’s Word, they learned to hate what is bad." "Diospa Simin Qelqapi kamachikuykunatan yacharqanku, chhaynapin mana allin kaqkunata cheqnikapurqanku."
"It is possible to learn to hate pornography by giving careful thought to the terrible consequences of this harmful vice." "Qhellikunata qhawaqkunaqa mana allinkunapin tarikunku, chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa cheqnikunkin chay ruwayta."
"A recent study published by Utah State University revealed that some pornography users experience “depression, social isolation, damaged relationships, ” and other sad consequences." "Utah llaqtapi (Estados Unidos) Universidadmi willarqan qhellikunata qhawaqkunaqa “sinchi llakipi kasqankuta, runakunamanta karunchakusqankuta, hukkunawan mana allinta kawsasqankuta ” huk mana allinkunapi tarikusqankutapas."
"What is more, because, as explained earlier, the viewing of pornography is offensive to God, it does something far more harmful." "Chaykunamanta aswan mana allinqa Diosmantan runakunata karunchan hinaspapas Jehová Diostan phiñachin."
"It alienates humans from their Creator. The Bible can help us learn to love what is good." "Bibliaq yachachikuyninkunan yanapawasun allin kaqkunata munakunapaq."
"The more we read the Bible, the deeper our love for its moral standards will grow." "Astawan Bibliata leesun chayqa astawanmi munakusun kamachikuyninkunata."
"That love will help us to take a firm stand against pornography and to feel the way the psalmist did who wrote: “I shall not set in front of my eyes any good - for - nothing thing. ” ​ — Psalm 101: 3." "Chay munakuymi yanapawasun qhelli qhawaykunata cheqnikunapaq, chhaynapitaqmi salmista hina nisunchis: “Manapunin ima millaykunapipas yuyasaqchu ”, nispa (Salmo 101: 3)."
"WAS IT DESIGNED?" "¿KIKILLANMANTACHU PAQARIMURQAN?"
"THE jumping spider has a special vision system that enables it to calculate the precise distance it needs to jump." "SALTAQ arañaq rikusqanqa hukniraymi, payqa k’apaktan yachan ima hap’iy munasqanpas imayna karupi kasqanta."
"How does the spider do it?" "¿Imaynatan chayta ruwan?"
"Consider: To measure its distance from an object, the jumping spider exploits a unique feature of its two principal eyes, each of which has a “staircase ” retina with multiple layers." "Kaypi yuyaykuy: Chayta ruwananpaqqa iskay hatun ñawinkunawanmi yanapachikun. Ñawin ukhunpin askha capakuna kan."
"While one layer receives green light in sharp focus, another receives it as a blurry image." "Iskay capakunan reparan q’omer kaqkunata, chaykunamantan huknin ch’uyata rikun huknintaq ayphata."
"The more out of focus an image appears in that layer, the closer the object is to the spider’s eye." "Ima rikusqanpas aswan ladonpi kaqtinqa aswan ayphatan rikun."
"This simple fact enables the spider to calculate the exact distance it has to jump to catch its prey." "Chhaynapin chay arañaqa k’apakta p’itanqa ima hap’iy munasqanman."
"Researchers would like to copy the jumping spider’s technique in order to create 3 - D cameras and even robots that can measure the distance to an object." "Chay arañamanta allinta yachaq runakunaqa chayta qhawarispan ruwayta munanku aswan ch’uyay - chu’yay fotota horqoq camarakunata, hinallataq ima rikusqankutapas imayna karupi kashasqanta yachaq robotkunatapas."
"According to the online news site ScienceNOW, the jumping spider’s vision provides “an exciting example of how half - centimeter - long [0.2 in.] animals with brains smaller than those of house flies still manage to gather and act on complex visual information. ”" "Internetpi ScienceNOW noticiakunata willaqmi saltaq arañamanta nirqan: “Chay arañakunaqa kuskan centímetro hinallan, ñosqonninpas ch’uspiq ñosqhonninmantaqa aswan huch’uyraqmi chaywanpas imatapas hap’inanpaq k’apakta rikusqanqa admirakunapaqmi ”, nispa."
"What do you think?" "¿Ima ninkin chaymanta?"
"Did the use of blurry vision by the jumping spider come about by evolution? Or was it designed?" "¿Kikillanmantachu saltaq araña chhayna rikuq karqan icha kamasqachu karqan?"

"It also says: “He is... hanging the earth upon nothing. ”" "Nillantaqmi Diosqa ‘ ch’usaqpin hallp’a pachata warkuykun ’ nispa (Job 26: 7)."
"At that time, I was using satellite photographs to study ecology, so these scriptures impressed me. They were written long before anyone photographed the circle of the earth hanging on nothing." "Ñoqaqa astawanmi yachasharqani animalkunapas plantakunawan imaynata huk hinalla kawsasqankumanta, chaypaqmi yanapachikusharqani kay hallp’a pachata hanaq pachamanta orqosqa fotokunawan, chaymi chay textokunaq nisqanqa sonqoyman chayawarqan, chaykunaqa qelqakurqan chay fotokuna manaraq kashaqtinmi."
"As my wife and I studied the Bible with Steve and Sandy, I learned of prophecies that had come true, advice that works, and explanations that satisfied me." "Esposay Debbiewan kuskan Bibliata estudiarqayku Steve, Sandy Testigokunawan, chaypin yacharqani Bibliaq willasqan ñawpaqpi hunt’akusqanta, allinta kawsanapaq yanapaykunata, allinta imatapas sut’inchasqantapas."
"Gradually, I became convinced that the Bible is the Word of God." "Pisi - pisimantan entienderqani Bibliaqa Diospa qelqan kasqanta."
"When did you change your mind about the origin of life?" "¿Imaynapin creerqanki tukuy kawsayta Dios kamaq kasqanpi?"
"Eventually, Steve showed me the Bible’s clear statement: “Jehovah God proceeded to form the man out of dust from the ground. ”" "Huk kutinmi Steve Bibliapi kay textota leewarqan: ‘ Ñut’u hallp’amantan Señor Diosqa runata ruwarqan ’, nispa (Génesis 2: 7)."
"The first man has a documented life history. This raised the question: Is the Bible in harmony with scientific facts?" "Bibliaqa sut’itan willasqa imaynapi ñawpaq runa rikhurimusqanta, hinan tapukurqani: “¿Cienciaq nisqanwan chay tupanmanchu? ”, nispa."
"Steve encouraged me to research the matter, so I did." "Steveqa niwarqanmi chaymanta astawan yachanaypaq chaytataqmi ruwarqani."
"What did you learn about evolution?" "¿Imatan yacharqanki?"
"Many things." Askhatan.
"To mention just one, the evolution theory attempts to explain the origin of species." "Evolucionpi creeqkunaqa yachachiytan munanku imaynapi tukuy kawsay paqarimusqanta."
"Living things are made up of efficient organs, such as the heart, lungs, and eyes." "Cuerponchis ukhupiqa kanmi sorq’anninchis, sonqonchis, ñawinchiskunapas chaykunaqa kusatan llank’anku."
"Also, at the microscopic level, we see marvelously designed ‘ machines ’ within cells." "Ichaqa ñawinchispa mana rikunan célula nisqakunan cuerponchispi kallantaq, chaykuna ukhupipas kallantaqmi kusata llank’aq imaymanakuna."
"Where do the designs for those come from?" "¿Imaynapin sorq’anpas, sonqopas, ñawikunapas, célula ukhupi kaqkunapas rikhurirqan?"
"Evolutionists claim that the best mechanisms are automatically selected because the living things that have them survive better." "“Tukuy imapas kikillanmantan paqarimurqan ” niqkunaqa ninkun:“ Kikillanmantan chaykunaqa rikhurirqan aswan kallpayoq kaqkunallapi ”, nispa."
"But that idea does not answer the question: Where do the mechanisms come from?" "Ichaqa chay nisqankuqa manan kutichinchu chay tapuyta."
"I learned that many scientists do not believe that the evolution theory answers that question." "Manan llapa cientificokunachu “kikillanmantan tukuy imapas paqarimurqan ” nisqa yachachikuypiqa creenku."
"A professor of zoology confided to me that he did not believe any of the theories of evolution. However, he did not air his views for fear of losing his job." "Animalkunaq kawsayninmanta allinta yachaq profesormi huk kutin niwarqan payqa chay yachachikuypi mana creesqanta, ichaqa llank’ananmanta mana qarqochikunanraykus mana hukkunaman chayta willanchu."
"Does your knowledge of ecology strengthen your faith?" "¿Ecología nisqamanta yachasqayki yanaparqasunkichu iñiyniykipi?"
"Yes, it does." "Arí yanapawarqanmi."
"My work involved studying how living things depend on each other." "Ñoqaqa t’aqwinin kawsayniyoq kaqkuna imaynata hukkunawan kawsasqankuta."
"On earth, all living things depend on something else." "Llapa kawsaqniyoqkunaqa hukkunamantan kawsanku."
"Consider flowers and bees, for example." "Yachasun t’ikamanta abejamantawan."
"The color, fragrance, nectar, and structure of flowers are designed to attract bees and to sprinkle them with pollen." "T’ikakunaqa sumaqtan q’apan, chay t’ikaq misk’inpas imayna kasqanpas munaymi, chayta rikuspan abejakunaqa chay t’ikakunaman rinku chhaynapin muhunkunawan k’askachikunku."
"Bees are designed to extract nectar and to take one flower’s pollen to another plant for fertilization." "Abejakunaqa t’ikaq misk’intan ch’onqanku chayman hinataq chay t’ikaq ch’iñi muhuchankunata huk t’ikakunaman apanku chhaynapi miranankupaq."
"Clearly, the flowers and bees are designed to supply what the other needs." "Chaymi rikuchin iskayninkupas yanapanakusqankuta."
"‘ The resilience of the entire system of life on earth convinces me that life was designed by God ’" "Animalkunapas plantakunawan huk hinalla kawsasqanku sasata chinkasqanmi rikuchin chaykuna Diospa kamasqan kasqanta"
"In an ecosystem, we see interdependence on a vast scale. An ecosystem is an environment with a community of perhaps thousands of types of animals, plants, bacteria, and fungi." "Askha animalkuna may tiyasqanpiqa imaymana plantakunan kan, huch’uy kurukuna imaymana k’allanpakunapas, chaypin astawanqa rikukun hukkuna hukkunawan yanapanakusqankuta."
"All animals depend on plants for food and oxygen, and most flowering plants depend on animals." "Animalkunaqa plantakunatan mikhunku, yaqa llapan t’ikayoq kaq plantakunataq necesitanku animalkunaq yanapayninta mana chinkanankupaq."
"Although ecosystems are exceedingly complex and the organisms in them are fragile, they may continue surviving for millennia." "Animalkunaqpas plantakunaqpas huk hinalla kawsasqankuqa chinkallanmanmi chaywanpas waranqa watakunan chaykunaqa mana chinkarqanchu."
"Even after damage by pollution, once the source of pollution is gone, a complex ecosystem soon develops again." "Mayukunata qhellichasqanku, sach’akunata wit’usqankupas q’ara pampamanmi tukuchin, ichaqa chaykunata manaña ruwapuqtinkuqa usqhayllan wakmanta mirarillankutaq."
"When I think about the resilience of the entire system of life on earth, I am convinced that life was designed by God." "Diosmi kawsaytaqa qowanchis, chaymantaqa manan iskayyanichu, animalkunapas plantakunawan huk hinalla kawsaspa sasata chinkasqanmi chayta rikuchin."
"Why did you become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?" "¿Imaraykun Jehová Diospa testigon kapurqanki?"
"I was deeply concerned about the way human society is ruining the environment." "Runakunaqa manan cuidankuchu chhayna sumaq kawsaykunata, chaywanmi sonqoy sinchita nanawaq."
"I knew that although ecosystems are resilient, they are not indestructible." "Chay kawsaykunaqa manan usqhayllachu chinkanku ichaqa runaqa chinkachinmanmi."
"I learned from Jehovah’s Witnesses that, according to the Scriptures, God will “bring to ruin those ruining the earth. ”" "Jehová Diospa testigonkunan ichaqa rikuchiwarqanku Bibliaq kay nisqanta: “Chayarqamullantaqmi kay pacha waqllichiqkunata wañuchinayki p’unchaypas ”, nispa."
"Those words were important to me." "Chayqa ancha allinpunin ñoqapaq karqan."
"I enjoy sharing my beliefs with others, and I have studied the Bible with some scientists." "Tiempowanqa yacharqanin Bibliaq prometesqanqa mana iskayanapaq kasqanta."
"At age 55, I took early retirement to spend more time helping people to understand the Creator of life and his purpose for our magnificent earth." "Anchatan munani iñiyniymanta rimaytaqa, wakin científico runakunamanpas Bibliamantan yachachirqani. 55 wataypin llank’anaymanta jubilakurqani chhaynapi kawsay qowaqninchis Diosmanta, kay pachapaq imachus munasqanmantapas runakunaman astawan yachachinaypaq."
"COVER SUBJECT" "QALLARIYPI KAQ"
"Scenario 1: Isabel’s * parents have come for a visit." "Isabelpa * tayta - mamanmi qatayninta watukuq rinku."
"They share an enjoyable evening with their daughter and her husband, marked by pleasant conversation." "Chay ch’isin sumaqta rimanku."
"What parent would not beam with pride at the man their daughter married? He is so kind to her." "Isabelpa tayta - mamanqa anchatan kusikun ususinku chhayna qosayoq kasqanmanta."
"Scenario 2: Frank is boiling with rage." "¡Ancha munasqan ususinqa kasqa!"
"Once again, he will take out his anger in typical fashion ​ — which for him means hitting his wife in the face, kicking her, pulling her hair, or repeatedly knocking her head against the wall." "Frankqa sinchi phiñasqan kashan, sapa chhayna kaspanmi esposanpi samarikun, chaymi kay kutipipas hayt’an, saqman, chukchanmanta chutaspataq askha kutita perqaman umanta q’asun."
"IT MIGHT surprise you to learn that both of those scenarios are about the same couple." "ADMIRAKUNKIÑA chaypas ñawpaqpi leesqanchisqa Frankpa Isabelpa casarasqa kawsayninkun."
"Like many perpetrators of domestic violence, Frank knows how to put on a “good - guy ” pretense when he is in the public eye or with his wife’s parents." "Esposankuta maqaq askha qosakunan Frank hina kanku, runakunaq qhawarinanpaqmi allin runa kanku, suegronkuq ñawpaqenpipas."
"But when he is alone with his wife, Frank is terribly cruel." "Sapallankupi kaspan ichaqa esposankuta sinchita maqanku."
"Many men like Frank grew up in violent families, and as adults they think that their behavior is acceptable ​ — even normal." "Askha tayta - mamakunan wawankuq ñawpaqenpi maqanakunku, chhayna familiapin Frankpas wiñarqan, chaymi kurakña kaspanku chhaynapuni kawsay kananpaq yuyaykunku."
"But there is nothing normal about domestic violence. That is why most people are appalled when they learn that a man has battered his wife." "Ichaqa esposankuta maqaq qharikunamanta uyarispan askha runakuna ninku “imayna sonqoyoqtaq kanku chhaynata ruwanankupaqri ” nispa."
"Still, domestic violence is disturbingly common." "Chhayna kawsayqa tukuypin kashan."
"In the United States, for example, one survey found that during one day an average of over 16 calls per minute were directed to domestic - violence hotlines across the country." "Estados Unidospin huk minutopi chunka soqtayoq runakuna telefonopi waqyarqanku warmi - qhari maqanakuqkunata yanapaq oficinata."
"Domestic violence is a worldwide epidemic, crossing cultural, economic, and social groups." "Chayqa onqoy hinaraqmi pachantinpi mast’arikushan, wakchapas qhapaqpas chhayna kawsaypin tarikushanku."
"Since many incidents go unreported, no doubt the situation is worse than statistics reveal." "Ichaqa manan llapa maqachikuqkunachu denunciata churanku, paykunatawan yupaspaqa aswan askharaqmi kankuman."
* *
"Reports of domestic violence raise the questions: How can a man come to the point of treating anyone ​ — let alone his wife — ​ so outrageously?" "Noticiakunapiqa uyarishallanchismi warmi - qhari maqanakuykunamanta, chaymi kaykunata tapukunchis: “¿Imaynapitaq huk runari esposanta chhaynaniraqta maqanman?"
"Can men who batter their wives be helped?" "¿Ima yanapayllapas kanchu chhayna maqaq qosakunapaq? ”, nispa."
"Jehovah’s Witnesses, the publishers of this magazine, believe that the Bible’s practical advice can help violent spouses change their behavior. Is such a reversal easy? No. Is it possible?" "Kay revistata qelqamuq Jehová Diospa testigonkunaqa manan iskayyankuchu Bibliapi allin yuyaychaykuna kasqanmanta, chaypi yanapaykunaqa maqakuq qosakunatan llanp’u sonqoman tukuchin."
"Yes! Bible education has helped many to replace a violent disposition with one of kindness and respect." "Ñawpaqpin askha runakuna t’impuq sonqo karqanku ichaqa Bibliaq yanapayninwanmi sumaq sonqo respetakuq runa kapurqanku, sasaña karqan chaypas atirqankun."
"Consider the experience of Troy and Valerie." "Yachasun Tomasmanta Valeriamantawan."
"What was your relationship like at first?" "¿Imaynan karqan kawsayniykichis qallariypi?"
"Valerie: On the night of our engagement, Troy slapped me so hard that I had a bruise for a week." "Valeria: Kuska tiyanaykupaq rimanakusqayku tutapin Tomasqa ch’aqlawarqan, huk semanan q’oyo uyantin karqani."
"He apologized profusely and promised he would never do it again." "Chay qhepamanmi niwarqan manaña hayk’aqpas chhaynata ruwawananpaq."
"In the years to come, I would hear those words many times." "Ichaqa watan - watanmi chaytaqa niwashallarqan."
"Troy: Anything would set me off ​ — late meals, for instance." "Tomás: Imallamantapas k’araktan phiñakuq kani, mikhunata mana horasninpi chayachiqtinpas."
"Once I pistol - whipped Valerie." "Huk kutinmi pistolawan Valeriata q’asurqani."
"On another occasion, I beat her so badly that I thought I had killed her." "Huk kutinpipas chhaynatan q’asurqani chaymi wañurqonanpaq yuyaykurqani."
"Then, I tried to frighten her by threatening to kill our son while holding a knife to his throat." "Chaymantataqmi wawaykuq kunkanman huk cuchillota churaspay “wañurachisaqmi ” nispa manchachirqani."
"Valerie: I lived in constant fear." "Valeria: Manchasqallan kawsarqani."
"At times I had to flee the house until Troy calmed down." "Mayninpiqa wasiymantan ayqekuq kani Tomaspa sonqon tiyaykunankama."
"For all that, I found his verbal abuse even more difficult to endure than the physical violence." "Chaywanpas rimasqanmi astawanqa k’iriwaq maqawasqanmantaqa."
"Troy, had you always been violent?" "¿Chhaynapunichu karqanki Tomás?"
"Troy: Yes, from my childhood on. I grew up in a violent atmosphere." "Tomás: Arí, huch’uyniymantapachan chhayna karqani."
"My father regularly beat my mother in front of me and my siblings." "Taytayqa mamaytan maqaq wawqe - panaykunapas ñoqapas rikushaqtiyku."
"After he left, my mother took up with another man, and he also beat her." "Taytayqa saqepuwarqankun, mamayqa huk qhariwanmi tiyarqan ichaqa paypas maqallarqantaqmi."
"He also raped my sister ​ — and me." "Chaymantapas chay runan ñoqatapas panaytapas violawarqanku chaymi carcelman haykurqan."
"He went to prison for that. Of course, I realize that none of this excuses my behavior." "Ichaqa manan chay hawachu ninay “ñoqaqa chayraykun chhayna kani ” nispaqa."
"Valerie, you stayed in the marriage. Why?" "¿Imaraykun mana saqepurqankichu Valeria?"
"Valerie: I was afraid." "Valeria: Manchakurqanin."
"I thought to myself, ‘ What if he hunts me down and kills me or my parents?" "Kaykunapin yuyaykurqani: “Ripuqtiyqa maskhamuwanqapaschá hinaspa wañurqachiwanqa otaq tayta - mamaytapas wañurqachinqa."
"What if I report him and the situation gets worse? ’" "Denunciata churaqtiyqa aswan mana allinpipaschá rikukusaq ”, nispa."
"When did things begin to change?" "¿Hayk’aqmantapachan manaña maqanakuspachu kawsankichis?"
"Troy: My wife began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses." "Tomás: Esposaymi Jehová Diospa testigonkunawan Biblia estudiayta qallarirqan."
"At first, I was jealous of her new friends, and I thought I needed to save her from this strange “sect. ”" "Manan thakchu karqani chay runakunawan reqsinakushasqanmanta, chaymi yuyaykurqani chay “sectamanta ” lloqsipunanpaq."
"So I became even more violent, not only toward Valerie but also toward the Witnesses." "Hinan aswan millaytaraq Valeriata Testigokunatapas tratarqani."
"But one day our four - year - old son, Daniel, who suffered from seizures, was hospitalized for nearly three weeks." "Tawa watayoq Daniel churiymi ataque onqoyniyoq karqan hinan huk kutin kinsa semana hospitalman haykurqan."
"During that period, the Witnesses did so much for us ​ — even to the point of taking care of our six - year - old daughter, Desiree." "Chay kutipin Testigokunaqa imaymanapi yanapawarqanku, soqta watachayoq Teresa ususichaytapas cuidarqanku."
"After working the night shift, one Witness spent the day with Daniel so that Valerie could get some sleep." "Huk Testigon tutapi llank’asqan qhepaman Danielta ch’isiyaq cuidarqan chhaynapin Valeriaqa puñuq ripurqan."
"The kindness of those people ​ — the very people toward whom I had been so insolent — ​ affected me deeply." "Paykunataqa millaytan tratarqani ichaqa sumaq sonqo kasqankun sonqoyman chayarqan."
"I realized that I had seen true Christianity in action, so I asked the Witnesses if I could study the Bible with them." "Rikurqanin cheqaq cristianokuna imayna kasqankuta, chaymi Testigokunata valekurqani Bibliamanta yachachiwanankupaq."
"In the course of studying the Bible, I learned how a man should, and should not, treat his wife. I put away my violent and abusive behavior permanently." "Bibliata estudiasqaypin yacharqani esposanta huk qosa imayna munakunanta, hinan manaña k’arak sonqoñachu kapurqani."
"Eventually, I became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses." "Qhepamanqa bautizakapurqanin Jehová Diospa testigon kanaypaq."
"What Bible principles helped you to change?" "¿Bibliapi ima textokunan yanaparqasunki?"
"Troy: There are so many." "Tomás: Askha textokunan karqan."
"At 1 Peter 3: 7, the Bible says that I should show my wife “honor. ”" "1 Pedro 3: 7 textopin Biblia willan warmikunata ‘ sumaqta respetana ’ kasqanta."
"Galatians 5: 23 encourages “mildness ” and“ self - control. ”" "Gálatas 5: 23 texton nin ‘ llamp’u sonqo ’ “cuerpo kamachiq ” kanapaq."
"Ephesians 4: 31 condemns “abusive speech. ”" "Efesios 4: 31 textotaqmi huchachan rimasqanchiswan k’iriyta."
"Hebrews 4: 13 says that “all things are... openly exposed ” to God." "Hebreos 4: 13 texton willallantaq Diospa qayllanpiqa mana imapas “pakasqachu ” kasqanta."
"So God sees my conduct, even if my neighbors do not." "Diosqa tukuy ruwasqaytan rikushan manaña wasimasiykuna rikuwanchu chaypas."
"I also learned that I needed to change my associates, since “bad associations spoil useful habits. ”" "Hinaspapas wakin runakunawanqa manañan amigontinchu kanay karqan “mana allin runakunawan huñukuspaqa ” paykuna hinan kayman."
"You see, my former friends actually encouraged my violent ways." "Ñawpaqpi amigoykunaqa allinpaqmi qhawariqku k’arak phiñakuq kasqayta."
"They felt it was right to beat a woman to keep her “under control. ”" "Paykunaqa niqkun “warmitaqa maqaspallan purichina ” nispa."
"How do you feel about your marriage now?" "¿Imaynatan kunan kawsashankichis?"
"Valerie: It has been 25 years since Troy became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses." "Valeria: Tomasqa iskay chunka phisqayoq watañan Jehová Diospa testigon kashan."
"Since then, he has been genuinely loving, kind, and considerate toward me." "Chay kutimantapachan payqa munakuq sumaq sonqo runa kapurqan."
"Troy: I cannot change the evil that I brought on my family, and my wife certainly never deserved the treatment I gave her." "Tomás: Familiaypa sonqonta k’irisqaytaqa manañan allichayta atiymanñachu, sinchi millaytapunin esposaytaqa tratarqani."
"But I look forward to the fulfillment of Isaiah 65: 17, when this dark part of our history will fade from memory." "Maytan munashani Isaías 65: 17 textopi nisqan hunt’akunanta, manañan chay tiempopiqa yuyarisaqkuñachu chay mana chanin ruwasqaykunata."
"What advice would each of you give to families that are afflicted with domestic violence?" "¿Imatan niwaqchis maqanakuspa kawsaq warmi - qharikunata?"
"Troy: If you are physically or verbally violent toward your family, admit that you need help, and get it." "Tomás: Sichus pipas familianpi kaqkunata maqan otaq rimasqanwanpas k’irin chayqa reparakunanmi yanapana kasqanta."
"There is plenty of help available." "Maskhanki chayqa tarinkin."
"For me, studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses and associating with them helped me to overcome my deeply entrenched violent tendencies." "Ñoqataqa Testigokunawan Bibliata estudiasqaymi, paykunawan huñunakusqaymi yanapawarqan amaña k’arak sonqo kanaypaq."
"Valerie: Do not be quick to compare your situation with that of anyone else or to follow advice from people who think they know what is best for you." "Valeria: Imaynapi tarikusqaykitaqa ama hukkunaq kawsayninwan tupanachiychu, wakinkunaqa yachaqpaqmi qhawarikunku imachus allinniykipaq kananmanta, paykunaq nisqasuykikutaqa ama kasuychu."
"Although not everyone will have the same outcome, I am glad that I did not throw my marriage away, because we have been blessed with a good relationship now." "Manan llapa runaq sasachakuyninchu kaqllapi tukun, ichaqa warmi - qhari allinta kawsanaykupaq kallpachakusqaykuqa manan yanqachu karqan, kunanqa kusisqan kawsayku."
"A study of the Bible has helped many men to make needed changes The Bible states: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight. ”" "Biblian nin: “Diospa Simin Qelqakunaqa llapallanmi Diospa yuyaychasqan, chayraykun allinpuni yachachinapaq, anyanapaq, wanachinapaq ”, nispa."
"Like Troy, whose story is related above, many abusive spouses have applied the Bible’s counsel and have been able to change their thinking and conduct." "Tomasqa Bibliaq kamachikuyninkunatan kasukurqan chhaynapin manaña k’araq sonqoñachu kapurqan, pay hinan askha runakunapas mana allin kawsayninkuta saqepurqanku."
"Would you like to learn more about how the Bible can benefit your marriage? For further information contact Jehovah’s Witnesses locally, or log on to www.jw.org." "Casarasqakunata imaynata Biblia yanapasqanmanta astawan yachayta munanki chayqa Jehová Diospa testigonkunata maskhay otaq Internetpi maskhay www.jw.org / es nisqapi."
"Some names in this article have been changed." "Wakin sutikunan cambiakun."
"Admittedly, a considerable number of men are battered by women." "Esposankuwan maqachikuq qharikunapas kanmi."
"In most reported incidents of domestic violence, however, men are the perpetrators." "Ichaqa aswan askha denuncia churaqkunaqa qosankuwan maqachikuq warmikunan kanku."
"Why do some wives choose to remain with a violent mate?" "¿Imaraykun qosankuña maqashaqtinpas mana t’aqakunkuchu?"
"A common reason is that they fear the abuse will get worse if they leave." "Manchakunkun saqeqtinku astawan maqachikunankumanta."
"Some husbands have threatened to harm or even kill their wife if she tried to escape." "Askha qharikunan esposankuta amenazarqanku ripuqtinkuqa ima mana allintapas ruwanankupaq otaq wañuchinankupaqpas."
"A number have carried out that threat." "Askhataqmi chay rimasqankuta hunt’arqanku."
"Others have hesitated to leave because they fear that their friends and relatives would turn against them, refusing to believe that the situation at home was so severe." "Wakinqa manchakunkun ripuqtinkuqa amigonkunapas, familiankupas paykuna contra kapunankumanta, manataqmi reparankuchu wasinkupi kawsayninkuqa mana allin kasqanta."
"For example, Isabel, whose experience is referred to at the outset of this article, left her husband." "Qallariypi rimasqanchis Isabelqa qosanta saqespan ripurqan."
"She states: “My sister was angry with me and urged me to return to him ​ — she did not believe that such a ‘ good ’ man could be so cruel." "Paymi nin: “Ñañaymi ñoqapaq phiñakapurqan niwarqantaqmi kutinakunaypaq."
"The entire neighborhood shunned me, and I was forced to move away with my children. ”" "Paypaqqa qosayqa allin runan karqan chaymi mana creerqanchu millay kasqanta."
"Still other reasons why some wives choose to stay are:" "¿Imaraykun mana t’aqakullankutaqchu?"
"They want their children to grow up with both parents." "Munankun wawanku taytankuwan kuska wiñanankuta."
"They worry about being able to support themselves and their children financially." "Ninkun: “Manapaschá imayna kawsayta atisaqchu wawaykuna imayna uywaytapas ”, nispa."
"They erroneously believe that they are to blame." "Chhaynapi tarikusqankumantan paykuna huchachakunku."
"They are ashamed to admit that they are being abused." "Qosankuwan maqachikusqankumantan p’enqakunku willakuyta."
"They hope the situation will improve." "Ninkun: “Yaqapaschá hayk’aqllapas kayqa tukunqa ”, nispa."
"Jehovah’s Witnesses hold to the Bible standard that the only ground for divorce is adultery." "Jehová Diospa testigonkunaqa kasukunkun Bibliaq nisqanta, chaypin nin qosapas otaq esposapas hukwan pantallaqtin divorcio kananta."
"However, there are circumstances that might move some to separate, including the extreme conduct of a physically abusive mate." "Ichaqa qosa otaq esposa sinchita maqanman chayqa atinkumanmi wasinkumanta ripuyta otaq t’aqakuyta."
"Treat your wife with honor and respect. ​ — 1 Peter 3: 7." "Esposaykita sumaqta respetay"

"Think of the consequences of your actions. ​ — Galatians 6: 7." "Reparay ima ruwasqaykipas imayna tukunanpi"
"If you feel you are going to lose control, it may be best to walk away. ​ — Proverbs 17: 14." "Phiñakunaykipaq hina kasqaykita reparakuspaqa ayqerikuy (Proverbios 17: 14)"
"Learn to detest violent behavior. ​ — Psalm 11: 5." "Millay k’arak sonqo kayta cheqnikuy (Salmo 11: 5)"

"For example, if a parent has said that a certain misdeed would result in a particular consequence, a teenager might test the boundaries to see if the parent will follow through." "Sichus niwaq “mana kasuwankichu chayqa khaynapin tarikunki ” nispa chayqa, yaqapaschá wawaykiqa rimasqaykita hunt’ankichus icha manachus chayta yachananpaq mana kasusunkichu."
"Are such teenagers becoming hardened rebels?" "Chhaynaqa, ¿k’ullumanchu wawayki tukupushan?"

"The fact is, teens are more likely to be lax about obeying rules when parents have not been consistent in enforcing consequences or when the boundaries have not been clearly defined."

"So how can you teach your teenager to comply with your rules?" "¿Imaynatan wayna - sipasyashaq wawaykita yachachiwaq kamachisqaykita kasukunanpaq?"
"Be clear." "Sut’ita kamachiy."
"Teenagers need to know precisely what is expected of them and what the consequences of disobedience will be. ​ — Bible principle: Galatians 6: 7."

"Your goal is not just to get your teenager to obey orders but to help him develop a healthy conscience ​ — an internal sense of right and wrong.

"Ama kamachikuykuna kasukunallantachu wawaykitaqa yachachiy, aswanpas yanapallaytaq allin concienciayoq kananpaqpas (qhaway “Yanapay sumaq runa kananpaq ” nisqa recuadrota) (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: 1 Pedro 3: 16)."
"Suggestion: Look to the Bible for help." "Kaytan ruwawaq: Bibliapin aswan allin yachachikuykunaqa tarikun, chaypi maskhay yanapayta."
"It is the best source of “discipline that gives insight, ” and its wisdom can“ give to the inexperienced ones shrewdness, to a young man [or woman] knowledge and thinking ability. ” ​ — Proverbs 1: 1 - 4." "Chaypi yachachikuyninkunaqa ‘ warmakunatan yuyaysapaman tukuchin, waynakunatapas yuyaychaspan yuyayta hap’ichin ’ (Proverbios 1: 1 - 4)."

"When faced with a challenge, young people can learn to make good decisions by asking themselves the following questions:" "Ima sasachakuypipas tarikuspa allinta decidinankupaqqa kaykunatan wayna - sipaskunaqa tapukunkuman:"
"What kind of person do I want to be? ​ — Colossians 3: 10." "¿Imayna runa kaytan munayman?"

"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"“God is a Spirit. ” ​ — John 4: 24." "“Diosqa Espiritun ” (Juan 4: 24)"
"The Bible describes God as a spirit being." "Diosqa espiritun."
"As such, he is far superior to us and beyond our physical senses." "Chayraykun payqa ñoqanchismanta aswan atiyniyoq."
"He is “the King of eternity, incorruptible, invisible, ” says 1 Timothy 1: 17." "1 Timoteo 1: 17 texton willan Diosqa ‘ wiñay - wiñay Rey, mana wañuq, mana rikuna ’ kasqanta, paytaqa manapunin rikusunmanchu."
"The Bible also states: “At no time has anyone beheld God. ” ​ — 1 John 4: 12." "Chayraykun Bibliaqa nin: “Manan pipas Diostaqa hayk’aqpas rikurqanchu ”, nispa."
"Our Creator is so superior to us that we cannot even begin to imagine what he looks like." "Kamaqninchisqa ancha atiyniyoqpunin."
"“To whom can you people liken God, and what likeness can you put alongside him? ”" "Imayna rikch’ayniyoq kasqantaqa manan yuyaykuytapas atisunmanchu."
"says Isaiah 40: 18." "Isaías 40: 18 texton nin: “¿Imawantaq Diosta rikch’anachinkichis? ”, nispa."
"Even the awe - inspiring physical heavens pale in comparison with the Almighty. ​ — Isaiah 40: 22, 26." "Tukuy rikusqanchispas ancha munay kashaspa manan imapaschu paywan tupanachiqtinchisqa kanman (Isaías 40: 22, 26)."
"There are, however, intelligent creatures who can see God and even speak with him face - to - face. How so? Because they too are spirits, and they live in heaven." "Ichaqa kanmi Diosta rikuqkuna paywan uya - uyapura rimaqkunapas, paykunapas espiritullataqmi kanku hanaq pachapitaqmi kawsankupas (1 Reyes 22: 21; Hebreos 1: 7)."
"Concerning these superhuman creatures, who are also called angels, Jesus Christ said: “[They] always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven. ” ​ — Matthew 18: 10." "Paykunaqa angelkunan, Jesusmi nirqan: “Hanaq pachapi angelninkunaqa hanaq pachapi kaq Yayaypa uyanta qhawashankupunin ”, nispa."
"“You must pray, then, this way: ‘ Our Father in the heavens. ’ ” ​ — Matthew 6: 9." "“Qankunaqa kay hinata mañakuychis: Yayayku hanaq pachapi kaq ” (Mateo 6: 9)"
"The Bible does not teach that God is omnipresent, or present everywhere at all times, like some impersonal force." "Diosqa manan tukuy ladopichu kashan imaynan wayraqa tukuy ladopi kashan hinaqa."
"Rather, as Jesus ’ words found at Matthew 6: 9 and 18: 10 show, God is a person ​ — a “Father ” — ​ and he resides in heaven, his“ established place of dwelling. ” ​ — 1 Kings 8: 43." "Mateo 6: 9; 18: 10 textokunapin Jesús nirqan Diosqa huk Tayta kasqanta maypi tiyasqanpas ‘ hanaq pacha ’ kasqanta (1 Reyes 8: 43)."
"Toward the end of his life, Jesus said: “I am leaving the world and am going my way to the Father. ”" "Kay pachapi pisillaña kawsananpaq kashaqtinmi Jesús nirqan: ‘ Kay pachata saqespan Yayaman ripushani ’, nispa."
"After his death in the flesh and resurrection as a spirit, Christ ascended “into heaven itself, now to appear before the person of God. ” ​ — Hebrews 9: 24." "Wañusqan qhepamanqa espíritu cuerpopin kawsarimpurqan, hinan hanaq pachaman ripuspa ‘ Diospa qayllanman ’ haykurqan."
"These facts about God matter. Why? For one thing, because God is a person, we can learn about him and draw close to him." "Chayta yachaspan reparanchis Diosman asuykuy atisqanchista payta reqsiy atisqanchistapas."
"For another, the truth about God protects us from false worship, such as the worship of lifeless images and objects." "Hinaspapas Diosmanta cheqaqta yachasqanchismi yanapawanchis yanqa kaqkunata mana yupaychanapaq."
"“Little children, guard yourselves from idols, ” says 1 John 5: 21." "1 Juan 5: 21 textopin niwanchis: “Wawallaykuna, idolokunataqa amapuni yupaychaychischu ”, nispa."
"“God proceeded to create the man in his image, in God’s image he created him; male and female he created them. ” ​ — Genesis 1: 27." "“Diosqa runata kamarqan, Diosman rikch’akuqtan paytaqa kamarqan, qharita warmitawanmi kamarqan ” (Génesis 1: 27)"
"As humans, we have the potential to reflect God’s personality traits, such as his love, justice, and wisdom." "Diosqa munakuqmi, chaninmi, yachayniyoqmi, runakunapas chaykunapiqa pay hina kaytan atinchis."
"In fact, the Bible says: “Become imitators of God, as beloved children, and go on walking in love. ” ​ — Ephesians 5: 1, 2." "Chayraykun Biblia niwanchis: “Diospa munasqa wawankunan kankichis, chayrayku payman rikch’akuq kaychis. Munanakuypi kawsaychis ”, nispa."
"God also made us free moral agents, which enables us to choose right over wrong and to express love for others in a variety of ways." "Hinaspapas Diosqa kamawarqanchismi kikillanchismanta decidinapaq, chaymi atinchis allinkaqta ruwanapaq akllakuyta, atillanchistaqmi runamasinchis munakuytapas."
"We also have the ability to be creative, to enjoy beauty, and to stand in awe at the amazing world around us." "Hinaspapas yuyayniyoqtan kamawarqanchis imaymanakunata ruwanapaq, kusikunchistaqmi kay pachapi imaymana kamasqakunata qhawaspapas."
"Above all, we have received a spiritual capacity, a natural desire to learn about our Creator and his will for us. ​ — Matthew 5: 3." "Chaymantapas runakunaqa yachaytan munanchis Diosmanta munayninmantapas, chhaynatan Diosqa kamawarqanchis."
"How Bible truth can help you." "¿Imaynatan yanapawanchis Bibliamanta cheqaqta yachay?"
"The more we learn about God and imitate him, the more we live the way he intended us to live." "Sichus Diosta astawan reqsisun pay hinataq kasun chayqa, astawanmi munasun paypa munasqanman hina kawsayta."
"As a result, we experience more joy in life, along with genuine satisfaction, inner peace, and contentment." "Chayta ruwayqa kusichiwasunmi thakpitaqmi kawsasun (Isaías 48: 17, 18)."
"Yes, God knows that his endearing qualities resonate in the human heart, drawing honesthearted people to him and setting them on the path to everlasting life. ​ — John 6: 44; 17: 3." "Hinaspapas, sichus Diosta reqsiyta munaspapuni payman asuykusunchis chayqa, wiñay kawsayman apaq ñantan tarisunchis."
"HELP FOR THE FAMILY | MARRIAGE" "FAMILIAKUNAPAQ YANAPAYKUNA | CASARASQAKUNAPAQ"
"How do two people who have vowed to love each other get to the point where they refuse to talk for hours ​ — or even days?" "¿Imaynapin tukuy tiempo munanakunankupaq prometekuq runakuna askha horakuna otaq askha p’unchaykuna mana rimanaykuspa kankuman?"
"‘ At least we stopped fighting, ’ they tell themselves." "Yaqapaschá ninku “chhaynapin manaña maqanakuykuchu ” nispa."
"Still, the issue has not been resolved, and they both feel uncomfortable." "Ichaqa manan chaywanchu sasachakuyninkuqa allichakun, chhaynata kawsaspaqa manan thakchu kanku."
Retaliation. "Vengakuyta munaspa."
"Some spouses use silence as a form of revenge." "Wakinqa qosankumanta otaq esposankumanta vengakuyta munaspan mana rimayunkuchu."
"For example, suppose a husband makes weekend plans without consulting his wife." "Kaymi pasanman: Qosan tukukuy semanapi ima ruwanankuta decidin esposanta mana tapuykuspa."
"When she finds out, she is angry and calls him inconsiderate. He responds by calling her oversensitive." "Chayta yacharqospan esposanqa sinchita phiñakuspa nin “maypi mana ñoqata tapuwaspayki chayta decidiwaq ” nispa, qosataq nin“ chayllawanchu phiñakunki ” nispa."
"The wife storms off and stews in silence." "Esposanqa sinchi phiñasqan ladonmanta pasapun, manañataq rimaypunñachu."
"In effect, she is saying, “You hurt me, so I am going to hurt you back. ”" "Chayta ruwaspaqa kaytapas nishanman hinan: “Qanqa sonqoytan k’irirqowanki, kunanqa ñoqamanñataqmi tupawan ”, nispa."
Manipulation. "Munasqanta tarinanrayku."
"Some use the silent treatment as a means to get what they want." "Wakinqa imachus munasqankuta tarinankupaqmi chayta ruwanku."
"For example, imagine that a husband and wife plan a trip and the wife would like to take her parents along." "Kaymi kanman: Casarasqa warmi - qharin paseakuq riyta munanku, chaymi warmi nin tayta - mamantawan pusay munasqanta."
"The husband objects. “You’re married to me, not to your parents, ” he says." "Qharitaq mana munanchu hinaspa nin “qanwanmi casarasqaqa kashani manan tayta - mamaykiwanchu ” nispa."
"He then gives his wife the silent treatment, shunning her in the hope that she will break down and concede to his wishes." "Chaymi qosanqa mana rimaypunchu chhaynapi munasqanta ruwananpaq."
"Of course, a temporary time - out can give a couple the opportunity to let emotions cool when an argument is getting out of hand." "Sinchi phiñachinakuy kaqtinqa allinpunin upallalla kayqa chhaynapi manaña k’aminakunapaq, chayqa sonqoq tiyaykunanpaqmi."
"That type of silence can be beneficial. The Bible says that there is “a time to keep quiet. ”" "Biblian nin: “Kanmi upallakuna tiempo ”, nispa (Eclesiastés 3: 7)."
"But when it is used as a means to retaliate or manipulate, the silent treatment not only prolongs conflict but also erodes the respect the couple have for each other." "Ichaqa vengakunapaq otaq ima munasqankuta tarinankupaq mana rimanaykuyqa manan allichanqachu sasachakuykunata, respetanakuypas pisiyapunqan."
"How can you prevent that from happening to you?" "¿Imatan ruwawaqchis chhaynapi ama tarikunaykichispaq?"
"The first step to ending the silent treatment is to recognize it for what it is ​ — a tactic that, at best, works only short - term." "Mana rimayusqaykirayku imapas allichakusqanqa manan unaypaqchu kanqa, chaytaqa allintan yachanayki."
"True, not talking may quench your thirst for retaliation or compel your spouse to give in to your wishes." "Yaqapaschá chayta ruwaspa vengakurqanki otaq munasqaykita tarirqanki ichaqa, ¿chaytachu ruwanayki munakunaykipaq prometesqayki runata?"
"But is that really how you want to treat someone whom you have vowed to love?" "Sasachakuykunataqa atikunmi hukniraymanta allichakuyta."
"There are better ways to resolve conflicts." "Allinta reparay imatachus niyta munasqanta."
"Be discerning. The Bible says that love “does not become provoked. ”" "Biblian nin munakuqqa “manan phiñakunpachachu ” nispa."
"So don’t overreact to such emotionally charged statements as “You never listen ” or“ You are always late. ”" "Sichus phiñasqa esposayki otaq qosayki nisunki “manan hayk’aqas uyariwankichu ” otaq“ sapa kutillanmi tardeta chayamunki ” nispa chayqa, ama phiñakuypachachu."
"Instead, discern the intent behind the words." "Aswanpas allinta reparay imatapunichus niy munasqanta."
"For instance, “You never listen ” might really mean“ I feel as if you don’t take my viewpoint seriously. ” ​ — Bible principle: Proverbs 14: 29." "Yaqapaschá “manan hayk’aqpas uyariwankichu ” nispanqa“ ñoqaq nisqaytaqa manachus hina cuentapaqpas churankichu ” nishan (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Proverbios 14: 29)."
"Think of your spouse as your teammate rather than an opponent" "Esposaykita otaq qosaykita qhawariy yanapaqmasiykita hina amataq enemigoykita hinachu"
"Lower your voice." "Ama alto kunkawan rimaychu."
"Arguments tend to escalate as they continue." "Unayta k’aminakuspaqa astawanmi phiñachinakunkichis."
"On the other hand, you can change the direction of a heated discussion." "¿Imatan ruwawaq chhaynapi ama tarikunaykipaq?"
"How? The book Fighting for Your Marriage says: “Softening your tone and acknowledging your partner’s point of view are potent tools you can employ to diffuse tension and end escalation." "Huk libron nin: “Phiñachinakuy pisiyananpaqqa ama alto kunkawanchu rimay esposaykiq otaq qosaykiq nisqantataq uyariy."
"Often that’s all it takes. ” ​ — Bible principle: Proverbs 26: 20." "Mayninpiqa chayllapaqmi kanqa ”, nispa (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Proverbios 26: 20)."
"Think of “we ” instead of“ me. ”" "Ama qanllapichu yuyaykuy."
"The Bible says: “Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person. ”" "Biblian nin: “Ama pipas kikinpa allinnillantaqa maskhachunchu, aswanpas runamasinpa allinninta maskhachun ”, nispa."
"If you think of your spouse as your teammate rather than your opponent, you will be less likely to take offense, argue, and then refuse to talk to your spouse. ​ — Bible principle: Ecclesiastes 7: 9." "Sichus esposaykita otaq qosaykita qhawarinki yanapaqmasiykita hina manataq enemigoykita hinachu chayqa manan usqhayllachu phiñakunki manataqmi mana rimanaykuspachu kanki (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Eclesiastés 7: 9)."
"The silent treatment runs counter to the Bible’s admonition: “Let each one of you individually so love his wife as he does himself; on the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband. ”" "Biblian nin: “Sapankaykichis qankuna kikiykichista hinapuni esposaykichista munakuychis, hinallataq qankunapas esposakuna qosaykichista respetaychis ”, nispa."
"Why not make an agreement with your spouse that the silent treatment is unacceptable in your marriage?" "Mana rimanaykuspaqa chay nisqantan mana hunt’ashankichischu. Chhaynaqa, casarasqa warmi - qharikuna decidiychis ama hayk’aqpas mana rimanaykuspa kanaykichispaq."
"“He that is slow to anger is abundant in discernment. ” ​ — Proverbs 14: 29." "“Mana usqhay phiñakuqqa allin yuyayniyoqmi ” (Proverbios 14: 29)"
"“Where there is no wood the fire goes out. ” ​ — Proverbs 26: 20." "“Mana llant’awanqa ninaqa wañunmi ” (Proverbios 26: 20)"
"“Do not hurry yourself in your spirit to become offended. ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 7: 9." "“Ama sonqoykipi usqhaylla phiñakuychu ” (Eclesiastés 7: 9)"
"The Bible states: “Let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one. ”" "Biblian nin: “Rimakuyniykichisqa ancha sumaqpuni kachun, kachiwan kachichasqa hina, ahinapin yachankichis imaynatachus sapankamanpas allinta kutichinaykichista ”, nispa."
"This certainly applies in marriage!" "Kay yuyaychayqa astawanqa casarasqakunapaqmi."
"To illustrate: In a game of catch, you toss the ball so that it can be caught easily. You do not fling it with such force that you injure your partner." "Kaywan rikch’anachisun: Pelotawan pukllaspaqa sumaqllatan pasananchis hukkaq runa mana sasachakuspalla hap’inanpaq."
"Apply the same principle when speaking with your spouse." "Manan tukuy kallpawanchu ch’aqenanchis mana hinaqa k’irisunmanmi."
"Hurling bitter remarks will only cause harm." "Chhaynallatataq qosaykiwan otaq esposaykiwanpas rimay."
"Instead, speak gently ​ — with graciousness — ​ so that your mate can catch your point. ​ — From Awake!" "Rimasqaykiwan pelotawan hina kallpawan ch’aqespaqa k’irinkin."

"Hawampi kaqqa wakillanmi, 1500 watakunapin España nacionmanta runakuna chay documentota apaykuspa América hallp’aman chayamurqanku chay hallp’akunata hap’ikapunankupaq."
"What exactly did the conquistadores proclaim to the local people, and why?" "Chay documentota leespa, ¿imatan chaypi tiyaqkunata nisharqanku, imaraykun leeqkupuni?"
"Soon after Columbus set foot in the Americas in 1492, Spain and Portugal each claimed sovereignty over the new lands." "1492 watapi Cristobal Colón América hallp’aman chayasqan qhepallamanmi España, Portugal nacionkuna kamachiyta munarqanku tarimusqanku hallp’akunata."
"Since both nations considered the pope to be Christ’s representative on earth, they called on him to settle their dispute." "Iskayninkupaqmi Papaqa Cristoq rantinpi churasqa karqan, chaymi allichananta munarqanku."
"Under the pope’s direction, the church apportioned the newly found lands between Spain and Portugal ​ — on the condition that these two countries send missionaries to convert the natives. As the conquest progressed, the Spanish monarchy sought to legitimize the exploits of the conquistadores." "Papaq kamachisqanman hinan católica Iglesiaqa hallp’akunata iskaynin nacionkunaman rakirqan, ichaqa misionerokunatan kachananku karqan chaypi tiyaq runakunata católica religionman tukuchipunankupaq."
"The Spanish asserted that since the pope was acting in God’s behalf when he granted the lands to them, the conquistadores were free to dispose of the indigenous people and their goods and curtail their liberty. The Spanish drafted a document to inform the local inhabitants of the pope’s decision." "Chay tarimusqanku hallp’akunapi tiyaq runakunawanqa imaymanatan España nacionmanta runakuna ruwarqanku, chaykunamanta mana huchachasqa kanankupaqtaqmi España reyqa nirqan Diospa sutinpi chay hallp’akunata Papa qosqanta, chayraykus ima munasqankutapas ruwayta atisqaku."

"However, it did little to promote the religion of the Spanish. Sixteenth - century missionary friar Bartolomé de las Casas, an eyewitness to the Requirement’s effects, wrote: “How unjust, impious, scandalous, irrational and absurd this injunction was!" "Yaqapaschá chay documentoq leekusqanqa hallp’ata dueñochakuqkunaq sonqonkuta thak niyachirqan, ichaqa religionninkun mana allinpi qheparqan. 1500 watakunapin fray Bartolomé de las Casas misionero rikurqan imakunatachus chay documentota utilizaspa ruwasqankuta, paymi qelqarqan: “Sinchi mana chanin, mana khuyapayakuq, p’enqayta ruway, mana yuyayniyoqpa ruwasqan hinapunin karqan chay documentopi nisqanqa."

"Is God to blame for such atrocities committed by political and ecclesiastical powers, purportedly in his name?" "España nacionpi kamachikuqkunapas Iglesia catolicapas Diospa sutinpin chay mana chaninkunata ruwarqanku. Ichaqa, ¿Diostachu tumpasunman chay ruwasqankumanta?"
"The Bible states: “Far be it from the true God to act wickedly, and the Almighty to act unjustly! ” ​ — Job 34: 10." "Biblian nin: “¡Diosqa manan hayk’aqpas mana allintaqa ruwanmanchu! ¡Tukuy - atiyniyoqqa manan hayk’aqpas mana chanintaqa ruwanmanchu! ”, nispa (Job 34: 10)."
"According to some sources, the Requirement was abolished in 1573." "Wakin qelqakunaq nisqanman hinaqa 1573 watapin chay documentoq nisqanqa manaña valepurqanñachu."

"The Requirement was an ultimatum delivered by Spanish conquistadores when they arrived in the Americas during the 16th century." "1500 watakunapin España nacionmanta runakuna América hallp’api tiyaq runakunaman chay documentota leeqku."
"Indigenous people were “required ” to acknowledge the authority of the Catholic Church." "Chay llaqtayoq runakunan católica religionmanta kapunanku karqan."
"The text of the ultimatum was read aloud in Spanish or Latin to local people who did not understand either language." "Chay documentotaqa alto kunkawanmi leekurqan castellano simipi otaq latín simipi, chay simikunataqa manan entiendeqkuchu América llaqtayoq runakunaqa."

"THE adult humpback whale is bigger and heavier than a city bus. Still, this colossal mammal is remarkably agile when diving and turning." "QHOPO wasa ballenaqa hatunña kaspaqa aswan hatun carroq sayaynin hinan chay carro hinataqmi llasanpas, chhaynaña kaqtinpas kay hatunkaray animalqa ratullan unu ukhuman chinkaykun ratullataq unupipas muyurin."
"How can the humpback whale be so nimble?" "¿Imaynatan chay ruwayta atin?"
"Part of the secret lies in the bumps on its flippers." "Chaypaqqa raphrankunawanmi yanapachikun."
"Consider: Most whales and other cetaceans have flippers with smooth leading edges." "Kaypi yuyaykuy: Yaqa llapa ballenakunaq raphranpa patanqa llusp’an qhopo wasa ballenaqmi ichaqa moqo - moqo."
"However, the humpback whale is different." "Chay moqokunan unuta wachu - wachuta t’aqaspa muyuchin."
"The bumps channel the water flow and create turbulence. This “tubercle effect ” provides the whale with more lift, allowing it to tilt its flippers at a high angle without stalling." "Chay unuq muyusqanwanmi ballenaqa aswan kallpawan phawan, chhaynapitaqmi raphrankunatapas astawanraq kuyuykachachiyta atin mana unuwan hark’achikuspalla."
"At high angles these bumps also reduce drag ​ — an important benefit for the humpback’s long flippers, each being about one third of the whale’s body length." "Raphrankuna hatunña chaypas chay moqo - moqonkunan yanapan unuwan mana hark’achikuspalla kuyuykachachinanpaq."

"Did the flipper of the humpback whale come about by evolution? Or was it designed?" "¿Kikillanmantachu qhopo wasa ballenaq raphran rikhurimurqan icha kamasqachu karqan?"
"Jehovah’s Witnesses, the publishers of this magazine, are politically neutral." "Rikch’ariy revistata qelqamuq Jehová Diospa testigonkunaqa manan politicaman chhaqrukunkuchu."
"Thus, while the following article reports on specific examples of civil unrest, it does not endorse one nation over another or take sides on any political issue." "Qatiqninpiña qelqanku runakunaq hatarisqankumanta chaypas, manan mayqen naciontapas, politicatapas yanapankuchu."
"ON December 17, 2010, Mohamed Bouazizi reached his limit. He was a 26 - year - old street vendor in Tunisia who was frustrated with being unable to find a better job. He was also aware of corrupt officials ’ demands for bribes." "TÚNEZ llaqtamanta fruta vendeq 26 watayoq Mohamed Bouazizi waynan, 2010 watapi 17 diciembre killapi sinchi llakisqa karqan aswan allin llank’anata mana tarisqanrayku, mana allin policiakunaq sapa kutillan qolqe mañasqankuwanpas."
"On that particular morning, inspectors confiscated Mohamed’s supply of pears, bananas, and apples." "Chay tutamantanmi qechurqanku pera, manzana, plátano cajonninkunata."
"When they took his scales, he resisted; and some witnesses say that a female police officer slapped him." "Romananta qechuqtinku mana kacharikuqtintaq huk warmi policía ch’aqlarqan."

"After dousing himself with a flammable liquid, he struck a match." "Hinan gasolinawan hich’aykukuspa kanakurqan."
"He died of his burns less than three weeks later." "Kinsa semanamantaq wañupurqan."
"Mohamed Bouazizi’s desperate act resonated with people in Tunisia and beyond." "Mohamedpa ruwasqanqa askha runakunaq sonqonmanmi chayarqan."
"Many consider his actions the trigger for an uprising that toppled the country’s regime and protests that soon spread to other Arab countries." "Askhan ninku Túnez llaqtapi wak nacionkunapipas gobierno contra runakunaq hatarisqanqa paypa wañusqanwan qallarisqanta."
"The European Parliament awarded Bouazizi and four others the 2011 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and The Times of London named him its 2011 person of the year."

"But what is behind the recent wave of protests?" "Ichaqa, ¿imanaqtinmi kay watakunapi gobiernokuna contra runakuna hatarin?"
"And are there any alternatives?" "¿Imaynatan runakunaq sasachakuynin allichakunman?"
"Many protests are ignited by the following:" "Wakinmi kaykuna:"
"Dissatisfaction with social systems." "Mana allinta kamachiqtinku."
"When people believe that the local government and economy serve their needs, there is little desire to protest ​ — people work within the existing order to address their problems." "Sichus gobierno allinninkupaq ruwamun, qolqepas mana pisinchu chayqa manan hatarinkuchu. Ima sasachakuy kaqtinpas leykunaq nisqanman hinan allichanku."
"On the other hand, when people feel that these systems are corrupt and unjust and rigged in favor of a select few, conditions are ripe for social unrest." "Mana allinta kamachispa pisi runakunallapaq allinta ruwaqtinkun ichaqa gobierno contra hatarinku."
"A trigger." "Sonqonkuman chayaqta hina ruwaqtinku."
"Often, an event moves people to action, to change from resignation to a belief that they must do something." "Mayninpiqa imapas pasaqtinmi runakunaqa hatarinku."
"Mohamed Bouazizi’s case, for example, set off mass protests in Tunisia." "Mohamed wañuchikusqanwanmi Túnez llaqtapi runakuna hatarirqanku."
"In India, a hunger strike against corruption by activist Anna Hazare set off protests by his supporters in 450 cities and towns." "India nacionpitaq autoridadkunaq mana allin ruwasqankurayku Anna Hazareq huelga de hambre nisqata ruwarqan, payta yanapanankupaqmi 450 llaqtakunapi runakuna hatarirqanku."
"As the Bible long ago acknowledged, we live in “a world where some people have power and others have to suffer under them. ”" "Bibliaq nisqan hina ‘ runaqa runamasinta mana allinta ruwananpaqmi munaychakun ’, chhayna tiempopin kawsashanchis (Eclesiastés 8: 9)."
"Corruption and injustice are even more widespread today than they were back then. Indeed, people are more aware than ever before of how political and economic systems have failed them." "Kay p’unchaykunapiqa astawanmi mana chanin kawsay kashan, runakunataq sut’ita reparanku runaq gobiernon mana allin kasqanta."
"Smartphones, the Internet, and 24 - hour news broadcasts now allow events even in isolated places to trigger a response over a large area." "Karu llaqtakunapi imakunapas pasasqanqa ratollan pachantinpi yachakun internet, televisión otaq celularkuna kasqanrayku."
"Proponents of social unrest would claim that protests have accomplished the following:" "Runakunaq hatarisqanta defendeqkunan ninku kaykuna tarisqankuta:"
"Provided relief for the poor." "Wakchakunatan yanaparqan."
"In response to so - called rent riots in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A., that occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930 ’ s, city officials suspended evictions and arranged for some of the rioters to get work." "Estados Unidos nacionpi, Chicago llaqtapi llank’ana mana tarikusqan tiempopin inquilinokuna hatarirqanku, chayraykun autoridadkuna manaña wikch’urqankuchu tiyasqanku wasimanta, wakinmantaq llank’anata qorqanku."
"Similar protests in New York City restored 77,000 evicted families to their homes. Addressed injustices." "Nueva York llaqtapipas runakunaq hatarisqanwanmi 77.000 familiakunan kutipurqanku wikch’uchikusqanku wasiman."
"Ultimately, the 1955 / 1956 boycott of city buses in Montgomery, Alabama, U.S.A., led to the overturning of laws for segregated seating in buses." "Mana chanin ruwaykunata allicharqanku. 1955 - 1956 watakunapin Estados Unidospi Montgomery, Alabama llaqtapi askha runakuna carrokunaman mana seqapurqankuchu, chay ruwasqankuwanmi huk raza runakunata yanaparqanku chay carrokunapi manaña millayta tratanankupaq."
"Stopped construction projects." "Empresakuna kanantan tatichirqankun."
"In December 2011, tens of thousands of people protested the construction of a coal - fired power plant near Hong Kong because of concerns about pollution, so the project was canceled."

"Although some protesters may accomplish their aims, God’s Kingdom offers a better solution" "Wakin sayariqkunaqa munasqankutan chaskirqanku, chaywanpas Diospa Gobiernonmi lliw sasachakuyta allichanqa"
"Of course, protesters do not always get what they want. For example, leaders may crack down rather than give in to demands." "Mayninpin ichaqa mana kasuchikunkuchu, wakin gobiernokunaqa manan qonkuchu mañakusqankuta."
"Recently, the president of one Middle Eastern country stated regarding the protest movement there: “It must be hit with an iron fist, ” and thousands have died in that uprising." "Qaynallan Asia, África (Oriente Medio) ladopi huk nacionpi gobierno nirqan, kamachikuynin contra hatariqkunata maski wañuchispapas upallachinankupaq."
"Even when protesters accomplish their aims, the aftermath invariably brings new problems." "Askha runan chay kutipi wañurqanku. Munasqankutaña tarinku chaypas huk sasachakuykunañataqmi paqarin."
"A man who helped depose the ruler of an African country told Time magazine about the new regime: “It was utopia that immediately descended into chaos. ”" "África nacionmanta huk gobiernota qarqoypi yanapakuq runan, huk revistaman nirqan: “Munasqaykuta tarisqayku qhepamanmi aswan mana allinpiraq tarikapurqayku ”, nispa."
"Many well - known people have felt that protesting oppressive systems is a moral imperative." "Askha runakunan ninku imapas mana allin kaqtinqa gobierno contra hatarinapuni kasqanta."
"For instance, the late Václav Havel, a former Czech president who spent years in prison for his human rights activities, wrote in 1985: “[The dissident] can offer, if anything, only his own skin ​ — and he offers it solely because he has no other way of affirming the truth he stands for. ”" "República Checa nacionmanta wañuq Václav Havel expresidenten, askha kutipi carcelpi karqan runakunaq derechonta defiendesqanrayku, paymi 1985 watapi qelqarqan: “Gobierno contra hatariqqa, kawsaynillantan qoyta atin chhaynallapin yuyaykusqanta llapa runawan uyarichikun ”, nispa."

"Describing the feelings behind such extreme actions, one man told Newsweek magazine: “We don’t have guns. We don’t want to harm other human beings. What else can people do? ”" "Huk runan chhayna ruwasqankumanta huk revistaman nirqan: “Manan armaykupas kanchu nitaqmi runakunatapas k’iriyta munaykuchu, chaymi wañuchikullaykuña ”, nispa."
"The Bible offers a solution to injustice, corruption, and oppression." "Bibliapin willan mana chanin ruwaykunata imayna allichakunanta."
"It describes a government that God has set up in heaven that will replace the failed political and economic systems that lead to protest." "Hanaq pachapi huk Gobiernota Dios churasqanmantan riman, chaymi tukuchinqa kay pachapi gobiernokunata chhaynapin runakuna manaña hatarinqakuchu."
"A prophecy about the Ruler of this government says: “He will deliver the poor one crying for help, also the afflicted one and whoever has no helper." "Diospa Gobiernopi kamachikuqmantan willakurqanña: ‘ Wakchatan qespichinqa, mana pi yanapayniyoq muchuqtan amachanqa."
"From oppression and from violence he will redeem their soul. ” ​ — Psalm 72: 12, 14." "Ñak’arichiymantan, sarunchaymantan paykunataqa qespichinqa ’, nispa (Salmo 72: 12, 14)."
"Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that God’s Kingdom is mankind’s only true hope for a peaceful world." "Jehová Diospa testigonkunaqa manan iskayankuchu Diospa Gobiernollan runakunapaq thak kay apamunanmanta."
"Thus, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not engage in protests." "Chaymi gobierno contra hatariykunapi mana yanapakunkuchu."
"But is the idea that a government by God could eliminate the reasons for protest unrealistic?" "¿Cheqaqtachu Dios tukuchinqa mana allin gobiernokunata?"
"It might seem to be." "Arí, askha runakunan chaypi confianku."
"Yet, many have developed confidence in God’s rulership. Why not look into it for yourself?" "Iskayashanki chayqa, qan kikiykipuni yachay imayna chaykuna kananmanta."

"The Catholic minority felt discriminated against by the majority Protestant establishment, accusing them of gerrymandering, heavy - handed policing, and employment blacklisting, as well as unfair housing practices." "Chay llaqtapiqa autoridadkunapas yaqa llapankun protestante karqanku, chaymi católico kaqkuna gobiernota tumpaqku: “Llank’anata wasitan mana qowankuchu, autoridadkuna akllaypin mana allinta ruwanku, policiakunaq mana allin ruwasqantan mana allichankuchu ”, nispa."
"I saw injustice and inequality everywhere I looked." "Mana chaninkunallatan rikurqani."

"I put up banned flags and scrawled anti - British graffiti everywhere I could." "Mana churana banderakunatan churarqani, Gran Bretaña contrataq may atisqaypi pinturawan qelqarqani."
"It seemed there was always another atrocity or murder of a Catholic to protest." "Imallapas kaqpunin hatarinapaq, mayninpiqa huk catolicota wañuchisqankurayku otaq ima millay ruwasqankuraykupas."
"What began as a parade or march often escalated into a full - scale riot." "Sapa kutillanmi huelga ruwasqaykuqa ch’aqwapi tukuq."
"While at the university, I joined student protests for the environment." "Universidadpin yanapakurqani kay pachata mana qhellichanankupaq estudiantekunaq hatarisqankupi."
"I later moved to London, and there I took part in socialist marches against government policies that seemed to benefit the upper classes at the expense of the poor." "Chaymantataq Londres llaqtaman astakurqani, chaypin puriysikurqani gobierno contra hatariqkunawan, wakchakunamanta qhechusparaq qhapaqkunata gobiernoq yanapasqanrayku."

"Eventually, though, I became disillusioned. Rather than achieving our goals, protests often stoked the fires of hate." "Tiempowanmi ichaqa sinchi llakisqa tarikapurqani, gobierno contra hatarisqaykuqa cheqninakuyllatan paqarichirqan."
"Despite noble intentions, humans cannot bring about justice and equality" "Anchataña runa kallpachakun mana chanin ruwaykunata tukunanpaq chaypas, manan atinchu"
"It was about this time that a friend introduced me to Jehovah’s Witnesses." "Chay watakunapi hinan huk amigoy willawarqan Testigonkunamanta."
"They taught me from the Bible that God cares about our suffering and that he will undo all the harm ever caused by humans." "Paykunan Bibliapi rikuchiwarqanku ñak’arisqanchismanta Diospa sonqon nanasqanta, runaq waqllichisqan pachatapas allichananta (Isaías 65: 17; Apocalipsis 21: 3, 4)."
"Despite noble intentions, humans cannot bring about justice and equality." "Anchataña runa kallpachakun mana chaninkunata tukunanpaq chaypas, manan atinchu."
"Not only do we need God’s direction but we also need his power to overcome the unseen forces behind the world’s problems. ​ — Jeremiah 10: 23; Ephesians 6: 12."

"WHEN Harriet died in 2006, she was about 175 years old." "HARRIETMI 2006 watapi wañupurqan 175 watanpi."
"Of course, Harriet was not a human. She was a Galapagos tortoise, and she lived at a zoo in Australia." "Harrietqa Galápagos islamanta huk tortugan karqan, chay animalqa Australia zoologicopin tiyarqan."
"Compared with us, Harriet had a very long life. But in comparison with other living things, her life span was not extraordinary." "Kawsasqanchismantaqa aswantaraqmi kawsarqan ichaqa huk kawsaqkunamantaqa pisillatan kawsarqan."
"Consider some examples." "Wakinmanta yachasun."
"The freshwater pearl mussel, say researchers in Finland, may live for 200 years." "Perlakunata ruwaq ch’urun 200 watata kawsan, chaytan ninku Finlandia nacionmanta estudiaq runakuna."

"Various trees, such as the bristlecone pine, the giant sequoia, and some species of cypress and spruce, live for thousands of years." "Waranqa watakunata kawsaq sach’akunapas kanmi, wakinmi unayta kawsaq pino, hatunkaray secuoya, hukkunapas."
"Yet humans, who are generally considered to be at the apex of terrestrial life, do well to live for 80 or 90 years ​ — despite our sometimes extraordinary efforts to extend life!" "Runakunataqmi ichaqa 80 otaq 90 watakunallata kawsanchis, chay animalkunamanta sach’akunamanta aswan allinña kashaspapas."
"What do you think ​ — is eight decades or so the best we can hope for?" "¿Allinchu chhayna pisi tiempolla kawsasqanchis icha atisunmanraqchu aswan unay kawsayta?"
"Or is there the possibility that we can live much longer?" "Askha runan confianku cienciawan medicokunaq utilizanan imaymana maquinakunawan wiñaypaq wayna - sipaslla kawsayta tarinankupi."
"Many people hope that science and medical technology hold the key. Science has contributed much to the fields of health and medical technology." "Cienciaqa anchatapunin yanapakushan saludninchis allin kananpaq, medicokunaq imaymana maquinakuna utilizasqanta horqomuspanku."
"“Fewer people [in the United States] die from infectious diseases or the complications of childbirth, ” says Scientific American magazine." "Huk revistan nin: “[Estados Unidos nacionpin] pisi runallaña wañushan contagiaq onqoykunawan otaq wawata onqokuspapas [...]."
"“Infant mortality is down by 75 percent since 1960. ”" "Wawakunapas 1960 watakunamantaqa aswan pisillañan wañushanku ”, nispa."
"But science has met with limited success in extending adult longevity. “Even after decades of research, aging largely remains a mystery, ” says another edition of Scientific American." "Ichaqa cienciaqa manan yanapawanchischu aswan unayta kawsanapaq, kaq revistallataqmi huk kutinpi chaymanta rimaspa nirqan: “Unayña estudiashanku chaypas kunankaman mana yachakunchu imarayku machuyapusqanchista.

"However, “evidence suggests that aging may occur when genetic programs for development go awry. ”" "Pruebakunata ruwaspan yachakun celulanchiskuna ukhupi imapas mana allinta llank’aqtin machuyapusqanchista ”, nispa."
"The article continues: “If aging is primarily a genetic process, conceivably it could one day be preventable. ”" "Nillantaqmi: “Sichus machuyanchis celulanchiskuna ukhupi imapas mana allinta llank’aqtin chayqa, hayk’aqllapas atikunmanmi allichakuyta ”, nispa."
"“Even after decades of research, aging largely remains a mystery ”" "“Unayña estudiashanku chaypas kunankaman mana yachakunchu imarayku machuyapusqanchista ”"
"In their search for the underlying causes of aging, including age - related diseases, some scientists are exploring recent developments in a field of genetics called epigenetics." "Runakunaqa yachaytan munanku imarayku machuyasqanchista, machuyaqtinchis onqoykuna hap’iwasqanchismantapas, chaytan nikun epigenética nisqa."
"What is epigenetics?" "¿Imatan chay estudian?"
"Living cells contain genetic information, which is needed for the production of new cells." "Celulanchiskuna ukhupin grabasqa kashan huk celulakunata imaynata kamakunanpaq."
"Much of this information is found in the genome, a term that refers to all the DNA in a cell." "Chay grabasqa kaqmi yaqa llapan tarikun genoma nisqapi, chayqa ADN nisqan."
"In recent times, however, scientists have delved deeper into another array of mechanisms within the cell ​ — the epigenome, a word that can mean “above the genome. ”" "Kay qhepa watakunapin wakin cientificokuna astawan estudiashallankutaq celulanchiskuna ukhunpi hukkuna sucedesqantapas, chay sucedesqankunan sutichakun epigenoma nispa."
"Epigenetics is the study of this amazing group of mechanisms and their chemical reactions." "Epigenética nisqataq epigenomata estudian."
"The molecules that make up the epigenome look nothing like DNA." "Epigenoma nisqapi kaqkunaqa hukniraymi ADN nisqamanta."
"Whereas DNA resembles a twisted ladder, or double helix, the epigenome is essentially a system of chemical marks, or tags, that attach to DNA." "ADN nisqaqa q’ewisqa otaq k’uyusqa escalera hinan, epigenomataq ADN nisqaman k’askasqa markachakuna hina."
"What is the role of the epigenome?" "¿Imatan ruwan epigenoma nisqa?"
"Like a conductor directing an orchestra, the epigenome directs the way genetic information in the DNA is expressed." "ADN nisqapi willakuykunatan kamachin imaynan wasi hatarichiypi maestroqa llank’aqninkunata kamachin hinata."
"The molecular tags turn sets of genes on or off in response to both the needs of the cell and environmental factors, such as diet, stress, and toxins." "ADN nisqapi willakuykunatan kamachin “llank’anankupaq ” otaq“ mana llank’anankupaqpas ” chayqa kanqa celulaq necesitasqanman hinan otaq imachus mikhusqanchismanta, imayna sientekusqanchismanta hukkunamantapas."
"Recent discoveries involving the epigenome have caused a revolution in the biological sciences, one that links epigenetics with specific diseases and even aging." "Epigenética nisqapi chayllaraq imaymana tarisqankun biología nisqata astawanraq ñawparichishan, chaymi epigenoma nisqaman tunpashanku wakin onqoykunamanta machuyaymantapas."
"“[Epigenetics is] implicated in diseases from schizophrenia to rheumatoid arthritis, and from cancer to chronic pain, ” says epigenetics researcher Nessa Carey. And it“ definitely has a role to play in ageing. ”" "Nessa Carey investigadoran nin: “[Epigenoma nisqamanmi] tunpakun locoyapuqkunaq onqoyninta, artritis reumatoide onqoyta, cancer onqoyta, unay tiempo nanaykunata huk onqoykunatapas, astawanqa machuyaytan apamun ”, nispa."
"Thus, research into epigenetics may lead to effective therapies for improving health, fighting disease ​ — including cancer — ​ and therefore extending life." "Chhaynaqa allinta estudiaspaqa tarinkumanmi ima hampillatapas saludninchista allinyachinanpaq, onqoykunata chinkachinanpaq chhaynapitaq astawan kawsasunman."
"At present, however, no major breakthroughs are on the horizon." "Ichaqa manaraqmi chaykunaqa rikukunchu."
"“We’re still stuck with our old routine [for combating ageing], ” says Carey,“ lots of vegetables ” and “plenty of exercise. ”" "Chaymi Carey nin: “Tukuy tiempon nishallanchis [ama machuyanapaqqa] askha verdurakunatan mikhuna ejerciciotataq ruwana nispalla, chay niyllapin muyurishanchis ”, nispa."
"Why, though, do humans go to so much trouble to extend life?" "¿Imaraykutaq unaytari kawsayta munanchis?"
"Why do we want to live indefinitely?" "¿Imanaqtinmi wiñaypaq kawsayta munanchis?"
"The British newspaper The Times asked: “Why this universal human obsession with cheating death, whether through immortality, resurrection, afterlife or reincarnation? ”" "Huk periodicopas nirqanmi: “Lliw runan mana wañuyta munanchu, otaq wañuspapas kawsarimpuytan munanku, wañusqanku qhepaman huk ladopi kawsashallayta otaq huk cuerpopi kutimuytapas, ¿imaraykun chhaynata yuyaykunku? ”, nispa."
"The answer, as we shall now see, sheds light on the real underlying cause of aging." "Chayta kutichinapaqmi yachasun imaraykupuni machuyasqanchista."
"For thousands of years, thinking people have wrestled with that question." "Unaymantañan askha runakuna chayta yachayta munarqanku."
"Is there a logical, satisfying explanation ​ — one that harmonizes with both our physical makeup and our natural desire to live forever?" "Wakintaqmi tapukunku imarayku wiñayta kawsanapaq hina kamasqa kasqanchista."
"Millions of people would answer with a resounding yes!" "¿Kanchu sut’i kutichiy chay tapuyman?"
"Why? In the Bible, they have found the most satisfying answers about human nature." "Millonninpi runakunan “arí ” nispa kutichinkuman, ¿imarayku?"
"From the outset, the Bible plainly states that humans, while having some things in common with other creatures, are fundamentally different." "Bibliapi kutichiyta tarisqankurayku."
"For example, at Genesis 1: 27, we read that God created humans in his image. How so? He gave us the capacity to display love, justice, and wisdom." "Qallariyninmantapachan Bibliaqa sut’ita willan animalkunamanta hukniray kasqanchista, chaytan Génesis 1: 27 textopas nin, ‘ Diosqa payman rikch’akuqtan runata kamarqan ’ nispa."
"And as the One who lives forever, God implanted in us the desire to live forever." "Runatan ruwarqan munakuyniyoq, yachayniyoq chanin kananpaq."
"He “planted eternity in men’s hearts and minds, ” says Ecclesiastes 3: 11. ​ — The Amplified Bible." "Eclesiastés 3: 11 texton nin: ‘ Payllataq runaq sonqonman wiñay kasqanta churarqan ’, nispa (Diosmanta Qhelqasqa)."
"Physical evidence that humans were originally designed to live much longer than we do can be seen in the power of the brain, especially in its potential to learn." "Wiñay kawsaq Diosqa runakunaq sonqonpin churarqan wiñay kawsayta munanankupaq."
"The Encyclopedia of the Brain and Brain Disorders states that the long - term memory capacity of the human brain “is virtually unlimited. ”" "Runaqa wiñaypaq kawsananpaq hinan kamasqa kashan."
"Why have this capacity if it were not meant to be used?" "¿Imaynapin chayta reparanchis?"
"Yes, in fundamental ways, humans reflect God’s original purpose for mankind." "Huk libron ñosqhonmanta onqoyninkunamantawan rimaspa nin: “Ñosqhonqa unayta imatapas yuyananpaq hinan, mana yupana atiytan chaykunata waqaychan ”, nispa."
"Then why do we grow old, suffer, and die?" "Wañupunanchiskamaqa pisichallatan ñosqhonninchistaqa utilizanchis."
"The first man and woman had perfect bodies along with free will." "Chaypin rikunchis wiñaypaq kawsanapaq Dios kamawasqanchista."
"Sadly, they misused that free will by rebelling against their Maker." "Chhaynaqa, ¿imaraykun machuyaspa wañupunchis?"
"* Their disobedience, or sin, caused them to have profound guilt and shame." "Ñawpa qharipas warmipas ch’uya cuerpoyoqmi karqanku atirqankutaqmi imatapas akllakuyta."
"It also resulted in damage to their bodies, triggering a slow, inexorable descent toward death." "Ichaqa mana allinta akllakuspan Kamaqninkuta qhepancharqanku (Génesis 2: 16, 17; 3: 6 - 11)."
"“The sting producing death is sin, ” states 1 Corinthians 15: 56." "1 Corintios 15: 56 textoq nisqan hina huchan wañuyta paqarichirqan."
"In line with the physical laws of inheritance, all of Adam and Eve’s descendants acquired imperfection and the inclination to sin, or do what is wrong." "Adán Evaq mirayninkuna kasqanchisraykun mana ch’uyachu nacerqanchis, herenciata hinan saqewarqanchis huchata."
"Says Romans 5: 12: “Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned. ”" "Romanos 5: 12 texton nin: “Imaynan huk runallawan huchaqa kay pachapi qallarirqan, huchawantaq wañuypas rikhurirqan, chay hinallataqmi, wañuyqa llapa runaman chayarqan llapallan huchallikusqankurayku ”, nispa."
"What can we conclude from the foregoing?" "¿Imatan chaymanta yachasunman?"
"But will he? The Bible answers with another resounding yes!" "Manan hayk’aqpas cienciawanqa atikunmanchu wiñaypaq wayna - sipaslla kayta."
"God has already taken a major step toward removing sin and death." "Hucharayku wañuy kasqantaqa Diosllan atin tatichiyta allichaytapas, ichaqa ¿munanchu chay ruwayta?"
"He sent Jesus Christ to give his life in our behalf." "Arí munanpunin, chaytan Biblia sut’ita willan."
"Jesus was born perfect and “committed no sin. ” Hence, he was entitled to endless, perfect life as a human." "Diosqa huchatapas wañuytapas tukuchinanpaqmi Churinta kachamurqan ñoqanchisrayku wañunanpaq."
"What did he do with his perfect life?" "¿Imaynatan yanapawanchis Cristoq wañusqan?"
"He willingly gave it up to pay for our sins." "Payqa mana huchayoqmi nacerqan."
"Yes, Jesus gave his life “a ransom in exchange for many. ”" "Chaymi wiñay kawsananpaq derechoyoq karqan, ichaqa huchanchisraykun wañurqan."
"Soon, that ransom will be fully applied in our behalf." "Chhaynapin “askha runa kacharichisqa ” karqanku."
"What can that mean for you? Consider these scriptures:" "Pisi tiempollamantan chay sacrificio ruwasqan tukuypi allinninchispaq kanqa, wakinkunan qatimuq textokunapi tarikun."
"“God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life. ” ​ — John 3: 16." "“Diosqa anchatapunin runakunata munakurqan, chaymi sapan Churinta kachamurqan, pipas paypi iñiqqa [...] wiñay kawsayniyoq kananpaq ”"
"“He will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces. ” ​ — Isaiah 25: 8." "“Diosqa wiñaypaqmi wañuytapas chinkachinqa, llapaq ñawinmantan waqaytapas ch’akichinqa ” (Isaías 25: 8)"
"“As the last enemy, death is to be brought to nothing. ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 15: 26." "“Qhepallataña ch’usaqyachina awqaqa wañuymi ”"
"“The tent of God is with mankind... And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more. ” ​ — Revelation 21: 3, 4." "“Runakunawanñan Diosqa tiyan [...] paykunaq ñawinkumanta tukuy weqeta pichanqa, manan wañuypas kanqañachu ”"
"How long can you live?" "Chhaynaqa, ¿atisunmanchu unaypaq kawsayta?"
"The Bible’s answer is clear: Humans can have the hope of living forever ​ — a hope that will be fulfilled after God cleanses the earth of all badness." "Biblian sut’ita nin runaqa wiñaypaq kawsayniyoq kananta, chaymi hunt’akunqa kay pachapi mana allin kaqkunata Dios chinkachiqtin (Salmo 37: 28, 29)."
"Jesus had that precious hope in mind when he said to a man impaled next to him: “You will be with me in Paradise. ” ​ — Luke 23: 43." "Jesusqa chayta yuyaspan ladonpi warkusqa runata nirqan paywan paraisopi kananta."
"Yes, the human desire to live forever is both reasonable and natural." "Wiñaypaq kawsay munasqanchisqa manan huchachu."
"God made us that way! Moreover, he will satisfy that desire." "Chhaynatan Diosqa kamawarqanchis, chay munasqanchistataqmi qowasunchis (Salmo 145: 16)."
"We must do our part, however. For instance, we need to build faith in God." "Ichaqa ñoqanchispas kallpachakunanchismi."
"“Without faith it is impossible to please [God] well, for he that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him, ” says Hebrews 11: 6." "Diospin iñinanchis, Hebreos 11: 6 texton nin: “Pipas mana iñiyniyoq kaspaqa manan Diospa sonqonman chayaqtapuni ruwayta atinmanchu. Chhaynaqa, pipas Diosman asuykuqqa iñinanpunin Diospa kasqanta, Diosqa maskhaqninkunata saminchaq kasqantapas ”, nispa."
"Such faith is not credulity but is an intelligent conviction based on accurate Bible knowledge." "Iñiyqa manan creeyllachu aswanpas Bibliaq yachachisqan sut’i kasqanta reparaspa creeymi."
"If you would like to gain that faith, please speak to Jehovah’s Witnesses locally or visit our Web site at www.jw.org." "Sichus chay hina iñiyniyoq kayta munanki chayqa, Jehová Diospa testigonkunata maskhay tiyasqayki llaqtapi otaq haykuy www.jw.org / quz nisqapi."

"The Bible condemns drunkenness and overindulgence but not the moderate consumption of alcohol." "Bibliaqa huchachanmi machayta nishu trago ukyaytapas ichaqa manan huchachanchu pisilla ukyaytaqa."
"Indeed, from time immemorial, men and women of God drank wine, a beverage mentioned over two hundred times in the Bible." "Aswanpas willanmi ñawpa tiempokunamantaraq Diospa siervonkuna vino ukyasqankuta, Bibliapiqa askha kutitan vinomanta riman (Génesis 27: 25)."

"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "“Diosqa munanmi paypaq hina ch’uyatapuni kawsanaykichista."
"“For this is what God wills,... that you abstain from fornication. ” ​ — 1 Thessalonians 4: 3." "Chayrayku, ama pipas qhelli huchapi kawsaychischu ” (1 Tesalonicenses 4: 3)"
"Some cultures tolerate sexual activity between consenting unmarried adult individuals." "Wakin llaqtakunapiqa manan huchapaqchu qhawarinku mana casarasqa kashaspa warmi - qhari puñuyta."
"In some areas it is viewed as acceptable for unmarried adolescents to engage in some forms of sexual intimacy." "Wayna - sipaskuna munanakuspa q’apinakusqankutapas huk ladokunapiqa allinpaqmi qhawarinku."
"The Bible uses the word “fornication ” for some forms of sexual activity outside marriage." "Diosqa serviqninkunatan nin: “Ama pipas qhelli huchapi kawsaychischu ”, nispa."
"God expects his worshippers to “abstain from fornication. ”" "‘ Qhelli hucha ’ nispan Bibliapiqa nikun mana casarasqa kashaspa warmi - qhari q’apinakuykunata."
"Fornication is listed as a serious sin, as are adultery, spiritism, drunkenness, idolatry, murder, and thievery. ​ — 1 Corinthians 6: 9, 10; Revelation 21: 8." "Manaraq casarasqa kashaspa warmi - qhari puñuyqa wasanchay hucha, layqakuy, machay, ídolo yupaychay, runa wañuchiy, suwakuy ruwaykuna hina sinchi mana allinmi."
"For one thing, the Bible warns that “God will judge fornicators. ”" "Biblian nin: “Qhelli huchapi puriqkunatan [...] Diosqa huchachanqa ”, nispa."
"More important, by obeying God’s laws about sexual morality, we prove our love for Jehovah God." "Ichaqa manan chayraykullachu kasukunanchis qhelli huchamanta karunchakunanchispaq Diospa kamachiwasqanchistaqa, aswanpas payta munakusqanchisraykun."
"He in turn blesses those who observe his commandments. ​ — Isaiah 48: 18." "Diosqa bendecinmi kamachikuynin kasukuqkunataqa (Isaías 48: 18)."
"“Let fornication and uncleanness of every sort or greediness not even be mentioned among you. ” ​ — Ephesians 5: 3." "“Qankuna ukhupiqa ama rimayllapas kachunchu qhelli huchapi puriymanta, tukuy mana chanin kaymanta, munapayaymantapas ” (Efesios 5: 3)"
"Many people believe that apart from sexual intercourse, there is nothing wrong with sexual intimacies between unmarried partners." "Askha runakunan ninku: “Warmi - qhari puñuyta mana ruwaspalla soltero warmi - qharikuna munanakuspa q’apinakusqankuqa manan huchachu ”, nispa."
"When discussing immoral sexual practices, the Bible mentions not only fornication but also sexual “uncleanness ” and“ loose conduct. ”" "Bibliaqa manan qhelli hucha ruwayllamantachu riman, rimallantaqmi “millay qhelli ruwaykunamanta ”,“ mana p’enqarikuspa ruwaykunamantapas ”."
"Clearly, there are various forms of sexual intimacy that are offensive to God when performed outside marriage, even when there is no intercourse." "Chhaynaqa mana casarasqa kashaspa warmi - qhari munanakuspa q’apinakusqankupiqa kallantaqmi ‘ millay qhelli ruwaykuna ’, ‘ mana p’enqarikuspa ruwaykunapas ’, manaña warmi - qhari puñuyta ruwarqankuchu chaypas, chay ruwaykunaqa anchatan Diosta phiñachin."
"The overall message of the Bible regarding sex is that sexual intimacies are restricted to a man and a woman who are married to each other." "Bibliaq nisqanman hinaqa casarasqakunallan munanakuyninkutaqa rikuchinakunanku."
"The Bible also disapproves of “covetous sexual appetite. ”" "Bibliapiqa huchachakullantaqmi ‘ millay munapayaykunata ’."
"What does that mean?" "¿Imatan chaywan nishan?"
"Consider an example that could apply equally to a man or a woman: A woman might be determined not to have intercourse with her boyfriend." "Kaypi yuyaykusun: Yaqapaschá huk warmi otaq huk qhari yuyaykunman munakusqan runawan mana puñunanpaq ichaqa munanakusqankupitaq q’apinakunkuman."
"Still, she engages in other forms of sexual intimacy with him. By doing so, they are coveting or lusting after something that does not belong to them." "Manataq casarasqachu kanku chayqa mana ruwananku kaqtan munapayashanku, urmashankutaqmi ‘ millay munapayayman ’, chaytaqa Bibliaqa huchachanmi."
"“Flee from fornication. ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 6: 18." "“Qhelli huchapi puriymanta ayqeychis ” (1 Corintios 6: 18)"
"According to the Bible, those who engage in premarital sex are in danger of losing their friendship with God. ​ — Colossians 3: 5, 6." "Bibliaq nisqanman hinaqa mana casarasqa kashaspa warmi - qhari puñuypi kaqkunaqa manañan Diospa amigonchu kapunkuman."
"The Bible advises people to “flee from fornication. ”" "1 Corintios 6: 18 texton nin: “Qhelli huchapi puriymanta ayqeychis ”, nispa."
"This means that a person needs to stay as far away as possible from anything that could lure him or her into sexual immorality." "Chay nisqanta kasukusqanchistan rikuchisun tukuy qhelli huchaman apaq ruwaykunamanta karunchakuspa (Proverbios 22: 3)."
"For instance, in order to remain morally clean, it is vital for one to avoid close association with people who ignore God’s principles related to sex." "Ch’uyata kawsayta munaspaqa Diospa kamachikuyninkunata mana kasukuq runakunamantan karunchakunanchis."
"The Bible warns: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly. ” ​ — Proverbs 13: 20." "Biblian niwanchis: “Yachayniyoqkunawan puriqqa yachayniyoqmi kapunqa, mana yuyayniyoqkunawan puriqmi ichaqa waqllipunqa ”, nispa (Proverbios 13: 20)."
"Feeding the mind with immoral thoughts can also lead to sexual misconduct." "Qhelli ruwaykunapi yuyaykuypas qhelli huchamanmi urmachiwasunman."
"Thus, it is wise to avoid music, videos, printed material, and anything else that improperly portrays sexual activity or that in any way promotes sexual conduct that offends God. ​ — Psalm 101: 3." "Chayraykun mana qhawananchischu Diospa huchachasqan qhelli hucha ruwaymanta peliculakunata revistakunata nitaq uyarinanchischu mana allin takikunatapas (Salmo 101: 3)."
"HELP FOR THE FAMILY | MARRIAGE" "FAMILIAKUNAPAQ YANAPAYKUNA | CASARASQAKUNAPAQ"
"When you and your spouse argue, you often bring up the past, rehashing a list of old grievances that should have been settled long ago." "Yaqapaschá imamantapas phiñachinakuspaykichis ñawpa tiempopi imapipas pantasqaykichista yuyarichinakunkichis."
"The problem?" "¿Imaraykun chaykuna suceden?"
"One or both of you may not know how to forgive." "Ichaqa yachawaqchismi pampachanakuyta."
"You can learn." Yuyarichinankurayku.
"First, though, consider why a husband and wife may find it so difficult to forgive each other." "Wakinqa manan qosankuta otaq esposankuta pampachayta munankuchu yuyarichinankurayku."
"Power. Some husbands and wives withhold forgiveness to maintain a sort of power over their spouse." "Chaymi qhepakunapi ima phiñachinakuypas kaqtinqa pantasqankuta yuyarichinku atipanankupaq."
"Then, when a conflict arises, they use a past event as a trump card to gain the upper hand." "Sonqonkupi k’irisqa kasqankurayku."
"Resentment. The scars of a past offense can take a long time to heal." "Phiñachinakuypi sonqota k’irinakuyqa unaypin chinkanman."
"A spouse might say ‘ I forgive you ’ but still harbor resentment for what happened ​ — perhaps craving to get even." "Yaqapaschá pipas ninman “pampachaniñan ” nispa, sonqonpitaq ichaqa phiñasqalla kashanman otaq qhepakunapi kaqllawan kutichinanpaq yuyaykushanman."
Disappointment. "Mana kaqllatachu yuyaykusqankurayku."
"Some people enter marriage fully believing that life will be like a fairy - tale romance." "Wakinqa ninkun: “Casarakuspaqa mana phiñachinakuspallan sumaqta kawsakusaqku ”, nispa."
"So when a disagreement arises, they dig in their heels, wondering just how their “perfect match ” could possibly see things from a different point of view." "Ichaqa reparanku mana kaqllatachu iskayninkupas yuyaykusqankuta, chaymi munasqankuman hinapuni ruwayta munanku."
"Unrealistic expectations can make a person more prone to find fault and less inclined to forgive." "Chaymi pantasqankuta qhawaspa ninku: “Khayna kanaykipaqqa manan yuyaykurqanichu ”, nispa, sasachakunkutaqmi pampachanankupaqpas."
Misunderstanding. "Mana allinta yuyaykusqankurayku."
"Many spouses withhold forgiveness because they misunderstand what extending it will mean." "Wakinqa ninkun: “Pampachaqtiyqa paychá riki munayninta ruwakapushanman ”, nispa."
"For example:" "Hinaspapas nillankutaqmi:"
"If I forgive, I am minimizing the wrong." "“Pampachaspaqa pantasqantapas hinallata qhawayman hinachá kanman ”, nispa"
"If I forgive, I have to forget what happened." "“Pampachaspaqa qonqapunaychá kanqa ruwawasqanta ”, nispa"
"If I forgive, I am inviting further mistreatment." "“Pampachaqtiyqa qhepakunamanchá kaqllata ruwawanqa ”, nispa"
"Really, forgiving does not imply any of the foregoing." "Ichaqa pampachayqa manan chhaynata yuyaykuychu."
"Still, extending forgiveness can be difficult ​ — especially in the close relationship between husband and wife." "Chaywanpas sasan kanman, astawanqa casarasqakunapaq."
"Understand what forgiveness involves." "Imachus pampachay kasqanta entiendeychis."
"In the Bible, at times the word “forgive ” means“ let go. ”" "Bibliapi tarikuq “pampachay ” simiqa,“ saqepuy ” nispan nikullanmantaq."
"So forgiveness does not always require that you forget what happened or minimize the wrong." "Chhaynaqa pampachayqa manan pantasqankuta qonqapuyllachu otaq pantasqankuta aguantayllachu."
"Sometimes it means that you simply need to let go of a matter, for your own well - being and that of your marriage." "Aswanpas ima phiñachinakuytapas ‘ saqepuymi ’, chay ruwayqa allinmi kanqa sapankaykichis casado kawsayniykichispi thak kanaykichispaq."
"Recognize the consequences of not forgiving." "Mana pampachanakuqtiykichis imachus kananpi yuyaykuychis."
"Some experts say that holding on to resentment can put you at greater risk for a wide range of physical and emotional problems, including depression and high blood pressure ​ — not to mention the damage it does to your marriage." "Wakin yachaqkunaq nisqanman hinaqa sonqonpi phiñasqalla kaqtaqa sinchi llakin hap’in, hinaspapas sonqomanta onqoymi hap’in, casarasqa kawsayninkupas manan allinchu."
"For good reason, the Bible says: “Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another. ” ​ — Ephesians 4: 32." "Chaymi Bibliapas nin: “Aswanpas sumaq sonqo kaychis, khuyapayanakuq, pampachaykunakuq ”, nispa."
"Recognize the benefits of forgiving." "Pampachanakusqaykichis allinniykichispaq kasqanpi yuyaykuychis."
"A spirit of forgiveness allows you and your mate to give each other the benefit of the doubt rather than to “keep score ” of wrongs." "Pampachaq runaqa manan yupashallanchu hayk’a kutitaña qosan otaq esposan phiñachisqanta, imapipas pantaqtinqa manan huchachanpachachu."
"That, in turn, helps you to create an environment that keeps resentment in check and allows love to grow. ​ — Bible principle: Colossians 3: 13." "Chayta ruwaspaqa munanakuspan kawsanqaku, manataq sonqonkuta k’irinakuspachu (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Colosenses 3: 13)."
"Be realistic." "Iskayniykichispas pantaqmi kankichis."
"It is easier to be forgiving when you accept your spouse for who he or she is, flaws and all." "Sichus pantaqña kaqtinpas esposaykita otaq qosaykita allinpaq qhawarinki chayqa manan sasachu kanqa pampachay."
"“When you focus on what you didn’t get, it’s too easy to forget all of what you did get, ” says the book Fighting for Your Marriage." "“Casado kawsayniykipi kallpachakuy ” (inglés simipi) nisqa libron nin:“ Sichus astawan yuyaykunki imakuna mana chaskisqaykipi chayqa, manan yuyaykuyta atinkichu imakuna chaskisqaykipi."
"“Which list do you want to dwell on at this point in life? ”" "¿Mayqenkaqpi yuyaykuytan munanki? ”, nispa."
"Remember, no one is perfect ​ — including you. ​ — Bible principle: James 3: 2." "Iskayniykichispas pantaqmi kankichis, chaytaqa manan qonqanaykichischu (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Santiago 3: 2)."
"Be reasonable." "Allinta reparaychis."
"The next time you are offended by something that your spouse said or did, ask yourself: ‘ Is the situation really that important?" "Hukpi phiñachinakuspaqa kaypi yuyaykuychis: “¿Phiñakunapaq hinapunichu chay ruwasqan otaq rimasqanpas karqan?"
"Do I need to demand an apology, or can I just overlook what happened and move on? ’ ​ — Bible principle: 1 Peter 4: 8." "¿Pampachakunanpaq hinapunichu ruwasqan karqan icha qonqapunapaq hinallachu? ”, nispa (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: 1 Pedro 4: 8)."
"If necessary, discuss the matter." "Rimana kaqtinqa rimaychis."
"Calmly explain what offended you and why it made you feel that way." "Imamantapas phiñakuspaqa sumaqllata rimaychis imachus phiñachisqasuykichismanta imarayku chhayna sientekusqaykichismantapas."
"Do not impute bad motives or make dogmatic statements, since these will only put your spouse on the defensive." "Ama ninakuychischu “chayraykun kayraykun chaytaqa ninki otaq ruwanki ” nispaqa, nitaq imatapas niychischu chhaynapunipas kanman hinataqa."
"Instead, simply relate how your spouse’s actions affected you." "Chayta ruwaspaqa sapankan rimasqaykichista valechiyta munankichis."
"“Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. ” ​ — Colossians 3: 13." "Aswanpas imaynatachus phiñachisqallasuykita willay. “Qankunapura paciencianakuychis, pipas hukpa contranpi imatapas riman chayqa, pampachaykunakuychis ”"
"“We all stumble many times. ” ​ — James 3: 2." "“Llapanchismi imaymanapi pantanchis ”"
"“Love covers a multitude of sins. ” ​ — 1 Peter 4: 8." "“Munakuyqa askha huchakunatan pampachan ”"
"If you have hurt your spouse in some way, sincerely apologize." "Qosaykiqta otaq esposaykiq sonqonta k’irispaqa pampachayta mañakuy."
"Even if you do not agree with your spouse’s view of the matter, you can ask forgiveness for what you have done that resulted in hurt feelings." "Manañak’iriq simikunachu karqan qhawarisqaykiman hina chaypas pampachayta mañakuy, yaqapaschá imaynallapipas sonqonta k’irirqanki."
"If you work hard to avoid repeating the same mistake, you will give your spouse confidence that your apology was genuine." "Manaña k’irinakunaykichispaq kallpachakunkichis chayqa rikuchinkichismi sonqomanta pampachay mañakusqaykichista."

"For many, the goal is to look well - off even if they are deep in debt." "Askha runakunan qhapaq hina qhawarisqa kayta munanku, chaymi rantishallanku hukman hukmanña manu kanku chaypas."

"Bible principles to consider:" "Bibliaq yachachikuyninkuna:"
"“Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal. ” ​ — Matthew 6: 19." "“Ama qhapaq kaykunata kay pachapi huñukuychischu, kaypiqa thutapas thutanmi qhoqayaypas ismuchinmi, suwakunapas wasita haykuspan suwakun ”"

"“Having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things. ” ​ — 1 Timothy 6: 8." "“Mikhunanchispaqpas p’achakunanchispaqpas kashaqtinqa, chaykunawanmi sonqopas - sonqo kashananchis ”"
"“Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need. ” ​ — Matthew 5: 3." "“Kusisamiyoqmi huch’uyyaykukuspa Diosta maskhaqkunaqa ”"

"Really, the greatest satisfaction in life comes from answering important questions such as these:" "Cheqaq kusikuyta tarinapaqqa kay tapuykunaq kutichiynintan yachananchis:"
"Why are we here?" "¿Imaraykun kawsanchis?"
"What does the future hold?" "¿Imaynan hamuq tiempoman kawsay kanqa?"

"Names in this article have been changed." "Wakin sutikunan cambiakun."
"“On average, ” says The Narcissism Epidemic,“ materialistic people are less happy and more depressed." "“Qolqe sonqo runakunaqa manan kusisqachu kawsanku, ratollan sinchi llaki onqoypi tarikunku."
"Even people who simply aspire to have more money suffer from poor mental health; they also report more physical health problems such as sore throats, backaches, and headaches and were more likely to drink too much alcohol and use illegal drugs." "Qolqeyoq kayta munaypas runakunatan sonqonkupi llakichin, hinaspapas kunkanku, wasanku, umankun nanan."

"“When asked about reasons for going to college during the 1960s and early seventies, most students placed the highest value on ‘ becoming an educated person ’ or ‘ developing a philosophy of life. ’" "“1960 watakunapi 1970 wata qallariykunapi iman estudiantekunata tapurqanku imarayku universidadman risqankuta, hinan askha kutichirqanku ‘ allin educacionniyoq ’ otaq ‘ imatapas allinta yachanankupaq ’ risqankuta."

"This shift in values among college students takes place at the same time that rates of depression, suicide, and other psychological problems have risen dramatically among this group. ” ​ — The Price of Privilege, by Dr." "Estudiantekunaqa manañan kaqllatachu yuyaykurqanku, chay tiempokunallapitaqmi paykunaqa sinchi llaki onqoywan hap’ichikurqanku, kikinkuta wañuchikurqanku yuyayninkupipas manan allinchu karqanku."
"Madeline Levine. According to Dr." "Chaykunaqa nishutapunin yapakurqan ” (El precio del privilegio, de la psicóloga Madeline Levine)."
"Madeline Levine, spending can become “retail therapy ” that gives people a measure of comfort in a world where family, community, and church have failed them." "Madeline Levine psicóloga nisqanman hinaqa, familiankupi llaqtankupi religionninkupi mana ima allintapas tarispankun runakunaqa imaymanata rantispa thak sientekuyta munanku."
"“Shopping is one way to control our environment, ” she writes in The Price of Privilege." "Huk libro qelqasqanpin nin: “Rantispaqa imachus munasqanchistan ruwanchis, negociokunatan ruwanchis."
"“It puts us in charge of transactions and confers a sense of power on the buyer." "Qolqeta gastaspaqa atiyniyoqmi sientekunchis, ichaqa chay atiyniyoq sientekuyqa yanqan."
"This type of power is illusory..." "Aswan atiyniyoqqa kanku chay hatun empresakunan propagandankunata ruwaqkunapas."
"The real power is being exerted by large corporations and their advertisers, who are paid to suggest that consumer goods confer magical and protective powers on buyers. ”" "Chay propaganda ruwaqkunaqa pagasqa kasqankuraykun runakunata creechinku imatapas rantiyqa thak kayta allin kawsayta apamusqanta ”, nispa (El precio del privilegio)."
"WAS IT DESIGNED?" "¿KIKILLANMANTACHU PAQARIMURQAN?"
"THE South American bush katydid (Copiphora gorgonensis) has ears less than a millimeter long, yet they work in a way very similar to human ears." "AMÉRICA del sur nisqapi tiyaq ch’illikuq (t’isku - t’isku) ninrinqa (Copiphora gorgonensis) nishu huch’uypunin, chaywanpas runaq ninrin hinan allinta uyarin."
"The insect can distinguish a wide range of frequencies from long distances." "Chay animalchaqa karumantaraqmi reparan imaymana clase sonidokunata."
"For example, it can tell the difference between the sound of another katydid and the ultrasound of a bat that is hunting." "Reparanmi huk ch’illikuq waqasqanta, mikhuqnin murcielagoq waqasqantapas."
"KATYDID’S EAR" "CH’ILLIKUQ NINRIN"
"Consider: The katydid’s ears are located on its two front legs." "Kaypi yuyaykuy: Ch’illikuq ninrinkunaqa ñawpaq chakinkunapin tarikun."
"Like the human ear, the ear of the katydid collects sound, converts it, and analyzes the frequency." "Runaq ninrin hinan ch’illikupas uyarispa reparan ima sonido kasqanta."
"But scientists have discovered a unique organ inside the ear of this insect ​ — a pressurized fluid - filled cavity that looks like an elongated balloon." "Ninrin ukhupin cientificokuna tarirqanku hunt’a unuyoq huch’uy bolsata hina."
"This organ, which they named the acoustic vesicle, works like the cochlea of mammals but is much smaller." "Chaytan suticharqanku “hayaqenman rikch’akuq uyariq bolsa ” nispa, chayqa nishu huch’uyllan, chaywanpas wakin animalkunaq ninrin ukhunpi kaq cóclea nisqa hinan allinta uyarin."
"The acoustic vesicle is responsible for the katydid’s remarkable hearing." "Chayraykun ch’illikuq ninrinqa admirakunapaq hina."
"Professor Daniel Robert, of the University of Bristol’s School of Biological Sciences in the United Kingdom, says this discovery will help engineers “develop bio - inspired hearing devices that are smaller and more accurate than ever before. ”" "Bristol universidadmanta (Reino Unido) Daniel Robert profesormi nirqan: “Chay animalchamanta yachayqa ingenierokunatan yanapanqa allinta uyariq aswan huch’uy aparatokunata ruwanankupaq ”, nispa."
"Researchers believe it will also contribute to the next generation of ultrasonic engineering technology, including imaging systems for hospitals." "Estudioso runakunapas yuyaykunku chaymanta yachasqankuqa yanapanqan runaq mana uyariy atisqan allinta uyariq maquinakunata ruwanankupaq, chaytaqa hospitalkunapin utilizanku."
"What do you think?" "¿Iman ninkin chaymanta?"
"Did the remarkable hearing of the katydid come about by evolution? Or was it designed?" "¿Kikillanmantachu ch’illikuq ninrin allin uyariq karqan icha kamasqachu karqan?"
"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"“I have become disconcerted, I have bowed low to an extreme degree; all day long I have walked about sad. ” ​ — Psalm 38: 6." "“Llakisqallapunin purini, unphullapunin khuyayllapunin purini ” (Salmo 38: 6)"
"Everyone feels down now and then, but clinical depression is a debilitating disorder that is ongoing and that interferes with a person’s daily life." "Llapanchismi mayninpiqa llakisqa tarikunchis, llaki onqoywan kaqkunan ichaqa sapa kutillan llakiq ñit’isqan kashanku, chaymi pisikallpa tarikunku manataqmi ruwanankutapas allintachu ruwanku."
"It should be noted that not all experts agree on what is “normal ” sadness and what constitutes a“ disorder. ”" "Yachayniyoqkunaqa manan kaqllatachu yuyaykunku hayk’aqchus huk runa llaki onqoywan kashan hayk’aqtaqchus imamantapas llakisqa kashan chaytaqa."
"However, it is safe to say that some people experience profoundly negative emotions, at times accompanied by feelings of worthlessness and inordinate guilt." "Ichaqa wakinqa nishutan mana allinkunallapi yuyaykunku, chaymi mana valeqpaq qhawarikunku imamantapas nishuta huchachakunku ima."
"The Bible tells of many men and women who experienced negative emotions." "Biblian riman askha runakuna llakipi tarikusqankumanta."
"For example, Hannah felt “bitter of soul ” ​ — a phrase that has been rendered as“ brokenhearted ” and “deeply distressed. ”" "Anaqa ‘ llakisqan sonqonpi ’ tarikurqan (1 Samuel 1: 10)."
"On one occasion the prophet Elijah was so grief - stricken that he prayed for God to take his life! ​ — 1 Kings 19: 4." "Profeta Eliaspas huk kutinmi sinchi llakisqa kaspa Diosta nirqan: “Kawsayniyta qechupuway ”, nispa (1 Reyes 19: 4)."
"First - century Christians were instructed to “speak consolingly to the depressed souls. ”" "Ñawpa tiempopi cristianokunaqa ‘ manchalikunata [llakisqa kaqkunatan, NM] yanapananku ’ karqan."
"According to one reference work, the term “depressed souls ” can refer to those“ who are temporarily overwhelmed by the stress of life. ”" "Bibliamanta willaq qelqaq nisqanman hinaqa ‘ llakisqakunaqa ’ kankumanmi “imaynapipas tarikusqankumanta pisikallpayaqkuna ”."
"Clearly, even faithful men and women of the Bible at times felt depressed." "Diosta serviq runakunapas mayninpiqa sinchi llakisqan karqanku."
"“All creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together. ” ​ — Romans 8: 22." "“Yachanchismi Diospa tukuy imaymana kamasqankunaqa kunankama waqasqankuta muchusqankutapas ” (Romanos 8: 22)"
"The Bible teaches that illness is a by - product of the rebellion of the first human couple." "Adán Evaq huchallikusqankuraykun runakunaqa onqonchis."
"For example, Psalm 51: 5 states: “With error I was brought forth with birth pains, and in sin my mother conceived me. ”" "Salmo 51: 5 texton nin: “Cheqaqtapunin huchallantinña nacerqani, huchallantintañan mamay wachakuwarqan ”, nispa."
"And Romans 5: 12 explains that “through one man [the first human, Adam] sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned. ”" "Romanos 5: 12 textopas ninmi: “Imaynan huk runallawan [Adán] huchaqa kay pachapi qallarirqan, huchawantaq wañuypas rikhurirqan, chay hinallataqmi, wañuyqa llapa runaman chayarqan llapallan huchallikusqankurayku ”, nispa."
"Because we have inherited imperfection from Adam, each of us is susceptible to illness, both physical and emotional." "Adanpa miraynin kasqanchisraykun runakunaqa imaymanawan onqonchis."
"As a result, says the Bible, “all creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together. ”" "Chayraykun Diosqa willarqan “tukuy imaymana kamasqankunaqa kunankama waqasqankuta ”."
"However, the Bible also offers a hope that no physician can extend ​ — God’s promise of a peaceful new world in which all sicknesses and disorders, including depression, will be gone. ​ — Revelation 21: 4." "Ichaqa willawallanchistaqmi qhepa tiempoman sumaq kawsay kananmanta, chaypiqa manañan llaki onqoypas huk onqoykunapas kanqañachu, chhayna suyakuymantaqa manan ima doctorpas niwasunmanchu."
"“Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves. ” ​ — Psalm 34: 18." "“Señor Diosqa llakisqa sonqoyoqkunaq qayllanpin kashan, payqa llakiq ñit’isqan sonqoyoqkunatan qespichin ” (Salmo 34: 18)"
"You cannot always control your circumstances, and bad things are bound to affect you at times." "Imapas qonqay sucedewasqanchisraykun ima llakipipas tarikusunman (Eclesiastés 9: 11, 12)."
"You can, however, develop a practical strategy so that negative feelings do not dominate your life." "Chhaynapi tarikuspa mana allin yuyaykuykunawan mana atipachikunapaqqa kaykunatan ruwananchis."
"The Bible acknowledges that those who are sick need a physician." "Onqosqakunaqa doctortan necesitanku."
"So if you suffer from a debilitating mood disorder, there is nothing wrong with seeking medical attention." "Chayrayku llaki onqoywan kashanki chayqa manan huchachu doctorman riyqa."
"The Bible also emphasizes the value of prayer." "Diosmanta mañakuypas allinmi."
"For example, Psalm 55: 22 says: “Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you." "Salmo 55: 22 texton nin: “Señor Diosman llakipakuyniykikunata saqey, paymi qaqata sayachisunki, manan hayk’aqpas chanin runataqa urmachisqa kananta munanqachu ”, nispa."
"Never will he allow the righteous one to totter. ”" "Diosmanta mañakuyqa manan thak kanallapaqchu, Biblian nin: “Señor Diosqa llakisqa sonqoyoqkunaq qayllanpin kashan ”, nispa."
"Prayer is not a psychological crutch; it is real communication with Jehovah God, who is “near to those that are broken at heart. ” ​ — Psalm 34: 18." "Chayraykun mañakuspaqa Dioswanpuni rimanchis (Salmo 34: 18)."
"You may also benefit by confiding your feelings to a close friend." "Huk amigoykiman tukuyta willakuypas yanapasunkimanmi (Proverbios 17: 17)."
"“A fellow believer gently coaxed me to talk about my depression, ” says Daniela, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses." "Daniela sutiyoq cristianan willakun: “Huk allin iñiyniyoq iñiqmasin sumaq sonqowan tapuwarqan, hinan ñoqaqa willakurqani llaki onqoyniyoq kasqayta."
"“Although I had been avoiding such a conversation for years, I soon realized that this was what I needed all along." "Askha watakunan chhayna onqoyniyoq kasqaymantaqa mana willakurqanichu, chay qhepamanmi ichaqa reparakurqani yanapayta ñawpaqmantaraq maskhanay kasqanta."
"I was surprised at how relieved I felt afterward. ”" "Willakusqayqa anchatapunin yanapawarqan ”, nispa."

"They are moral or ethical principles that we view as good and important." "Chay ruwaykunaqa allinta ch’uyata kawsananchispaqmi yanapawanchis, chaykunatan runaqa necesitan."
"They might include forgiveness, honesty, liberty, love, respect for life, and self - control." "Wakinkunan kaykuna: pampachay, honrado kay, munakuy, kawsayta respetay, hukkunapas."

"Despite their importance, however, moral values are in decline." "Rikusqanchis hina chaykunaqa ancha importanten ichaqa chinkapushanmi."
"In 2008, researchers in the United States interviewed hundreds of young adults about their views on moral values." "2008 watapin Estados Unidospi askha wayna - sipaskunata tapurqanku imakunachus allin ruwaykuna kasqanmanta."
"“What’s disheartening is how bad they are at thinking and talking about moral issues, ” said David Brooks in The New York Times." "Huk qelqapin David Brooks nirqan: “Manan reparankuchu imakunachus allin ruwaykuna kasqanta, chayqa ancha llakikunapaqmi ”, nispa."

"This sad reality is reflected in the world’s changing moral landscape ​ — a trend the Bible foretold. “In the last days, ” it said long ago,“ people will be selfish, greedy, boastful, and conceited, ” as well as “unkind [and] violent. ”" "Chayraykun runakunaqa mana allintachu kawsanku, Bibliapas nirqanñan: “Tukukuy qaylla p’unchaykunataqa [...] runakunan kanqa paykuna kikinkuta munakuqkuna, qolqe sonqokuna, alabakuqkuna, hatunchakuqkuna, [...] millay yana alma runakuna, tukuy allinkaqta cheqnikuqkuna."

"Those realities should move us to question our own heart, not blindly trust it!" "Chhaynaqa sonqonchis ima munasqantapas manaraq ruwashaspaqa allintan yuyaykunanchis, manan usqhayllachu ruwananchis."
"Indeed, the Bible frankly states: “He that is trusting in his own heart is stupid. ”" "Biblian sut’ita niwanchis: “Yuyaykusqallanman hap’ipakuqqa mana yuyayniyoqmi, yachaywan ruwaqmi ichaqa allillanpuni kanqa ”, nispa (Proverbios 28: 26)."

"Clearly, as humans, we need love." "Runaqa munasqa kaytan necesitan, mana chayqa manan kusisqachu kawsanman."

"What the Bible says: “Clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union. ”" "Ninmi: “Munakuq sonqo kaychis, munakuymi tukuy imatapas sumaqta hukllaman tukuchin ”, nispa."
"The same Bible writer also said: “If I... do not have love, I am nothing. ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 13: 2." "Chay librota qelqaqmi nillantaq: “Manataq munakuyniy kanmanchu chayqa, manan imapaschu kayman ”, nispa."
"That love is neither sexual nor purely sentimental; it is governed by principle. It is the kind of love that moves us to help a stranger in difficulty, with no thought of a reward." "Ichaqa manan huk qhari huk warmiwan imayna munanakusqankumantachu rimashan nitaq sonqopi imayna sientekusqamantachu; aswanpas chay munakuyqa Bibliaq nisqanman hinan, chay munakuymi tanqawanchis mana reqsisqa runata yanapanapaq."
"At 1 Corinthians 13: 4 - 7, we read: “Love is long - suffering and kind. [It] is not jealous, it does not brag, does not get puffed up, does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury." "1 Corintios 13: 4 - 7 texton nin: “Pipas munakuqqa [...] manan envidiakunchu, manan k’ankaykachanchu, manan hatunchakunchu, manan mana ruwanakunatachu ruwan, manan payllapaq kanantachu munan, manan phiñakunpachachu, manan sientepakunchu, manan mana chanin kaqmantachu kusikun, aswanpas cheqaqkaqmantan kusikun."

"It bears all things,... endures all things. ” When families lack such love, everybody suffers, especially children." "Chay munakuy familiapi mana kaqtinqa llapankun ñak’arinku, astawanqa wawakuna."
"A woman named Monica wrote that as a child, she endured physical, emotional, and sexual abuse." "Monican willakurqan erqe kashaqtin maqasqankuta k’amisqankuta abusasqankutapas."
"“I was unloved and without any hope, ” she said. Then, when she was 15 years of age, she moved in with her grandparents who are Jehovah’s Witnesses." "Paymi nin: “Manan munakuyniypas suyakuyniypas karqanchu ”, nispa. 15 watanpi kashaspan abuelonkunawan tiyaq ripurqan, paykunaqa Jehová Diospa testigonmi kanku."

"They helped me to become a respectable young woman. ”" "Paykunan yanapawarqanku allin sipas kanaypaq ”, nispa."
"Now, happily married, Monica along with her husband and three children shows love to others by sharing the Bible’s message with them." "Kunanqa qosanwan kinsa wawankunawan iman runakunata Bibliawan yanapashanku, chayta ruwaspan rikuchin runakuna munakusqanta."
"A particularly subtle enemy of love is materialism ​ — the belief that material well - being and pleasure are the highest values." "Qolqetapas kusirikuykunatapas aswan importantepaq qhawariyqa munakuytan chinkachin."
"Yet, secular studies repeatedly show that beyond a surprisingly modest threshold, more wealth does not bring more happiness." "Runakunaqa manan askha qolqeyoq kaspachu aswan kusisqa kawsanku, chaytan investigaq runakuna repararqanku."
"In fact, people who adopt materialistic values may actually be investing in unhappiness, a view that finds Biblical support." "Aswanpas qolqe sonqo runakunaqa llakipin tarikunkuman. Chaytan Bibliaqa yachachin."
"Ecclesiastes 5: 10 tells us: “A mere lover of silver will not be satisfied with silver, neither any lover of wealth with income." "Eclesiastés 5: 10 texton nin: “Qolqeman sonqollikuqqa, astawanpunin munan, imaymanayoq kayta munaqpas, astawanraqmi tariyta munan."

"For example, a woman named Karen saw three women ​ — a mother and her two daughters — ​ sitting in a car with its hood up." "Karen sutiyoq warmin rikurqan huk malograsqa carrota."
"The mother and one of the girls had to catch a plane; but their car would not start, and the taxi was late."

"THESE women were not ill. Rather, they were going through the menopause transition, a natural change in a woman’s life and the end of her fertility." "CHAY warmikunaqa manan onqosqankuraykuchu chhaynata sientekunku, aswanpas kawsayninkupi cambiasqankuraykun, chay qhepamanqa manañan wawayoq kayta atinqakuñachu."

"The menopause transition, also called perimenopause (around menopause), includes both the period leading up to menopause and menopause itself." "Chaymi yanapasunki menopausiapi sasachakuykunata atipanaykipaq."
"* In common usage, however, “menopause ” often refers to the entire transition." "12 killaña warmiq yawarnin mana hamuqtinmi doctorkunaqa ninku “menopausia ” nispa."
"Most women start perimenopause in their 40 ’ s, but some do so as late as their 60 ’ s." "Askha warmikunan 40 otaq 50 watanpi kashaspanku menopausiamanña haykushanku, wakintaqmi 60 watankupiña."

"Because of the erratic production of hormones, a woman may skip periods, bleed at odd times, or have extra - heavy periods." "Cuerponku cambiasqanraykun yawarninku mana hamunanpi hamunman otaq nishuta hamunman."
"A small number of women stop menstruating abruptly, almost overnight, as it were." "Wakin warmikunallapin yawarninku manaña hampunñachu."
"“Each woman’s menopause experience is different, ” says Menopause Guidebook." "Menopausiamanta rimaq libron nin: “Menopausiaqa manan kaqllachu llapa warmikunapaq."

"Others suffer for many years, and a very small percentage report occasional hot flashes for the rest of their lives. ” *" "Hukkunataq aswan más tiempo, maynillanpin wakin warmikunata tukuy tiempo hap’in ”, nispa * (Menopausiamanta rimaq libro, inglés simipi)."
"Because of fluctuating hormones, a woman may also experience depression and mood swings, resulting in weepiness, as well as poor concentration and lapses in memory." "Cuerponku cambiasqanraykun menopausiapi tarikuq warmikunataqa llaki onqoy hap’inman otaq ratolla caracterninku cambianman, chayraykun imamantapas ratolla waqanku."
"That said, “it’s highly unlikely that any one woman will get hit with everything, ” says The Menopause Book." "Chaymantapas sasatan imatapas yuyarinkuman, yaqapaschá mana tukuy yuyayninkuwanchu imatapas ruwanqaku."
"Indeed, some experience few, if any, problems and discomforts." "Otaq yaqapaschá wakillan chaykunamanta hap’inqa."
"Simple lifestyle changes may reduce some discomforts." "Huk libroq nisqan hina “manan tukuy chaykunachu hukllapi hap’inqa ”, nispa."
"For example, smokers may decrease the number of hot flashes by giving up tobacco." "Aswan allin sientekunaykipaqqa imayna kawsasqaykipin cambianayki. Mana fumayqa pisiyachinmi hump’i hoqariyta."
"Many women also benefit from dietary changes, such as limiting or even avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and spicy or sugary foods, which can trigger hot flashes." "Askha warmikunan pisillata otaq mana malliykunkupaschu alcoholta, cafeinata, hayakunata, azucartapas, chaykunaqa hump’itan hoqarichikun."
"Of course, it is important to eat well, which means having a balanced and varied diet." "Chaymantapas allintan alimentakunayki, chayqa ancha importanten."
"Exercise can also be a big help in reducing menopausal symptoms." "Ejercicio ruwaypas ancha allinmi."
"For instance, it can reduce insomnia and foster significant improvements in mood, as well as in bone strength and general health." "Cuerponchista tullunchistan yanapan allin kananpaq, hinaspapas yanapawallanchistaqmi allinta puñunapaq, caracterninchis allin kananpaqpas."

"Keep in mind, too, that “there is the true forgiveness with [God]. ” ​ — Psalm 130: 4." "Hinaspapas Diosqa cheqaqtapunin pampachawanchis (Salmo 130: 4)."

"Consider the following factors:" ¿Imarayku?
"MEDIA MOGULS." "Yachasunchis wakinmanta:"
"A small but very powerful number of corporations own primary media outlets. Those outlets exert a strong influence on which stories get covered, how they are covered, and how prominently they are covered." "NOTICIAKUNATA MUNAYCHAKUQKUNA Hatun empresakunan munaychakunku aswan importante noticierokunata, chaymi chay noticia willaqkunaqa chay empresakunaq munasqanman hina decidinku ima noticiakuna willayta, imayna willayta, askha runakuna rikunanpaq imakuna ruwaytapas."
"Because most corporations are designed for profit, decisions made by media outlets can be motivated by economic interests." "Chay empresakunaqa qhapaqyaytan astawanqa munanku, chayraykun ima decidisqankupas qolqerayku kanman."
"Stories that may hamper the profits of the owners of a news organization may go unreported." "Chaymi sichus mayqen noticiapas mana qolqeta ganachinanpaq hina kashan chayqa manapaschá willasqachu kanqa."
GOVERNMENTS. "GOBIERNOKUNA Noticiakunaqa politicamantan astawanqa riman."
"Much of what we learn in the media has to do with the people and the affairs of government." "Gobiernokunaqa munankun ima ruwasqankutapas runakuna allinpaq qhawarinankuta."
"Governments want to convince the public to support their policies and their officials." "Chaymi gobiernokunaqa periodistakunawan rimanakunku ima noticiatapas willanankupaq."
"And because the media draw on content from the government, journalists and government sources at times cooperate with one another." "PROPAGANDAKUNA Askha nacionkunapin noticiata willaqkunaqa qolqeta necesitanku llank’anankupaq, chaytaqa gananku propagandakunamantan."
"ADVERTISING. In most lands, media outlets must make money in order to stay in business, and most of it comes from advertising." "Estados Unidospi vendekuq revistakunaqa kuskan más qolqetan gananku propaganda ruwasqankumanta, periodicokunaqa aswan mastaraqmi, radiowan televisionwantaq propagandakunallamanta gananku."
"In the United States, magazines get between 50 and 60 percent of their revenue from advertising, newspapers 80 percent, and commercial television and radio 100 percent." "Propaganda churaqkunaqa manañan noticierokunata contratankuñachu sichus ima vendesqankutapas mana allinta qhawarichin chayqa, aswanpas huk noticierokunapin propagandankuta churanku."
"Understandably, advertisers do not want to sponsor programs that cast an unfavorable light on their products or style of management." "Chayta yachaspan periodistakunaqa propaganda churaqkunaq ima vendesqankutapas mana allinta qhawarichiq noticiakunataqa manaña willankuñachu."
"If they do not like what a news outlet is producing, they can advertise elsewhere." "MANA HONRADO KASQANKU Wakin periodistakunaqa mana kaqtan imatapas willanku."
"Knowing this, editors may suppress news stories that cast a negative light on sponsors." "Qayna watakunan Japonmanta huk periodista huk noticiata willayta munarqan Okinawa llaqtapi lamar - qochaman haykuq runakuna coral nisqakunata wañuchishasqankumanta."
"DISHONESTY. Not all reporters are honest." "Ichaqa mana imatapas tarispan pay kikin hukta kuchurqorqan fototapas horqorqan."
"Some journalists fabricate stories." "Runakunata engañanapaqqa atikunmi fotokunata huknirayman tukuchikuyta."
"A few years ago, for example, a reporter in Japan wanted to document how divers were defacing coral in Okinawa." "Chaytaqa allintan ruwanku, chaymi ima cambio ruwasqankutapas mana reparasunmanchu."
"After not finding any vandalized coral, he defaced some himself and then took photos of it." "IMAYNA WILLASQANKU Ima noticiapas sut’iña kashan chaypas, imayna willakunanmantaqa periodistamantan kanqa."
"Photos can also be manipulated to deceive the public." "¿Imakunatan willanqa? ¿Imakunatan mana willanqachu?"
"Photograph - altering technology has become more effective, and some manipulations are practically impossible to detect." "Yaqapaschá huk equipo ganachikurqan iskay golkunawan."
"SPIN. Even if facts are as solid as bricks, how they are presented depends on the judgment of the journalist." "Chayqa sut’in kashan, ichaqa imarayku ganachikusqankumantaqa munasqanman hinan huk periodistaqa willanman."
"What facts should be included in a story, and which should be left out?" "MANAN LLAPANTACHU WILLANKU Huk noticia uyarinapaq hina kananpaqqa periodistakunaqa wakillantan willamunku, sasa entiendena kaqkunataqa manañan willamunkuchu."
"A soccer team, for example, may have lost a match by two goals. That is a fact." "Chayraykun wakintaqa yapa - yapayuspa willanku hukkunatataq pisiyachispa."
"But why the team lost is a tale that a journalist can tell in many ways. OMISSION." "Chaymantapas televisionpiqa mayninpin huk minutollapi imatapas willananku, chaymi periodistakunaqa manaña llapantachu willanku."
"In arranging facts to create a compelling story, journalists often exclude details that would introduce complications or unresolved issues." "NOTICIATA WILLAQKUNAQA ASKHAN KANKU Kay qhepa watakunapin astawan yapakurqan televisionpi canalkuna, chayraykun runakunaqa huk - hukta qhawanku."
"This causes some facts to be exaggerated and others to be diminished." "Chaymi noticiata willaq canalkunaqa imaymanata ruwanku willasqankuta runakuna qhawanankupaq."
"Because television anchors and reporters may sometimes need to tell a complex story in a minute or so, important details can be skipped." "Huk libron nirqan: “[Televisionpi] noticierokunaqa qhawanapaq hinan imaymanata churamunku."
COMPETITION. "PANTAQMI KANKU Periodistakunapas pantaq runakunan kanku."
"In recent decades, as the number of television stations multiplied, the amount of time viewers spent watching just one station fell drastically." "Imatapas mana allinta qelqaqtinku, comatapas mana churanapi churaqtinkuqa ima qelqasqankupas pantasqatan entiendekunman."
"To keep viewers interested, news stations were compelled to offer something unique or entertaining." "Otaq yaqapaschá ima sucedesqanmantapas mana sut’itachu willamurqanku."
"Commenting on this development, the book Media Bias states: “The [television] news became a running picture show, with images selected to shock or titillate, and stories shortened to match an [ever - shorter] attention span on the part of viewers. ”" "Chaymantapas sichus huk periodista usqhaylla imatapas ruwanman tiemponpi tukunanpaq chayqa pantanmanmi."
"MISTAKES. Because they are human, journalists make honest mistakes." "“100.000 ” nispa churananmantaqa yaqapaschá“ 10.000 ” nispa churarunman."
"A misspelled word, a misplaced comma, an error in grammar ​ — these can all distort the meaning of a sentence." "IMAYNA ENTIENDESQANKU Huk noticiata sut’illanta willayqa manan facilchu."
"Facts may not be carefully checked." "Kunan imatapas sut’ipaq qhawarikusqanqa qhepamanmi manaña chhaynachu kanman."
"Numbers too can easily trip up a journalist who, in the scramble to meet a deadline, might easily type 10,000 instead of 100,000." "Ñawpaqpin creerqanku llapa planetakuna Hallp’aq muyuriqninpi muyushasqanta, ichaqa kunanmi yachanchis planetakuna intiq muyuriqninpi muyusqankuta."

"The Bible does not portray Jesus as being Almighty God or equal to God." "Jesusqa manan tukuy atiyniyoq Dioschu."
"On the contrary, it clearly teaches that Jesus is inferior to God." "Manan Dioswan igualchu."
"For example, the Bible records Jesus ’ own words: “The Father is greater than I am. ”" "Bibliapin tarinchis kikin Jesús kay nisqanta: “Yayaqa ñoqamanta aswan kurakmi ”, nispa."
"The Bible also says: “No man has seen God at any time. ”" "Bibliaqa nillantaqmi: “Manan pipas Diostaqa hayk’aqpas rikurqanchu ”, nispa."
"Jesus cannot be God because many people did in fact see Jesus." "Chhaynaqa Jesusqa manan Dioschu, Jesustaqa askha runakunan rikurqanku."
"Jesus ’ early followers did not claim that he was God." "Ñawpaq tiempopi cristianokunapas manan nirqankuchu “Jesusqa Diosmi ” nispa."
"For example, the Gospel writer John said concerning the things he recorded: “These have been written down that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God. ” ​ — John 20: 31."

"WASIKUNAPI kaq arañaq (Parasteatoda tepidariorum) llikanpiqa kanmi huk pegamento, chaywanmi perqakunapi llikanta allinta k’askachin, ichaqa pampapiqa lloqsipunanpaq hinallan k’askachin chhaynapi ratolla chayninta pasaqkunata hap’inanpaq."
"How does the spider produce both strong and weak anchors for its web with a single type of glue?" "¿Imaynatan chay araña huk pegamentollawan perqapi llikanta allinta k’askachin pampapitaq lloqsipunanpaq hinalla?"
"Scaffolding silk" "¿Imaynatan k’askachin?"
"Consider: The spider anchors its web to a wall, a ceiling, or a similar surface by weaving highly adhesive patches of silk called scaffolding discs, which are strong enough to withstand the impact of flying prey." "Chay arañaqa perqakunapi, wasikunaq techonpi hukkunapi iman llikanta k’askachin. Perqakunapi kaq llikanqa allin k’askachisqan kashan, chaymi huch’uy phalaq animalkuna chayman chocaspaqa mana urmachinchu."
"Researchers at the University of Akron, Ohio, U.S.A., have discovered that, on the other hand, the patches of silk that are attached to the ground ​ — called gumfoot discs — ​ have an entirely different architecture, or construction." "Ichaqa pampapiqa manan chhaynatachu llikanta k’askachin, chaytan Akron universidadmanta (Ohio, Estados Unidos) estudiaqkuna yacharqanku."
"With far fewer attachment points than scaffolding discs, gumfoot discs allow the web to detach with ease and yank off the ground any prey that has walked into it." "Pampapiqa karu - karullapin churan ruwasqan pegamentota, chaymi animalkuna chayman chocaqtinqa chay k’askachisqankuna lloqsipun hinaspan chay animaltaqa llikanwan hap’in."
"Gumfoot silk" "Pampapi k’askachisqa llika"
"According to a news release from the University of Akron, the researchers who uncovered this wonder of nature “are already working toward developing a synthetic adhesive that mimics this intelligent design strategy employed by the house spider. ”" "Akron universidadmanta chay arañaq ruwasqanmanta estudiaqkunaqa, “wasikunapi tiyaq arañaq ruwasqanta hinan huk pegamentota ruwayta munashanku ”."
"Scientists hope to create an adhesive that can be used both for common bandages and for treating bone fractures." "Chhaynapi kasqan pegamentollawan p’akisqa tullukunata churasqanku vendakunatapas k’askachinankupaq."
"What do you think?" "¿Ima ninkin chaymanta?"
"Did the house spider’s ability to produce weak and strong anchors with the same glue come about by evolution? Or was it designed?" "Wasikunapi kaq arañaqa huk pegamentollawanmi perqakunapi llikanta allinta k’askachin pampapitaq lloqsipunanpaq hinalla k’askachin, ¿kikillanmanta paqarimuspachu chayta ­ ruwanman, icha kamasqa kaspachu?"
"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"“Do not turn to the spirit mediums... so as to become unclean by them. ” ​ — Leviticus 19: 31." "“Amallataq layqamanpas rinkichischu, ama chaykunawan qhellichakunaykichispaq ” (Levítico 19: 31)"
"Understandably, people want reassurance that a dead loved one is not suffering." "Runakunaqa yachaytan munanku munakusqanku wañupuq runakuna ñak’arishankuchus icha manachus chayta."
"So they say: “Why not try to make contact with him or her by means of a spirit, or psychic, medium?" "Chayraykun ninku: “Huk layqaman risaq, payqa yanapawanqan wañupuqniywan rimanaypaq."
"Perhaps the medium can give us some sort of closure and peace of mind. ”" "Chhaynapiqa yaqapaschá thak sientekusaq ”, nispa."
"The Bible is clear concerning attempts by the living to contact the dead ​ — a practice that was common in ancient times." "Ñawpa tiempopipas runakunaqa rimaqkun wañusqakunawan, ichaqa Bibliaqa huchachanmi chay ruwayta."
"For example, Jehovah God’s Law to the nation of Israel said: “There should not be found in you anyone... who consults a spirit medium or... inquires of the dead." "Jehová Diosmi Israel nacionman kayta kamachirqan: “Aman qankuna ukhupiqa [...] mana allin espiritukunata rimachiqpas, wañuqpa alman rimachiqpas [...] kanqachu."
"For whoever does these things is detestable to Jehovah. ”" "Chay hina ruwaqkunataqa sinchitan Señor Diosqa cheqnikun ”, nispa (Deuteronomio 18: 10 - 12)."
"The Bible also states that those who practice spiritism in any of its forms “will not inherit God’s Kingdom. ” ​ — Galatians 5: 19 - 21." "Chaymantapas layqakuykunata ruwaqkunaqa “manan Diospa qhapaqsuyunman haykunqakuchu ”, chaytan Biblia willawanchis."
"“The living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all. ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 9: 5." "“Kawsashaqkunaqa yachankun wañukapunankuta, wañukapuqkunan ichaqa mana imatapas yachankuchu ” (Eclesiastés 9: 5)"
"Many claim that the dead live on in some form." "Askha runakunan piensanku “wañusqakunaqa maypipas kawsashanallankupaq ”."
"Hence, they may try to communicate with the dead, perhaps to obtain information or to appease the dead in hopes that they will leave the living in peace." "Chayraykun imatapas yachayta munaspaqa paykunata tapunku otaq mana dañota ruwachikuyta munaspa imatapas wañupuqkunapaq ruwapunku."
"“The living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all..." "“Kawsashaqkunaqa yachankun wañukapunankuta, wañukapuqkunan ichaqa mana imatapas yachankuchu [...]."
"Their love and their hate and their jealousy [all of which they felt while alive] have already perished. ”" "Munakuyninkupas cheqnikuyninkupas envidiakuyninkupas tukukapunñan ”, nispa (Eclesiastés 9: 5, 6)."
"Yes, the Bible teaches that the dead are just that ​ — dead! They cannot think, act, or even worship God." "Bibliaq nisqanman hinaqa wañusqakunaqa wañusqañan kapunku, manan imatapas piensankuñachu, manataqmi Diostapas serviyta atinkuñachu."
"“The dead do not praise [God]; nor do any who go down into the silence of death, ” says Psalm 115: 17." "Salmo 115: 17 textoq nisqanman hinaqa wañusqakunaqa manan Diosta yupaychankuchu."
"“Should [people] inquire of the dead in behalf of the living? ” ​ — Isaiah 8: 19." "“¿Wañusqakunatachu kawsaqkunamanta tapukunaykichis? ” (Isaías 8: 19, NM)"
"Some claim that spirit mediums are able to disclose information that only the dead and their family or friends could possibly know." "Wakinqa ninkun: “Layqakunaqa yachay munasqanchistan willawanchis, chaykunataqa wañuqpa familiankunallan, amigonkunallan yachanku ”, nispa."
"Chapter 28 of the book of 1 Samuel relates how an unfaithful king named Saul violated God’s command not to consult spirit mediums." "1 Samuel libropi 28 capitulopin willan rey Saúl layqaman risqanta, chayta ruwaspaqa Diospa kamachisqan contran ruwasharqan."
"He appealed to a medium, a woman who seemed to communicate with a deceased man of God named Samuel! But did she actually contact Samuel?" "Saulmi huk layqaman rispa valekurqan profeta Samuelwan rimananpaq, profeta Samuelqa Diospa kamachinmi karqan payqa wañusqañan kasharqan."
"No! She was, in fact, communicating with an impostor ​ — someone impersonating dead Samuel." "Ichaqa chay layqaqa manan Samuelwanchu rimachirqan, aswanpas hukmi Samuelpas kanman hina rimarqan."
"That impostor was a wicked spirit, an agent of “the father of the lie ” ​ — Satan." "Samuelpas kanman hina rimaqqa huk supaymi karqan, Satanaspa yanapaqnin, Satanastaqa Biblian sutichan ‘ llullakunaq taytan ’ nispa."
"Why do the wicked spirits, or demons, promote the view that the dead live on?" "Supaykunaqa runakunatan creechiyta munanku wañusqakuna kawsashallasqankuta, ¿imaraykun chayta ruwanku?"
"Their goal is to malign God and discredit his written Word, the Bible. ​ — 2 Timothy 3: 16." "Diostapas Simin Qelqantapas mana allinpi rikuchiyta munasqankurayku."
"Does the foregoing mean that the dead have no hope?" "Chhaynaqa, ¿manachu ima suyakuypas kan wañusqakunapaq?"
"Not at all!" "Manan chhaynachu."
"The Bible promises a future resurrection for those who are ‘ asleep, ’ as it were, in the grave." "Biblian willawanchis aya p’ampanakunapi kaqkuna kawsarimpunankuta, paykunaqa puñusqa hinallan kashanku."

"Think ahead." "Allinta yuyaykuy imakuna ruwanaykita."
"“If an iron tool is dull and one does not sharpen its edge, he will need to exert much effort, ” says Ecclesiastes 10: 10, adding:“ But wisdom helps to achieve success. ”" "Eclesiastés 10: 10 texton nin: “Hachachus molq’ayapun, manataq filoyachisqachu chayqa, aswan kallpawanmi waqtanqa, ichaqa yachaywan ruwaymi aswan allinqa ”, nispa."
"The lesson? Sharpen your ax, as it were, by planning ahead so that you can make the most effective use of your time." "Imaynan hachata manaraq utilizashaspa filoyachinanchis, chay hinallataqmi tiempota mana usuchinapaqqa ñawpaqmanta allinta yuyaykunanchis."
"Set aside or eliminate nonessential tasks, which do little more than consume time and energy." "Kallpata tiempota usuchiq ruwaykunataqa qhepamanña ruway otaq amañapas ruwayñachu."
"By thinking ahead, you increase your productivity, like a wise workman who sharpens his ax." "Ima ruwanaykitapas usqhaylla tukuspaqa huktañataq qallariy."
"Simplify your life. Learn to say no to things that are unimportant or that do little more than consume time. Too many activities and appointments can add needless stress and can rob you of joy." "Manaraq llank’ayta qallarishaspa hachanta filoyachiq runaqa astawanmi ruwan, chhaynallataqmi qanpas ñawpaqmantapacha qhawarinayki imakuna ruwanaykita, chhaynapin imaymanata ruwanaykipaq tiempoyki kanqa."
"Procrastination and indecision." "Ruwanakunawan ama hunt’achikuychu."
"“The one who watches the wind will not sow seed, and the one who looks at the clouds will not reap. ”" "Mana importante kaq ruwaykunata, tiempota usuchiq ruwaykunatapas ama ruwaychu."
"The lesson? Procrastination is a thief of both time and productivity." "Imaymanata ruwanaykipaq comprometekunki chayqa sayk’usqan sientekunki manataqmi kusisqachu kanki."
"A farmer who waits until conditions are perfect may never sow seed or reap his harvest." "Ama iskayaychu ima ruwanaykimantapas nitaq qhepamanña ruwanaykipaqpas saqeychu."
"Similarly, we could allow life’s uncertainties to make us indecisive." "“Wayrata qhawaqqa manan tarpunchu, phuyuta qhawaqpas manan cosechanchu ” (Eclesiastés 11: 4)."
"Or we may feel that we have to wait until we have every scrap of relevant information before making a decision." "Sichus huk runa allin tiempo kanantaraq suyanman chakrapi llank’ananpaq chayqa, yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas tarpunqachu nitaq cosechanqachu, aswanpas tiempollatan usuchinqa."
"To be sure, important decisions warrant research and deliberation. “The shrewd one ponders each step, ” says Proverbs 14: 15." "Chay hinallataqmi sichus imatapas ruwananchispaq iskayasunman chayqa manan hayk’aqpas qallariyta atisunchu, otaq imatapas decidinanchispaq lliwtaraq yachayta munasunman."
"But the reality is that many decisions involve some uncertainties. ​ — Ecclesiastes 11: 6." "Allin yuyayniyoq runa allintaña yuyaykun imatapas ruwananpaq chaypas, manan lliwtapunichu yachanqa (Proverbios 14: 15; Eclesiastés 11: 6)."
Perfectionism. "Ama nishuta llakikuychu ima ruwasqaykipas allinkama lloqsinanmanta."
"“The wisdom from above [or from God] is... reasonable, ” says James 3: 17." "Biblian nin: “Hanaqmanta [Diosmanta] hamuq yachayqa [...] allin yuyaywan reparaqmi ”, nispa."
"Of course, high standards are commendable!" "Imatapas allinta ruwaqtaqa “kusa ” nispan ninchis."
"Sometimes, though, we might set standards so high that we invite disappointment and even failure." "Ichaqa sichus nishuta llakikusun ima ruwasqanchispas allinkama lloqsinanmanta chayqa manan kusisqachu kasun ruwasqanchiswan."
"A person learning another language, for example, must be prepared to make mistakes, aware that he will learn from these." "Pipas huk mosoq simi rimayta yachashaspaqa pantanqapunin, chaykunaqa yanapanqan astawan yachananpaq."
"A perfectionist, however, would likely shudder at the thought of saying something incorrectly ​ — an attitude that would impede his progress." "Ichaqa imapas allinkama lloqsinanpaq nishuta llakikuq runaqa manchakunmi pantayta, chayqa manan yanapanchu astawan yachananpaq."
"How much better to be modest in our expectations!" "Manan suyananchischu ima ruwasqanchispas allinpipuni tukunantaqa."
"“Wisdom is with the modest ones, ” says Proverbs 11: 2." "Proverbios 11: 2 texton nin: “K’umuykukuqmi ichaqa yachayniyoq kapunqa ”, nispa."
"Moreover, the modest and humble do not take themselves too seriously and can usually laugh at themselves." "K’umuykukuq runakunaqa manan nishutaqa llakikunkuchu pantasqankumanta, mayninpiqa asikunkuraqmi pantasqankumanta."
"“You don’t really pay for things with money. You pay for them with time. ” ​ — What to Do Between Birth and Death" "“Manan qolqewanchu imatapas rantinki, aswanpas tiempoykiwanmi ” (Kusisqa kawsayta yachay, manan pipas qhawashasunkichu, español simipi)"
"Balance work and recreation." "Ama nishutaqa qokuychu llank’anaman otaq kusirikuyman."
"“Better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work and chasing after the wind. ” Workaholics often deprive themselves of the fruitage of their“ two handfuls of hard work. ”" "“Aswan allinmi pisi kaqllawan kusisqa kawsay askha kaqniyoq kaspa llakipakushaymantaqa ” (Eclesiastés 4: 6)."
"They simply have no time or energy left. The lazy, on the other hand, opt for “two handfuls ” of rest and squander precious time." "Llank’anaman qokuq runakunapaqqa manan tiemponpas kallpanpas kanchu allinkuna tarisqankuwan kusirikunankupaq."
"The Bible encourages a balanced view: Work hard and enjoy the rewards." "Qellakunapas samakuyllatan munanku, chhaynapin tiemponkuta usuchinku."
"Such rejoicing is “the gift of God. ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 5: 19." "Ichaqa manan llank’ayllamanqa qokunanchischu nitaq qellapas kananchischu, Biblian kallpachawanchis allinta llank’anapaq, llank’asqanchisrayku allinkuna tarisqanchiswan kusirikunanchistapas, “chayqa Diospa qosqanmi ” (Eclesiastés 5: 19)."
"Do not scrimp on sleep." "Allinta puñuy."
"“I will lie down and sleep in peace, ” said a Bible writer." "Bibliata qelqaq runan nirqan: “Mana manchapakuspa siriykuni, hinaspa puñukapuni ”, nispa (Salmo 4: 8)."
"Most adults need about eight hours of sleep a night to gain the full physical, emotional, and cognitive benefits." "Yaqa llapa runakunan pusaq horasta hina necesitanku puñuyta, chhaynapi cuerponkupas yuyayninkupas allin kananpaq."
"Concerning the latter, sleep is a sound investment of time because it aids in concentration and consolidates memories, thus fostering learning." "Puñuspaqa allintan tiemponchista utilizanchis, puñuyqa yuyayninchistan yanapan imatapas usqhaylla yachananchispaq."
"Sleep deprivation, however, impedes learning and contributes to accidents, errors, and irritability." "Mana puñusqa kaspan ichaqa accidentekuna kan, imata ruwaspapas pantanchismi, phiñasqallataqmi kanchispas."
"Set realistic goals." "Atinallaykita ruway."
"“Better to enjoy what the eyes see than to wander after one’s desires. ”" "“Aswan allinmi ñawiwan rikuyqa yuyayllapi munapakuymantaqa ” (Eclesiastés 6: 9)."
"The point?" "¿Imatan chaywan nishan?"
"A wise person does not let mere desires take the reins of his life, especially desires that may be unrealistic or impossible to satisfy." "Yachayniyoq runaqa manan munapayasqankunawan usqhayllachu aysachikun, astawanqa mana ruway atinapaq hina kaqtin."
"Hence, he is not seduced by clever advertising or easy credit." "Chayraykun mana engañachikunchu imaymanata munachiq propagandakunawan otaq manullapi imatapas rantinapaq propagandakunawan."
"Instead, he learns to be content with what he can actually attain ​ — “what [his] eyes see. ”" "Aswanpas ‘ ñawiwan rikuyta ’ atikuqkunallawanmi kusikun, chayqa imachus ruway atikuqkunan."
"Consider your values." "Imayna kasqaykita t’aqwikuy."
"Your values enable you to gauge what is good, important, and worthwhile. If your life were an arrow, your values would aim that arrow." "Allin ruwaykunaqa reparachiwanchismi imakuna aswan importante kasqanta, yanapawanchistaqmi kawsayninchis allin kananpaqpas."
"Good values, therefore, help you to set sound priorities in life and to make the very best use of your time hour by hour and day by day." "Yanapawallanchistaqmi importante ruwaykunata reparananchispaq tiemponchistapas mana usuchinanchispaq."
"Where can you find such values?" "¿Maypin allin ruwaykunamanta yachasunman?"
"Many people look to the Bible, recognizing its superior wisdom. ​ — Proverbs 2: 6, 7." "Askha runakunan Bibliapi yacharqanku, chaypi allin yachachikuykuna kasqanrayku (Proverbios 2: 6, 7)."
"Make love your foremost value." "Munakuq kay."
"Love “is a perfect bond of union, ” says Colossians 3: 14." "Munakuyqa “tukuy imatapas sumaqta hukllaman tukuchin ”, chaytan Colosenses 3: 14 texto nin."
"We cannot be truly happy and emotionally secure without love, especially within the family." "Familia ukhupi munakuy kaqtinqa llapallankun kusisqa, thakpi kawsanku."
"People who disregard that fact, perhaps giving priority to the pursuit of riches or a career, actually invest in unhappiness." "Ichaqa chayta saqespa qhapaq kaypi otaq profesional kaypi afanakuqkunaqa manan kusisqachu kawsankuman."
"Yes, for good reason the Bible makes love the preeminent value, mentioning it hundreds of times. ​ — 1 Corinthians 13: 1 - 3; 1 John 4: 8." "Chayraykun Bibliaqa askha kutita munakuymanta riman, nillantaqmi munakuy aswan importante kasqantapas."
"Set aside time to address your spiritual need." "Tiempota t’aqay Diosmanta yachanaykipaq."
"A man named Geoff had a loving wife, two happy children, good friends, and a rewarding job as a paramedic." "Geoff sutiyoq runan sumaqta kawsarqan esposanwan, iskay wawankunawan, amigonkunawan ima, hinaspapas ambulanciapi llank’aspan askha qolqeta ganarqan."
"Nevertheless, his work often brought him face - to - face with suffering and death." "Ichaqa llank’ananpin rikuqpuni runakuna ñak’arisqanta wañusqantapas."
"“Is this how life is supposed to be? ” he asked." "Chaymi tapukuqpuni: “¿Khaynapi tarikunanchispaqchu kawsanchis? ”, nispa."
"Then one day he read some Bible literature published by Jehovah’s Witnesses and found satisfying answers." "Huk p’unchaymi Jehová Diospa testigonkunaq qelqanta leerqan, chaypin yacharqan imarayku chhaynapi tarikusqanchista."
"Geoff explained what he was learning to his wife and children, and they too became interested. That started the family on a spiritual journey that enriched their lives and helped them to invest their time far more wisely." "Geoff runaqa chay qelqapi leesqantan esposanman wawankunaman ima willarqan, chaymi paykunapas Biblia estudiayta qallarirqanku, chay ruwasqankun yanaparqan tiemponkuta mana usuchispa allinta kawsanankupaq."
"Their study of the Bible also gave them the wonderful hope of everlasting life in a world free of futility and suffering. ​ — Revelation 21: 3, 4." "Hinaspapas paykunaqa huk mosoq pachapi wiñaypaq kawsaytan suyakushanku, chaypiqa manañan pipas ñak’arinqañachu."
"Geoff’s experience calls to mind the words of Jesus Christ, when he said: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need. ”" "Geoff runaq ruwasqanqa yuyarichiwanchismi Jesuspa nisqanta, nirqanmi: “Kusisamiyoqmi huch’uyyaykukuspa Diosta maskhaqkunaqa ”, nispa."
"Are you willing to set aside a little time to address your spiritual need?" "¿Kallpachakuwaqchu tiempota t’aqaspa Diosmanta yachanaykipaq?"
"To be sure, no other investment will give you the wisdom to make the most, not of just each day, but of your life as a whole." "Chayta ruwayqa yanapasunkin yachaywan ruwanaykipaq, chhaynapin sapa p’unchay kusisqa kawsanki."

"“The love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things. ” ​ — 1 Timothy 6: 10." "“Qolqe sonqo - kaymi tukuy mana allinkunaq saphinqa ” (1 Timoteo 6: 10)"
"Money is the root of all evil." "Qolqen tukuy mana allinkunata paqarichin."
"“The love of money ” ​ — not money itself — ​ causes“ injurious things. ”" "Manan qolqechu mana allinkunataqa rikhurichin, aswanpas “qolqe sonqo kaymi ”."
"In the Bible, wealthy King Solomon identified three kinds of injurious things that often happen to people who love money. Worry: “The plenty belonging to the rich one does not permit him to sleep. ”" "Biblian riman sinchi qhapaq Salomón reymanta, paymi rimarqan qolqe sonqokuna kinsa sasachakuykunapi tarikusqankumanta: Imaymanamantan llakikunku, Eclesiastés 5: 12 texton nin: ‘ Qhapaqtaqa [...] askha kaqninkunan mana puñuchinchu ’, nispa."

"Money makes you secure and happy." "Qolqeyoq kaspaqa thakmi kusisqa kawsanki."
"The myth that money buys happiness and security is part of “the deceptive power of riches. ” Still,“ money answers every need. ”" "Qolqeqa q’otukuqmi. Runakunaqa qolqewanmi sonqonkuta suwachikunku, paykunaqa piensankun qolqeyoq kaspaqa kusisqa thakpi kawsanankupaq, ichaqa chayqa yanqapunin."
"For example, money can buy the things you need to survive ​ — such as food and medicine. ​ — 2 Thessalonians 3: 12." "Chaywanpas qolqeqa imaymana sasachakuykunapin yanapawasunman (Eclesiastés 10: 19). Qolqewanmi rantiyta atisunman mikhunata hampikunatapas."
"Money also helps you to take care of your family." "Familiata uywanapaqpas yanapawanchismi."
"In fact, the Bible states: “If anyone does not provide for those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith. ” ​ — 1 Timothy 5: 8." "Biblian nin: “Pipas ayllunta mana yuyarinchu, aswantaqa familianta mana uywanchu chayqa, cheqaq iñiymantan t’aqakapun, mana iñiyniyoq runamantapas aswan millayraqmi kapun ”, nispa."

"To avoid the burden of living beyond your means, “let your way of life be free of the love of money. ” ​ — Hebrews 13: 5." "Kapuqnillanchiswan kawsaspaqa manan sasachakuykunapi tarikusunchu, chayraykun Biblia kayta niwanchis: “Ama qolqe sonqo kaychischu ”, nispa."
"Although the Bible does not condemn debt, it warns: “The borrower is a slave to the lender. ”" "Bibliaqa manan ninchu qolqemanta manupi kay hucha kasqanta, ichaqa willanmi manukuqqa manuqninpa kamachin kasqanta (Proverbios 22: 7)."
"Avoid impulse buying, because “all who are hasty surely head for poverty. ”" "Usqhaylla imapipas qolqeta gastayqa manan allinchu, Biblian nin: ‘ Usqhayllata qhapaqyayta munaqqa wakchayapunmi ’, nispa (Proverbios 21: 5)."
"Instead, “set something aside according to [your] own means ” and save money for what is important to you. ​ — 1 Corinthians 16: 2." "Ichaqa importante ruwaykunapaq qolqenchista huñuyqa allinpunin, chaytaqa atisqanchisman hinan ruwasunman."
"The Bible encourages us to “practice giving. ”" "Biblian yuyaychawanchis qoykukuq kananchispaq."
"People who want to please God have good reason to be generous, because “God loves a cheerful giver. ”" "Diosta kusichiyta munaqqa qoykukuqmi kanan, “Diosqa kusisqa qoqtan munakun ”."
"Therefore, “do not forget to do good and to share what you have with others, for God is well - pleased with such sacrifices. ” ​ — Hebrews 13: 16." "Chayrayku ‘ ama allinkaq ruwaytapas yanapakuytapas qonqaychischu, chay hina sacrificiokunawanmi Diosqa kusikun ’."

"CRYING accompanies us from the day we are born." "LLAPANCHISMI nacesqanchismantapacha waqanchis."
"One expert explains that as babies, crying became our “acoustic umbilical cord, ” because we cry to have our emotional and physical needs cared for." "Chaykunamanta yachaq runaq nisqanman hinaqa, wawakunaqa waqaspan imatapas mañakunku."

"“There are few other ways to say so much in such a brief interval, ” explains the book Adult Crying." "Imamantaña waqanchis chaypas, waqasqanchismi hukkunaman rikuchin imayna sientekusqanchista."

"For example, most of us find tears of sadness difficult to ignore because they alert us that someone is suffering." "(inglés simipi) nisqa libroq nisqan hinaqa waqaspan “imayna sientekusqanchista ratollan rikuchinchis ”."
"In response, we may try to comfort or help the one who weeps." "Chaymantapas llakikuymanta waqaqta rikuspaqa, reparanchismi mana allinpi tarikusqanta hinaspan yanapayta munanchis."

"Others argue that the physical or psychological benefits of crying have not been scientifically verified." "Wakintaq ichaqa ninku: “Cientificokunaqa manaraqmi allintachu yachanku waqay imapaqchus allin kasqanta ”, nispa."
"Nevertheless, surveys estimate that 85 percent of women and 73 percent of men reported feeling better after crying." "Ichaqa runakunata tapusqankupin pachak warmikunamanta 85 nirqanku waqasqanku qhepaman allin sientekusqankuta, pachak qharikunamantapas 73 kaqllatataq nirqanku."

"But this feeling of relief may depend not only on tears." "Ichaqa manan waqaspallachu thakqa sientekunchis."
"The way others respond to our crying also plays an important role." "Waqashaqtinchis hukkuna imayna tratawasqanchispas thaktan sientechiwanchis."

"Clearly, mysteries about crying remain." "Ichaqa kaytan sut’ita yachanchis: Runaqa waqaspan rikuchin imayna sientekusqanta, Diosmi chhaynata kamawarqanchis."
"What we do know is that shedding tears is one of the intriguing emotional responses God has given us. Newborn babies usually do not shed tears when they cry." "Yaqa lliw chayllaraq naceq wawakunaq ñawinkuqa allin cuidasqan kashan chaymi waqaqtinku weqenku mana lloqsinchu."
"They have enough moisture to protect their eyes, but tears appear after several weeks when their tear ducts develop fully." "Ichaqa askha semanakuna qhepamanmi weqenku lloqsimun, maynintachus weqe lloqsimunan allinña kaqtin."

"What would I think of someone who posted such a comment or photo? ​ — Bible principle: Proverbs 10: 23." "(Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Proverbios 22: 3.)"
"Teach your teen to live by values ​ — not just rules." "Yachachiy allin reparaq kananpaq."
"You cannot look over your teenager’s shoulder every moment of the day." "Wawaykiq lliw ruwasqantaqa manan controlayta atiwaqchu."
"Besides, your goal as a parent is not to control your children but to help them “have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong. ”" "Chayraykun yachachinayki “allinkaqta mana allinkaqta reparayta ”."
"So, instead of emphasizing rules and punishment as the primary factor, appeal to your teenager’s moral sense." "Ama wawaykitaqa kaykunallatachu niy: “Kaytaqa ama ruwaychu ”,“ Chayta ruwanki chayqa castigasaykin ”, nispa, aswanpas yachachiy allin reparaq kananpaq."

"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"“I will meditate on all your activity and ponder over your dealings. ” ​ — Psalm 77: 12." "“Tukuy ruwasqankunapin yuyaymanasaq, ruwasqankunatan yuyarisaq ” (Salmo 77: 12)"
"Meditation takes many forms, a number of which have roots in ancient Eastern religions." "Runakunaqa imaymanatan ruwanku “kaymi yuyaymanay ” nispa. Wakinqa huk religionkunaq ruwasqankutan qatikunku."
"“The mind has to be empty to see clearly, ” said one writer on the subject." "Huk qelqaq runa chaymanta nirqan: “Yuyayniykiqa ch’usaq kanan, manan imapipas piensanaykichu ”, nispa."
"His words reflect the view that emptying the mind while focusing on certain words or images promotes inner peace, mental clarity, and spiritual enlightenment." "Chay runa hinan wakinqa ninku “sichus yuyayniyki ch’usaq kanqa wakin simikunallapitaq otaq dibujokunallapitaq piensanki chayqa thakmi sientekunki ” nispa."
"The Bible puts a high value on meditation." "Bibliaqa kallpachawanchismi yuyaymanananchispaq (Josué 1: 8)."
"The kind of meditation that it encourages, however, does not entail emptying the mind or repeating a certain word or phrase, sometimes called a mantra." "Ichaqa manan niwanchischu “yuyayniykin ch’usaq kanan otaq huk simita thawtispan kanayki ” (mantra) nispaqa."
"Rather, Biblical meditation involves purposeful thinking on wholesome topics, such as God’s qualities, standards, and creations." "Aswanpas Bibliaqa yuyaymanaymanta rimaspaqa allin kaqkunapi allinta yuyaykuymantan rimashan, wakinqa kanman Diospa kamachikuyninkunapi, kamasqankunapi, imayna Dios kasqanpipas."
"“I meditate on all your activity; I eagerly ponder over the work of your hands, ” prayed a faithful man of God." "Diospa huknin siervonmi nirqan: “Tukuy ruwasqaykikunatan yuyaymanani, makiykiq ruwasqankunatan qhawarini ”, nispa (Samo 143: 5)."
"He also said: “I remember you while upon my bed; I meditate on you during the watches of the night. ” ​ — Psalm 63: 6." "Nillarqantaqmi: “Puñuykuspaymi yuyariyki, tutakunapin yuyaymanayki ”, nispa (Salmo 63: 6)."
"“The heart of the righteous one meditates before answering. ” ​ — Proverbs 15: 28." "“Chanin runaqa allintan yuyaykun kutichinanpaq ” (Proverbios 15: 28)"
"Wholesome meditation gives us inner depth, quiet reserve, and moral strength ​ — all of which add insight and understanding to our speech and behavior." "Bibliaq nisqanman hina yuyaymanasun chayqa, aswan allin runamanmi tukupusun, imatapas ruwananchispaq kallpachasqa sientekusun, caracterninchispas allinmi kanqa."
"Such meditation, therefore, also contributes to a happy and rewarding life." "Chaykunataq yanapawasun allin yuyaywan imatapas rimananchispaq ruwananchispaq ima (Proverbios 16: 23)."
"Concerning the person who regularly meditates on God, Psalm 1: 3 states: “He will be like a tree planted by streams of water, a tree that produces fruit in its season, the foliage of which does not wither." "Hinaspapas kusisqan kawsasunchis, Diospi yuyaymanaq runamantan Salmo 1: 3 texto nin: “Payqa mayu patapi sach’a hinan, tiempollanpi ruruq sach’a hinan, raphinpas q’omerllapunin kashan."
"And everything he does will succeed. ”" "¡Imapas ruwasqanqa allillanpunin! ”, nispa."
"Meditation also helps us to improve our comprehension and memory." "Chaymantapas yuyaymanayqa yanapawanchismi allin entiendeq kananchispaq, yachasqanchista umallanchispi hap’inanchispaqpas."
"To illustrate, when we study an aspect of creation or a certain Bible topic, we learn many interesting facts." "Kaywan entiendesun: Bibliata otaq Diospa kamasqankunata estudiaspaqa imaymanatan yachanchis."
"But when we meditate on those facts, we see how they relate to one another and to what we have learned in the past." "Ichaqa chaykunapi yuyaymanasun chayqa, reparasunmi imaynatachus chaykuna ñawpaq yachasqanchiskunawan tupasqanta."
"Thus, just as a carpenter turns raw materials into an attractive building, meditation enables us to “assemble ” facts into a coherent pattern or structure." "Wasita hatarichiqkunaqa ladrillokunatan cementowan k’askachinku, chay hinatan sichus sapanka estudiasqanchispi yuyaymanasun chayqa aswan yachayniyoq kapusun."
"“The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate." "“Runaq sonqonqa tukuy imamantapas aswan q’otukuqmi, millay ruwaqtaq kanpas, ¿pitaq chay sonqotari reqsinman? ”"
"Who can know it? ” ​ — Jeremiah 17: 9." "(Jeremías 17: 9)"
"“From inside, out of the heart of men, come injurious reasonings, sexual immorality, thefts, murders, acts of adultery, greed, acts of wickedness, deceit, brazen conduct, an envious eye,... and unreasonableness. ”" "“Runakunaq sonqonmantaqa lloqsimun: mana allin yuyaykuna, wasanchaykuna, qhelli huchapi puriykuna, runa wañuchiykuna, suwakuykuna, munapakuykuna, millay kaykuna, q’otuykuna, mana p’enqarikuykuna [...], mana yuyayniyoq kaykunapiwan ”."
"Yes, like a fire, meditation must be controlled! Otherwise, improper thoughts could nurture hurtful desires that might race out of control and lead to evil deeds. ​ — James 1: 14, 15." "Ima yuyaykusqanchispas ninamanmi rikch’akun, sichus mana controlasunchu chayqa millay kaqkunapin yuyaymanayta qallarisunman hinaspataq huchaman urmasunman."
"Accordingly, the Bible encourages us to meditate on ‘ things that are true, righteous, pure, lovable, well - spoken - of, virtuous, and praiseworthy. ’" "Chayraykun Bibliaqa kallpachawanchis “tukuy cheqaqkaqpi, tukuy allinkaqpi, tukuy chaninkaqpi, tukuy ch’uyakaqpi, tukuy sumaqkaqpi, tukuy allin qhawarinapaq kaqpi ” ima yuyaykunanchispaq."
"When we take in such fine thoughts and “sow ” them in our mind, we will reap in the form of beautiful qualities, gracious speech, and warm relationships with others. ​ — Colossians 4: 6." "Sichus allin kaqkunallapi yuyaykusun chayqa allin runamanmi tukupusun, rimayninchisqa ancha sumaqmi kanqa, hukkunawanpas allintan kawsasun."

"Her message sounded like a desperate plea for attention." "Payqa usqhaylla yanapanankutan necesitarqan."
"Although the woman had more than a thousand social network “friends ” online, not one came to her aid." "Internetpi amigonkuna waranqanpiña karqan chaypas, manan pipas paytaqa yanaparqanchu."
"The police found her body a day later." "Qhepa p’unchaytan policiakuna wañusqata payta tarirqanku."
"She had taken a fatal overdose." "Chay warmiqa nishuta drogakuspan wañusqa."
"Today, modern technology allows us to make hundreds, or even thousands, of social network “friends ” by merely adding their names to our list of computer contacts." "Kay tiempopiqa internet kasqanwanmi runakunaqa waranqanpi amigokunata tarinku."
"And when we wish to end one of these “friendships, ” we simply delete that person’s name from our list." "Pipas amigon kananpaqqa sutillantan correo nisqapi qelqanku, manaña amigon kananpaqtaq sutillanta picharqapunku."
"However, the tragic incident involving the woman in Britain underscores a startling reality ​ — true friendship still eludes many." "Ichaqa Gran Bretaña nacionmanta warmita imachus sucedesqanmi kayta reparachiwanchis: Pisi runakunallan cheqaq amigokunayoqqa kanku."
"In fact, one recent survey revealed that although we are socializing more, the number of our truly close friends has decreased." "Huk encuestaq nisqanman hina, runakunaqa askha runakunataña reqsinku chaypas pisillan cheqaq amigokunayoqqa kanku."

"Consider the following four guiding principles, and note how the Bible’s practical advice can help you to be the kind of person others would want as a friend." "Yachasun Bibliaq yachachisqan tawa yanapaykunamanta, chaykunan yanapasunki allin amigo kanaykipaq."
"In other words, a good friend feels a responsibility toward you, and he really cares about you." "Allin amigo kananchispaqqa hukkunaq allinnintan astawanqa maskhananchis."
"Of course, such commitment is two - way, and it requires hard work and sacrifice on both sides. But the rewards are worth the effort." "Ichaqa piwanpas amigo kaspaqa manan hukllachu chayta ruwanan, aswanpas iskayninkun kallpachakunanku huk ruwaykunata saqesparaq yanapanakunankupaq."

"Practice giving, and people will give to you. ” Here Jesus recommends true unselfishness and generosity." "“Imaynatachus qankunapaq runakunaq ruwananta munankichis, chay hinallatataq qankunapas paykunapaq ruwaychis ”."

"Basically, their friendship began to unravel when they took several wrong steps: (1) Jerry was inconsiderate, (2) Frank expressed his annoyance in a way that upset Jerry, (3) both lost their temper, and (4) both refused to yield. In time, however, reason prevailed." "Iskayninkupas mana allinta ruwasqankurayku: 1) Jorgeqa manan wasimasinkunapi piensarqanchu; 2) Luisqa phiñasqan Jorgewan rimarqan, chaymi Jorgeta phiñachirqan; 3) Iskayninkupas phiñakuywanmi atipachikurqanku; 4) Manan mayqenninkupas allichayta munarqanchu."

"The principles involved can be found in the world’s most widely distributed book ​ — the Bible." "Chay yachachikuykunaqa Bibliapin tarikun, chay libron yanapawanchis allin yuyaykuq kananchispaq, sumaq sonqo kananchispaq, munakuq pacienciayoq ima kananchispaqpas."
"It encourages us to cultivate qualities that promote peace and heal emotional wounds ​ — qualities such as discernment, insight, kindness, love, and patience. ​ — Proverbs 14: 29; 1 Corinthians 13: 4, 5." "Chayna kayqa yanapawanchismi hukkunawan thakpi kawsanapaq, sonqonchispi k’irisqa kasqanchistapas thanichinmi (Proverbios 14: 29; 1 Corintios 13: 4, 5)."
"Frank and Jerry are just two examples of the Bible’s power to change lives for the better." "Bibliaqa atiyniyoqmi runakunaq kawsayninta cambiananpaq, chaymi Luistawan Jorgetawan yanaparqan."
"There are many other examples, including people who overcame deeply entrenched negative traits." "Wakin runakunapaqqa sinchi sasan caracterninkuta cambiay, ichaqa paykunatapas Bibliaqa yanaparqanmi."
"For instance, Robert, who lives in Australia, overcame deep - seated anger. Nelson, in Timor - Leste, cast aside long - standing animosity and made a close friend of a former enemy."

"During my teens, I spent two years in a reform school." "Taytayqa sinchi k’araq sonqo kasqanraykun maqakuq karqan."
"Later, I committed a brutal assault that landed me in a maximum - security prison." "Mayninpiqa desmayanaykaman maqawaq, yawarkamallatañan saqewaq, chayraykun ñoqapas sinchi maqakuq karqani."
"When I was finally released, I moved to Australia, hoping for a fresh start." "Wayna kashaqtiyqa, waynakunapaq carcelmanmi apawarqanku chhaynapi cambianaypaq."

"It was not so much the move that changed me but the Bible, which I studied with Jehovah’s Witnesses." "Robertoqa wayna kashaspan sinchi maqakuq karqan, carcelmanpas haykurqanmi"
"That said, I still struggled to control my temper and often felt frustrated and worthless." "Chaywanpas k’araq sonqo kasqaywanmi atipachikuqraq kani, chaymi mana valeqpaq qhawarikurqani."
"Then one day I reflected on Proverbs 19: 11, which says: “The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger, and it is beauty on his part to overlook an offense. ”" "Huk kutinmi yuyaymanarqani Proverbios 19: 11 textopi, ninmi: “Runaq allin yuyayniyoq - kayninqa phiñakuytan hark’an, k’amiqninta hinallata qhawaqqa hatunchasqan kanqa ”, nispa."
"Eager to develop that insight, I began to think about what lies behind our feelings, words, and deeds." "Ñoqaqa munarqanin allin yuyayniyoq kayta, chaymi yachayta munarqani imarayku mayninpi comunta rimarparisqanchista, phiñakusqanchista, mana allinta ruwasqanchistapas."
"As a result, I gradually became more understanding, patient, and forgiving." "Pisi - pisimantan yacharqani entiendeq kayta, pacienciayoq kayta, mana phiñakuq kaytapas."
"Would you give us an example?" "¿Imaynatan chaykunata rikuchirqanki?"
"I once upset a friend unintentionally, and he angrily rebuked me in front of others." "Huk kutinmi amigoyta phiñachirqani, hinan runaq ñawpaqenpi chay ruwasqayta niwarqan."
"I was humiliated, to say the least!" "¡Ñoqaqa sinchi p’enqaypin qheparqani!"

"But I’ve learned a lot from the Bible, including the importance of saying, “I’m sorry. ”" "Ichaqa Bibliapin imaymanata yacharqani, hinallataq pampachay mañakuytapas."
"It’s amazing how those words, when sincerely expressed, can prevent or defuse a conflict." "Sonqomantapuni “pantarunin, pampachaway ” nispa niyqa, phiñachinakuykunatan thasnun, yanapawanchistaqmi aswan facilta problemakunata allichanapaqpas."

"What motivated you to change?" "¿Imaraykun cambiapurqanki?"
"I began to study the Bible and to apply its teachings, two of which especially touched my heart." "Nelsonqa huk político grupopi karqan, chayqa gobiernoq contranpin karqan"
"The first states: “All things... that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them. ”" "Mateo 7: 12 textopin nin: “Imaynatachus runakunaq ruwanasuykichista munankichis, chhaynallatataq qankunapas paykunata ruwaychis ”, nispa."
"The second reads: “You must love your neighbor as yourself. ”" "Mateo 22: 39 textopitaqmi nin: “Runamasiykitan qan kikiykita hina munakunki ”, nispa."
"I observed that the Witnesses, who taught me the Bible, displayed that kind of love, regardless of their racial or ethnic background. I wanted to be like them." "Ñoqaqa paykuna hina kaytan munarqani; ñawpaqpiqa manchakunapaqmi karqani, kunanmi ichaqa manaña manchakuwankuñachu, chhayna cambiasqaytaqa sut’itan hukkunaqa reparanku."
"Evidently, I succeeded, for my old acquaintances were amazed and soon no longer feared me." "¿Qhepakunapi atipachikurqankiraqchu k’araq sonqo kayniykiwan?"
"Did you ever have a relapse? Not in public." "Runakunaq kasqanpiqa manañan, wasiypin ichaqa mayninpi atipachikuqraq kani."
"But sometimes I struggled to control my temper at home." "Huk kutinmi k’araqta phiñakurqani, hinan esposayta maqarqani."
"In fact, I once got angry and hit my wife, which I deeply regret." "¡Maytan pesapakuni chay ruwasqaymanta!"
"She kindly forgave me, though, and this made me even more determined to master my emotions." "Payqa pampachawarqanmi, chaytaqmi kallpachawarqan caracterniyta cambiashanallaypaq."
"You said that people stopped fearing you." "Kunanqa manañan manchakusunkikuñachu."
"Can you give us an example? Yes." "¿Imaynapin chayta repararqanki?"
"One day I encountered a prominent member of the rival political group that I mentioned earlier, a man named Augusto." "Político t’aqapi kashaqtiyqa chaypin huk importante runa karqan, Augusto sutiyoq, huk kutinmi paywan tuparqani."
"At first, he was very cautious." "Payqa manchan - manchan hinan kasharqan, ñoqan ichaqa sumaq simiwan napaykurqani."
"But I greeted him warmly, suggested that we forget our differences, and invited him to my home." "Nirqanin ñawpaqpi pasasqankunata qonqapunaykupaq, wasiyman hamunanpaqmi invitarqani, payqa munarqanmi hamuyta."
"He accepted my offer and was amazed at the changes I had made ​ — so much so that he too began to study the Bible." "Admirakurqanmi kawsayniyta cambiasqaymanta, hinan paypas Bibliata estudiarqan."
"Now Augusto and I are not just close friends but also spiritual brothers." "Kunanqa Augustowanqa amigontinmi kayku, iñiqmasiytaqmi kapunpas."
"The causes of conflict are complex and varied, and not everyone is eager to respond to overtures of peace." "Imaymanamantan runaqa phiñachinakun, wakinqa sasa allichaymi kanman. Chaymantapas manan llapa runakunachu allipunayta munanku."
"Hence, the Bible offers this realistic advice: “If possible, as far as it depends on you, be peaceable with all men. ” ​ — Romans 12: 18." "Chayraykun Bibliaqa sut’ita kayta niwanchis: “Atisqaykichisman hina allinllatapuni ruwaychis llapa runawan sumaqpi kawsanaykichispaq ”, nispa."
"The people mentioned in this article are living proof that the wisdom found in the Bible really works ​ — that it has the power to overturn even “strongly entrenched ” negative attitudes when we let it." "¿Imatan reparanchis chaykuna yachasqanchispi? Bibliapi consejokunaqa yachaywan ruwasqan kashan, chaykunaqa manan yanqachu; runakunapaqña sasa kanman caracterninkuta cambiay chaypas, Bibliaq yanapayninwanqa atinkun cambiayta."
"Concerning that wisdom, Proverbs 3: 17, 18 says: “Its ways are pleasant, and all its paths are peaceful." "Proverbios 3: 17, 18 texton nin: “Yachayqa sumaq ñanninkunatan pusasunki, payqa thak - kaypin kawsachisunki."
"It is a tree of life to those who take hold of it, and those who keep firm hold of it will be called happy. ” Nelson and Augusto are now good friends" "Yachayqa kawsay sach’a hinan chayta chaskikuqkunapaqqa, kusisamiyoqmi yachayman k’askakuqkunaqa ”, nispa."
"Do you want to become more happy and peaceable?" "¿Munawaqchu llanp’u sonqo kayta kusisqa kaytapas?"
"Do you long for friendships that will not unravel when put to the test?" "¿Munawaqchu problemapi tarikushaqtiyki amigoykikuna ama saqerparinasuykikuta?"
"If so, you will not be disappointed if you allow the Bible to show you the way." "Biblian yanapasunki chaykunapi. Nelsonwan Augustowanqa amigontinmi kapunku"
"Names have been changed." "Sutikunaqa cambiasqan kashan."
"Think before you speak or act. ​ — James 1: 19." "Manaraq rimashaspa allinta yuyaykuy"
"When provoked, do not retaliate. ​ — Proverbs 26: 20." "Pipas phiñachisuqtiykiqa ama vengakuychu (Proverbios 26: 20)"
"If anger wells up, “take your leave. ” ​ — Proverbs 17: 14." "Phiñakuywan amaraq atipachikushaspa ayqerikuy (Proverbios 17: 14)"
"“Love is patient and kind." "Pampachayta mañakuy"
"Love is not jealous." "Sonqomanta pampachay"
"It does not brag, does not get puffed up, does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury.... It bears all things,... endures all things. Love never fails. ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 13: 4 - 8." "“Pipas munakuqqa muchukuqllan, sumaq sonqollan, munakuqqa manan envidiakunchu, manan k’ankaykachanchu, manan hatunchakunchu, manan mana ruwanakunatachu ruwan, manan payllapaq kanantachu munan, manan phiñakunpachachu, manan sientepakunchu [...], tukuy imapin pacienciakun ”"
"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"“[God’s prophet] Daniel saw a dream... as he lay on his bed." "“[Diospa profetan] Danielqa puñushaspa mosqokurqan [...]."
"Then he wrote down the dream; he recorded a complete account of the matters. ” ​ — Daniel 7: 1." "Rikch’arispataq mosqokusqankunata qelqarqan ” (Daniel 7: 1)"
"God has conveyed important messages to people in a variety of ways." "Diosqa runakunamanqa willaqmi importante willakuykunata."
"In Bible times, he occasionally used dreams." "Ñawpa tiempopiqa mosqoykunapin mayninpi chayta willaq."
"But these were not everyday vague, illogical dreams." "Ichaqa chay mosqoykunaqa manan puñuspa mosqokusqanchispi hina mana entiendenachu karqan."
"Dreams from God were vivid and coherent, and they had a definite message." "Diosmanta hamuq mosqoykunaqa entiendekuqmi, sut’itan reparakuq imatachus Diospa willasqan."
"For example, in a dream, the prophet Daniel saw a series of beasts that symbolize political empires from Babylon down to our time." "Danielqa huk mosqoypin rikurqan manchakunapaq animalkunata, chaykunaqa atiyniyoq gobiernokunawanmi tuparqan (Daniel 7: 1 - 3, 17)."
"By means of a dream, God told Joseph of Nazareth, the adoptive father of Jesus, to flee to Egypt with his wife and child." "Diosqa huk mosqoypin Joseman willarqan familianpiwan Egiptoman ayqekunanpaq."
"As a result, Jesus escaped death at the hands of vicious King Herod." "Chhaynapin Jesusqa mana wañuchisqachu karqan rey Herodeswan."
"When Herod died, God disclosed his death to Joseph by means of a dream, at the same time instructing him to return with his family to their homeland. ​ — Matthew 2: 13 - 15, 19 - 23." "Chay rey wañupusqan qhepamanmi Diosqa huk mosqoypi Joseman willallarqantaq llaqtanman kutipunanpaq."
"“Do not go beyond the things that are written. ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 4: 6." "“Diospa Simin Qelqaq nisqanmantaqa manan astawan yuyaykunaykichischu ” (1 Corintios 4: 6)"
"The dreams recorded in the Bible form part of God’s written revelation to mankind." "Diosqa manan mosqoykunallapichu runakunaman willarqan, hukniraykunamantapas willarqanmi."
"Concerning that revelation, 2 Timothy 3: 16, 17 states: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, so that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work. ”" "Chaykunamantan 2 Timoteo 3: 16, 17 texto nin: “Diospa Simin Qelqakunaqa llapallanmi Diospa yuyaychasqan, chayraykun allinpuni yachachinapaq, anyanapaq, wanachinapaq, chanin kawsayta yachachinapaq."
"The Bible ‘ completely equips ’ us in that it reveals all that we need to know about God, his qualities, his moral standards, and our place in his purpose for the earth." "Ahinapin Dios sonqo runaqa allin yachachisqa kanqa, tukuy allin kaqkunata ruwananpaqpas allin - allin wakichisqa ”, nispa."
"Hence, God no longer uses dreams to convey messages to humans." "¿Imakunatan Biblia allin - allinta willawanchis?"
"If we want to learn about the future and God’s will for us, we need “not go beyond the things that are written ” ​ — that is, written in the Bible." "Willawanchismi Diosmanta yachay munasqanchiskunata, kamachikuyninkunata, kay pachapaq imatachus ruway munasqantapas."
"Moreover, virtually all mankind can access this book and study its many revelations from God, including dreams." "Chayraykun kunanqa manaña mosqoykunawanchu willawanchis. Kunanqa Bibliapin tarikun hamuq tiempomanta willakuykuna Diospa munayninkunapas."
"“Men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit. ” ​ — 2 Peter 1: 21." "“Paykunaqa Santo Espirituq yuyaychasqan kaspan Diosmanta rimarqanku ” (2 Pedro 1: 21)"
"Many of the dreams and visions recorded in the Bible were prophetic ​ — that is, they foretold future events." "Bibliapi tarikuq mosqoykunapas rikhuriykunapas yaqa llapanmi profeciakuna karqan, chaykunaqa imachus sucedenan kaqkunatan willarqan."
"By recording these prophecies, the Bible writers put their credibility ​ — and that of the Scriptures — ​ on the line." "Chay profeciakunaq kasqanwanmi sut’ita yachasunman Bibliata qelqaqkuna sut’itachus willarqanku icha manachus chayta."
"Did their writings prove to be accurate?" "¿Hunt’akurqanchu chay profeciakuna?"
"Consider an example ​ — the vision found at Daniel 8: 1 - 7, recorded toward the end of the Babylonian Empire. Using symbolism, the prophecy involved a ram and a male goat that overthrew the ram, trampling it down." "Chaypaq t’aqwisun Daniel 8: 1 - 7 textota, chaypin willashan manaraq Babilonia atipasqa kashaqtin Danielpa rikhuriypi rikusqankuna."
"Daniel did not have to guess at the meaning of the vision." "Danielmi rikurqan huk orqo cabra huk anejota atipasqanta."
"An angelic messenger of God declared: “The two - horned ram... stands for the kings of Media and Persia." "Danielqa manan watunanchu karqan chaytaqa, Diospa huk angelninmi sut’incharqan, nirqanmi: “Iskay waqrayoq anejo rikusqaykiqa Media suyu Persia suyu reykunan."
"The hairy male goat stands for the king of Greece. ”" "Orqo cabraqa Grecia suyu reymi ”, nispa (Daniel 8: 20, 21)."
"History confirms that Medo - Persia succeeded Babylon as a world power. Then, some two hundred years later, Medo - Persia fell to Alexander the Great of Greece." "Runakunaqa sut’itan yachanku Babilonia atipasqa kasqan qhepaman Medopersia atiyniyoq kapusqanta. 200 watakuna hina qhepamanmi Medopersia suyuta Grecia suyu atiparqan, Alejandro Magno runataqmi chaypi umallirqan."
"Such amazing accuracy characterizes Bible prophecy, including prophetic dreams." "Danielpa rikusqan k’apakta hunt’akusqanmi reparachiwanchis Bibliapi profeciakuna confianapaqpuni kasqanta."
"This fact alone sets the Bible apart from all other sacred books, making it worthy of our confidence." "Chaywanmi yachanchis huk librokunamanta aswan allin kasqanta."
"Violence against women has become a “global public health problem of epidemic proportions, ” according to the World Health Organization (WHO)." "Organización Mundial de la Salud nisqan willan warmikuna maltratay “huk onqoy hina pachantinpi astawan yapakushasqanta ”."
"“Some 35% of all women will experience either intimate partner or non - partner violence, ” says WHO.“ Intimate partner violence is the most common type..., affecting 30% of women worldwide. ”" "Ninmi: “Pachakmantan 35 warmikuna qosankuq otaq hukkunaq maltratasqanpuni kanqaku [...], warmikunaqa astawanqa qosankuq maltratasqanmi kanku, pachantinpiqa chhaynapin tarikunku pachakmanta 30 warmikuna ”, nispa."
"In a poll of 64,303 people, 79 percent thought that “religion is a cause of much misery and conflict in the world today. ” Moreover, a 2011 census of England and Wales found that only 59 percent of the population profess to be Christian, down from 72 percent in 2001. During the same period, the percentage of people who claimed no religious affiliation rose from 15 to 25." "303 runakunamanta 50.800 runakuna nirqanku: “Religionkuna kasqanraykun ñak’ariykunapas maqanakuykunapas kan ”, nispa. 2001 watapin Inglaterra Gales llaqtakunapi yachakurqan pachakmanta 72 runakuna cristiano kasqankuta, 2011 watapin ichaqa pachakmanta 59 runakunalla. 2001 watapiqa pachakmantan 15 runakuna karqanku mana religionniyoq, 2011 watapaqmi ichaqa pachakmanta 25 runakuna."

"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"“O Hearer of prayer, to you people of all sorts will come. ” ​ — Psalm 65: 2." "“Qanqa mañakusqatan uyarinki, llapa runan hamusunkiku ” (Salmo 65: 2)"
"It has been said that prayers seem to “rise no higher than the ceiling. ”" "Wakinqa ninkun: “Mañakusqaykitaqa manan pipas uyarinchu ”, nispa."
"People undergoing suffering may especially be prone to doubt that their prayers are heard." "Wakin runakunaqa ñak’arispankun tapukunku: “¿Pillapas uyariwanmanchu mañakusqayta? ”, nispa."
"“The eyes of Jehovah [God] are on the righteous, and his ears listen to their supplication, but the face of Jehovah is against those doing bad things, ” says the Bible." "“Señorqa chanin runakunatan qhawashan, mañakusqankutapas makillan uyarishan."
"Clearly, God does listen to prayers." "Ichaqa mana allin ruwaqkunaq contranpin kashan ”."
"He is, however, especially inclined to listen to those who follow his precepts." "Chaywanmi yachanchis Diosqa mañakusqanchista uyarisqanta, astawanqa payta kasukuqkunaq mañakusqanta."
"Regarding God’s willingness to hear us when we pray, another scripture states: “This is the confidence that we have toward him, that no matter what we ask according to his will, he hears us. ”" "Askha kutipin Biblia willawanchis Jehová * Diosqa mañakusqanchista uyariy munasqanta, 1 Juan 5: 14 texton nin: “Ñoqanchisqa [...] allintapuni yachanchis, munayninman hina imatapas Diosmanta mañakuqtinchisqa pay uyariwananchista ”, nispa."
"Hence, sincere supplicants need to understand what types of request are likely to harmonize with God’s will." "Diosman qayllaykuq runaqa Diospa munasqanman hinan mañakunan."
"“When praying, do not say the same things over and over again. ” ​ — Matthew 6: 7." "“Mañakushaspaqa ama mana iñiqkuna hina thawtiychischu ” (Mateo 6: 7)"
"Adherents of various religions ​ — such as Buddhism, Catholicism, Hinduism, and Islam — ​ have been taught to use beads to recite and count their prayers." "Budismo, católico, hinduismo, islam religionkunapiqa yachachinkun rezasqankuta yupanankupaq, chaypaqmi utilizanku bolachakunayoq collarta."
"Prayers should spring from the heart and be expressed with sincerity; they should not be learned by rote and repeated mechanically." "Diosmanta mañakusqanchisqa sonqomantan lloqsinan, manan grabadora hinachu kaqllata sapa kuti ninanchis."
"The Scriptures urge us: “When praying, do not say the same things over and over again as the people of the nations do, for they imagine they will get a hearing for their use of many words." "Biblian niwanchis: “Mañakushaspaqa ama mana iñiqkuna hina thawtiychischu, paykunaqa warararasqankuwanmi Diospa uyarisqan kayta yuyanku. Amayá qankunaqa paykuna hinachu kaychis."
"So do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need even before you ask him. ” ​ — Matthew 6: 7, 8." "Yayaykichisqa manaraq mañakushaqtiykichismi yachanña imakunatachus necesitasqaykichista ”, nispa."
"When prayers are offered in a manner not acceptable to God, the worshipper may well be wasting his time or possibly offending God." "Diospa mana chaskisqan mañakuykunata ruwayqa tiempo usuchiymi, Diostapas phiñachinchismi."
"The Bible warns that prayers offered by those who refuse to comply with God’s will are “detestable ” to him. ​ — Proverbs 28: 9." "Diosqa millakunmi mana kasukuyta munaq runakunaq mañakusqanta (Proverbios 28: 9)."
"“Search for Jehovah [God] while he may be found. Call to him while he is near. ” ​ — Isaiah 55: 6." "“Señor Diosta maskhaychis tarinaraq kashaqtin, payta waqyakuychis qayllallapiraq kashaqtin ” (Isaías 55: 6)"
"Some believers pray to Mary or to other entities, such as angels and individuals, who are revered as “saints. ” Among these are“ Saint ” Anthony of Padua, who is said to look after “both spiritual and temporal needs, ” and“ Saint ” Jude, who is considered to be a patron saint of “desperate situations. ”" "Askha runakunan mañakunku Mariaman angelkunaman, santopaq qhawarisqanku runakunaman ima; hukninkaqmi Antonio de Padua, payqa necesitasqankuta qoq patronninkus; hukninkaqtaqmi Judas Tadeo, nisqankuman hinaqa sinchi ñak’ariypi tarikuqkunaq patronninsi."
"Many worshippers pray to such “saints ” and to angels in the hope that these entities will intercede for them before God." "Chay santokunapi creeqkunaqa ninkun Diosman asuykunankupaq paykuna yanapasqanta."
"True worshippers should pray to “our Father in the heavens. ”" "Cristianokunaqa hanaq pachapi Taytanchismanmi mañakunanchis."

"HELP FOR THE FAMILY | MARRIAGE" "FAMILIAKUNAPAQ YANAPAYKUNA | CASARASQAKUNAPAQ"
"You cannot forget the bad things your spouse has said or done; the harsh words and thoughtless acts are indelibly etched in your memory." "Manapaschá qonqayta atinkichu rimaspapas ruwaspapas qosayki sonqoykita k’irisqanta."
"As a result, the affection you once had has been replaced by resentment." "* Sientesqa kaspaykipaschá manaña ñawpaqpi hinañachu munakapunki."
"You have no choice, it seems, but to endure a loveless marriage." "Ninkipaschá: “Hina mana munasqachá kawsanay kanqa riki ”, nispa."
"You resent your spouse for that too." "Chaypaschá astawanraq sientesqa kashanki."
"Be assured that things can improve. First, though, consider a few facts about resentment." "Chaykunaqa allichakunmanmi, ichaqa yachanaykin sientepakuy imarayku mana allinniykipaq kasqanta."
"Holding on to resentment creates a burden that keeps your marriage from moving forward" "Sientepakuyqa huk ancla hinan hark’an casarasqakuna allin kawsanankuta"
"Resentment can destroy a marriage. Why?" "Sientepakuyqa casarasqa kawsaytan urmachin."
"Because it undermines the very qualities upon which a marriage should be built, including love, trust, and loyalty." "Munanakuypas confianakuypas kaqtinqa allintan casarasqakunaqa kawsanku, sientepakuymi ichaqa chaykunata chinkachin."
"In a sense, then, resentment is not the result of a marital problem; it is a marital problem." "Chayqa huk onqoy hinañan manan onqoypa qallariyninchu."
"For good reason, the Bible says: “Put away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness. ” ​ — Ephesians 4: 31." "Chaymi Bibliaqa niwanchis phiñapakuyta chinkachinapaq."
"If you harbor resentment, you are hurting yourself." "Sientepakuqmi k’irikun."
"Harboring resentment is like slapping yourself and then expecting the other person to feel the pain." "Sientepakuyqa kanman hukta nanachinaykipaqpas qan kikiykita maqakuwaq hinan."
"“The family member who is the focus of your resentment may be feeling just fine, enjoying life, and perhaps not at all troubled by any of this, ” writes Mark Sichel in his book Healing From Family Rifts. The bottom line?" "Mark Sichel runan “Familiapi k’irinakuykunapaq hampi ” nisqa libro qelqasqanpi nirqan:“ Sientechiq runaqa manapaschá reparanchu sientechisqanta, chaymi thak kashanman; sientekuq runan ichaqa sientekusqanwan astawan k’irisqa tarikun ”, nispa."
"“Resentment hurts you far more than the person you resent, ” Sichel says." "Sientepakuyqa kanman hukta nanachinaykipaqpas qan kikiykita maqakuwaq hinan"
"Resentment is a choice. Some people might doubt that." "Mana sientepakuq kaytaqa atiwaqmi."
"They would say, ‘ My spouse made me resentful. ’" "Wakinqa ninkun “manan atiymanchu ” nispa."
"The problem is, such thinking puts the emphasis on something that cannot be controlled ​ — the actions of another person." "Huk esposaqa ninmanpaschá: “Qosaymi sientechiwan, chhaynaqa imaynapitaq mana sientekuymanchu ”, nispa."
"The Bible offers an alternative." "Chhaynata piensayqa hukpa ruwasqantapas controlayta munanman hinan kanman."
"It says: “Let each one examine his own actions. ”" "Biblian kayta ruwananchispaq niwanchis: “Sapanka pay kikinpa kawsasqanta allinta qhawakuchun ”, nispa."
"We cannot control what someone else says or does, but we can control how we react to it. Resentment is not the only option." "Manan atisunmanchu hukkuna munasqanchisman hina ruwanankutaqa, ichaqa sapankan decidiyta atisunman imaynatachus kutichinanchista, manataqmi sientepakuywanchu kutichinanchis."
"Take responsibility for your resentment." "Kallpachakuy ama sientepakuq kanaykipaq."
"Granted, it is easy to blame your spouse. But remember, resentment is a choice. So is forgiveness." "Sientekusqaykimanta qosaykiman tumpayqa facilmi kanman, ichaqa qosaykita pampachaymi aswan allinqa."
"You can choose to follow the Bible’s admonition: “Do not let the sun set while you are still angry. ”" "Bibliaq kay nisqanta ruway: “Ama p’unchay ch’isiyaqqa phiñasqa kaychischu ”."
"A spirit of forgiveness gives you an opportunity to approach your marriage problems with a better mind - set. ​ — Bible principle: Colossians 3: 13." "Casarasqa kawsayniykichispi problemakunata allichanaykipaqqa pampachaqmi kanayki (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Colosenses 3: 13)."
"Examine yourself honestly." "Imayna kasqaykita qhawarikuy."
"The Bible acknowledges that some people are “prone to anger ” and“ disposed to rage. ”" "Wakinqa ratollan phiñakuywan atipachikunku (Proverbios 29: 22)."
"Does that describe you?" "¿Chhaynachu yaqapas kanki?"
"Ask yourself: ‘ Am I inclined toward bitterness?" "Tapukuy: “¿Sientepakuqchu kani?"
"How easily am I offended?" "¿Usqhaylla phiñakuqchu kani?"
"Do I tend to make issues over minor matters? ’" "¿Imatapas yapaykuspachu rimani? ”, nispa."
"The Bible says that “the one who keeps harping on a matter separates close friends. ” That can happen in a marriage as well." "Biblian willan sapa kutilla pantasqankuta niyqa amigokunata t’aqanachisqanta (Proverbios 17: 9; Eclesiastés 7: 9)."
"So if you have a tendency toward resentment, ask yourself, ‘ Could I be more patient with my spouse? ’ ​ — Bible principle: 1 Peter 4: 8." "Casarasqa kawsaypiqa kanmi chayqa, sichus reparakunki sientepakuq kasqaykita chayqa pacienciayoq kay qosaykipaq (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: 1 Pedro 4: 8)."
"Decide what is truly important." "Tapukuy “¿kayri discutinapaq hinachu? ”"
"The Bible says that there is “a time to be silent and a time to speak. ”" "nispa. Biblian nin: “Kanmi upallakuna tiempo, rimana tiempopas ”, nispa (Eclesiastés 3: 7)."
"Not every offense needs to be discussed; sometimes you can simply “have your say in your heart, upon your bed, and keep silent. ”" "Ima ruwasqanmantapas otaq rimasqanmantapas sapa kutilla “chaypas kaypas phiñachiwanmi ” nispa niyqa manan allinchu."
"When you do need to discuss a grievance, wait until your irritation has passed." "Mayninpiqa ‘ puñunapi kashaspaña ch’inlla sonqonchista t’aqwikuymi ’ aswan allin (Salmo 4: 4)."
"“When I feel hurt, ” says a wife named Beatriz,“ I try to calm down first." "Beatriz sutiyoq warmin nin: “Sonqoyta k’iriwaqtinkuqa suyaniraqmi phiñakuyniy pasananta."
"Sometimes I later realize that the wrong was not that serious anyway, and then I’m more inclined to speak respectfully. ” ​ — Bible principle: Proverbs 19: 11." "Mayninpiqa reparanin mana sientekunapaq hinachu kasqanta, chaymi sumaqllata rimaspa allichani ”, nispa (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Proverbios 19: 11)."
"Understand the meaning of “forgive. ”" "Allinta yuyaymanay imachus pampachay kasqanpi."
"In the Bible, the word “forgive ” is sometimes translated from an original - language word that suggests the idea of letting go of something." "Bibliapiqa rikhurinmi pampachay simi, chayqa griego simipiqa “hinallata pasachiy ” ninantan nin."
"Therefore, to forgive does not require that you minimize the offense or act as if it never occurred; it could mean that you simply let it go, realizing that resentment can do more damage to your health and your marriage than the offense itself." "Pampachayqa manan ruwasqanta manapas ruwanmanchu hinata qhawariychu; aswanpas ruwasqanta hinallata pasachiymi, chaytaqa ruwan saludninpaqpas casarasqa kawsayninpaqpas sientepakuyqa mana allin kasqanta reparaspan."
"“Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely. ” ​ — Colossians 3: 13." "Kaypi yuyaychayqa qosakunapaqwanmi. “Qankunapura paciencianakuychis, [...] pampachaykunakuychis ”"
"“Love covers a multitude of sins. ” ​ — 1 Peter 4: 8." "“Munakuyqa askha huchakunatan pampachan ”"
"“The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger, and it is beauty on his part to overlook an offense. ” ​ — Proverbs 19: 11." "“Runaq allin yuyayniyoq - kayninqa phiñakuytan hark’an, k’amiqninta hinallata qhawaqqa hatunchasqan kanqa ” (Proverbios 19: 11)"
"For the next week, notice three positive traits in your spouse." "Qatiqnin qanchis p’unchaykunapi reparay qosayki kinsa kaqkunapi allin runa kasqanta."
"Write them down at the end of the week, and tell your spouse why you appreciate those traits." "Chayta qelqaspa willay imarayku chaykunata allinpaq qhawarisqaykita."
"Focusing on the positive will help you to fight off resentment." "Chayta ruwaspaqa manan usqhayllachu sientepakunki."

"At the very least, you can learn from the experience and resolve to do better next time. False success is different." "Fracasashasqankuta mana reparakuqkunan ichaqa mana allinta ruwashaspapas allinta ruwashanankupaq qhawarikunku."
"Under its influence you can think you are winning when in fact you are losing." "Qhepaman reparakuspaqa yaqapaschá manaña allichayta atinkumanñachu."
"By the time you see the need to change, it may be too late. Consider an example." "Jesusmi nirqan: “Huk runachus kay pachantinpi lliw kaqkunata paylla hap’ikapunman kawsaynintataq chinkachikapunman chayqa, ¿ima allintaq paypaq kanqa? ”, nispa."

"“Thinking only in terms of the next major promotion, making more money or acquiring more stuff, fails to feed the soul, ” writes career counselor Tom Denham."

"“Simply measuring success in monetary terms is shallow and will leave you empty in the long - term. ”" "Chhaynata kawsaqkunaqa qhepamanmi reparakunku manapas imatapas tarinkumanchu hinata ”, nispa."

"Clearly, many people can distinguish between false success and true success ​ — at least when they are asked." "Wakinqa reparanchismi imatachus ruwananchis mana fracasanapaq chayta."
"It is more challenging, however, to make decisions that reflect the proper view of success." "Ichaqa manapaschá reparasunmanchu decidinanchis ratopiqa."

"“Sometimes girls ask me for my phone number and offer to ‘ hook up ’ with me. I refuse and walk away." "16 watayoq Carlos * nin: “Mayninpin compañeraykuna telefonoypa numeronta mañawaspa niwanku: ‘ ¿Paseaq risunmanchu, imallatapas ruwasunmanpaschá? ’, nispa."
"But in the back of my mind, there’s a lingering thought, ‘ What if I had given her my number? ’" "Ñoqaqa ‘ manan ’ nispallapunin kutichini."
"Honestly, some of those girls are very attractive." "Chay qhepamanmi ichaqa piensani: ‘ Qollayman numeroyta karqan ’, nispa."

"After all, temptation can take many forms." "Cuerpoypin ichaqa wak kamachikuq kasqanta reparakuni, chayqa huchan."
"The apostle Paul was not young when he wrote: “I really delight in the law of God..., but I see in my body another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law. ”" "Chay huchaqa munayniypa contranmi hatarin, hinaspan cuerpoypi kaq kamachikuqman hap’iykachiwan ”, nispa."
"Despite the pressure, Paul resisted the urge to give in ​ — and so can you!" "Pabloqa manan pisiparqanchu, qanpas manan pisipanaykichu. Ama atipachikuychu cuerpoykiq munapayasqanwan."
"Really, why be a slave to your desires?" "Kanqapunin tentacionkunaqa."
"Learning to resist temptation while you are young will set you free from much anxiety now and will also prove to be a vital skill that you will need in adulthood." "Waynallaraq kashaspa atipanki chayqa, kunanpas kurak kaspapas manan problemakunapichu tarikunki."
"The media fuels temptation." "Televisionpas hukkunapas manan yanapasunkichu."
"The Bible speaks of “youthful desires, ” which are strong enough as it is." "“Wayna - kaypa waqllisqa munapayayninkunamanta ” ayqeyqa sasan."
"But movies, TV, music, and books marketed to young people often intensify those desires by conveying the impression that surrendering to temptation is acceptable." "Peliculakunapas, televisionpas, takikunapas, wayna - sipaskunapaq librokunapas chay munapayaykunamanta ayqeytan aswan sasamanraq tukuchin."
"For example, if two characters in a movie are ‘ in love, ’ it is all but certain that they will have sex with each other at some point in the story." "Runakunatan creechin “tentacionman urmayqa manan huchachu ” nispa."
"However, the Bible says that real men and women have the power to “keep abstaining from fleshly desires. ”" "Munanakuymanta peliculapi actuaqkunaqa warmi - qhari puñuymanmi chayanku."
"That means you can choose to resist temptation." "Ichaqa kawsayqa manan peliculakuna hinachu, ñoqanchisqa atisunmi mana allinkunamanta ayqeyta, chaytan Biblia nin."
"But how? Know your weaknesses." "Imakunapi pisipasqaykita reqsikuy."

"Do you?" "¿Pay hinachu kanki?"
"Find supportive friends." "Yanapaqniyki amigokunata maskhay."

"Avoid circumstances that will make temptation harder to resist." "Tentacionman apaq ruwaykunamanta karunchakuy."
"For example: Do not allow yourself to be alone with a member of the opposite sex." "Ama sapallayki qhepakuychu huk qhariwan otaq huk warmiwan."
"Avoid using the Internet at a time or a place that might make it tempting for you to view pornography." "Ama huñukuychu mana allin ruwaykunata allinpas kanman hinata ruwaq runakunawan."

"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"Millions of sincere people venerate images as part of their worship." "Millonninpi runakunan imagenkunata yupaychanku."
"But is the practice endorsed in the Bible?" "¿“Allinmi ” ninchu chayta Biblia?"
"Does it please God?" "¿Allinpaqchu Dios qhawarin chayta?"
"“You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth." "“Aman ima idolotapas, ima rikch’aytapas ruwakunkichu, hanaq pachapi kaqman rikch’akuqtapas, kay pachapi kaqman rikch’akuqtapas [...]."

"The veneration of images is consistently condemned in the Hebrew Scriptures, commonly known as the Old Testament" "Católico religionmanta huk qelqan nin: “Judiokunaqa askha imagenkunatan utilizaqku Diosta yupaychanankupaq ”, nispa."
"According to the New Catholic Encyclopedia, the Jews had an abundance of images associated with their worship “and these representations were honored, reverenced, and venerated. ”" "Nillantaqmi: “Chay imagenkunatan paykunaqa yupaychaqku hatunchaqku ”, nispa."

"Católico religionmanta qelqaqa chaytapaschá nin, ichaqa hunt’aq sonqowan Diosta serviq judiokunaqa manan chay templopi figurakunataqa yupaychaqkuchu."

"That was some 200 years after Jesus died. Therefore, what the New Catholic Encyclopedia calls “early Christian worship ” is not the earliest Christian worship ​ — that which was practiced by first - century disciples and described in the Christian Greek Scriptures, commonly known as the New Testament." "Chay imagenkuna tarisqankuqa reparachinmi 200 watakunapaqqa pantasqa religionpi hina imagenkunata yupaychasqankuta, chhaynapi askha runakuna haykunankupaq."

"Veneration of images is a religious practice that has no support in the Bible." "Bibliaqa manan ninchu idolokunata yupaychanapaqqa."
"For that reason, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not venerate images, nor do they have religious images in their homes or in their places of worship" "Chayraykun Jehová Diospa testigonkunaqa mana yupaychankuchu, nitaqmi wasinkupipas huñunakunanku wasipipas churankuchu"

"The New Catholic Encyclopedia defines veneration as “a religious act, an act of worship. ”" "“Señor Diosniykitan yupaychanki, pay sapallantataqmi servinkipas ”."
"In this context, images include pictures, icons, statues, symbols, and anything else that is venerated." "Kay qelqapiqa yupaychanapaq dibujokunata, estatuakunata otaq huk simbolokunatawanmi nikushan imagenkuna nispa."

"Consider what occurs when a horse gallops." "Patasninkuna imayna ruwasqa kasqanraykun."
"Elastic muscle - tendon units absorb energy when the leg steps onto the ground, and much like a spring, they return it, propelling the horse forward." "Caballoq patasninpiqa kanmi aychapas hank’ukunapas, chaykunan huk resorte hina pampaman chayaqtin kutichimun."
"Furthermore, at a gallop the horse’s legs vibrate at high frequencies that could injure its tendons." "Sichus mana aycha kanmanchu chayqa hank’unkunachá patasninkuna pampaman chayaqtin k’irikunman."
"However, the muscles in the legs act as dampers." "Ichaqa huk amortiguador hinan aycha yanapan mana k’irikunanpaq."

"The fact that your child has lied does not mean that he is on a fast track to moral corruption." "Wawayki llullakuqtinqa manan ninaykichu “kay wawayqa suwachu kanqapas ” nispaqa."
"Remember, the Bible says: “Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child. ”" "Bibliaq nisqan hina, yaqapaschá wawaykiq sonqonpiqa saphichasqa kashan ‘ loqhe - kay ’ otaq mana yuyayniyoq - kay (Proverbios 22: 15)."
"Some children manifest such foolishness by lying, perhaps thinking that it is an easy way to avoid punishment." "Wakin wawakunaqa mana castigasqa kanankupaqmi llullakunku, chhaynapin rikuchinku mana yuyayniyoq kasqankuta."
"How you respond, then, is important." "Chayraykun yanapanaykipaqqa allinta reparanayki."
"Try to discern why your child is lying." "Reparay imarayku wawayki llullakusqanta."
"Does he fear punishment? Does he not want to disappoint you?" "Yaqapaschá llullakun castigasqa kayta manchakuspa otaq mana phiñakunaykita munaspa."
"If your child spins stories to impress his friends, is it because he is not old enough to understand the difference between reality and fantasy?" "Sichus allinpi qhepananrayku cuentokunata paqarichispa amigonkunaman willan chayqa, yaqapaschá mana reparanraqchu cheqaq kaqta llullakuymanta."
"If you know why your child is lying, you will be better able to correct him. ​ — Bible principle: 1 Corinthians 13: 11." "Sichus imarayku llullakusqanta reparanki chayqa atinkin yanapayta (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: 1 Corintios 13: 11)."
"At times, use statements instead of questions." "Ruwasqanta yachashaspaykiñaqa ama tapuychu."
"In the scenario described at the outset, the mother, who already knew the facts, sternly asked her son: “Did you break that vase? ”" "Qallariypi rimasqanchis mamaqa yacharqanñan wawanpa ruwasqanta, chaywanpas tapurqanmi: “¿qanchu maceterota p’akirurqanki? ”, nispa."
"The child lied, perhaps fearing Mom’s wrath." "Wawanqa maman mana phiñakunanraykun “manan ” nispa kutichirqan."
"But instead of asking an accusatory question, suppose that the mother had simply stated: “Oh, no, you broke the vase! ”" "Ichaqa sichus maman sut’ita ninman karqan “¡ay, maceterota p’akirqosqanki! ”, nispa chayqa, wawanqa manapaschá llullakunmanchu karqan."
"By using a statement rather than a question, she does not tempt the child to lie ​ — and she helps him build a pattern of honesty. ​ — Bible principle: Colossians 3: 9." "Chhaynatan wawakunataqa yachachina sut’illanta willakunankupaq (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Colosenses 3: 9). Sut’illanta willakuqtinqa “kusa waway ” nispa niy."

"Make clear to your child that lying destroys trust and that it can take a long time to rebuild trust once it is broken." "Sut’inta niy: “Llullakuqtiykiqa manañan qanpi confiasaqchu, hukmanta qanpi confianaypaqqa sasan kanqa ”, nispa."

"Set the example." "Sut’illanta rimaychis."
"Obviously, you cannot expect your child to be truthful if he hears you say such things as “Tell him I’m not home ” when you do not want to speak to someone on the phone or“ I’m staying home sick today ” when you really just want to relax. ​ — Bible principle: James 3: 17." "Sichus wawaykita yachachiwaq: “Manan kaypichu niy ”, nispa; otaq uyarisunkiman:“ Mana llank’aq risqaymanta tapuwaqtinqa ‘ onqosqan karqani ’ nispa nisaq ”, nispa nisqaykita chayqa, ima uyaykiwanmi wawaykita niwaq “manan llullakunaykichu ” nispa (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Santiago 3: 17)."

"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"“Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit. ” ​ — 2 Corinthians 7: 1." "“Tukuy qhelli kaqmanta ch’uyanchakusun aycha cuerponchispipas espiritunchispipas ” (2 Corintios 7: 1)"
"Our Creator loves us and wants us to enjoy good health and long, productive lives." "Diosqa munakuwanchismi, chayraykun mana munanchu onqonanchista, aswanpas munanmi unay kawsananchista."
"“May your heart observe my commandments, ” God says,“ because they will add many days and years of life and peace to you. ”" "Niwanchismi: “Kamachikuyniykunata sonqoykipi waqaychay, chaymi unayta kawsanki, anchatapunin t’ikarinki ”, nispa (Proverbios 3: 1, 2)."
"God’s love for humans was reflected in his commandments to Israel, which included specific directions on hygiene and sanitation." "Diosqa Israel llaqtamanmi kamachikuykunata qorqan cuerponkupi limpio kanankupaq, chhaynatan rikuchiwanchis munakuwasqanchista (Deuteronomio 23: 12 - 14)."
"When the Israelites adhered to those reasonable standards, they enjoyed improved health and protection against diseases that plagued other nations, such as Egypt, that did not have such an advanced law code. ​ — Deuteronomy 7: 12, 15." "Chay kamachikuykunaqa manan sasa hunt’aychu karqan, kasukuspaqa manan huk nacionkunapi hinachu onqoqku. Egipto nacionpiqa manan karqanchu cuerponkupi limpio kanankupaq kamachikuykuna (Deuteronomio 7: 12, 15)."
"Likewise today, people who “cleanse [themselves] of every defilement of flesh, ” which includes such defiling habits as smoking, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse, reduce their risk of illness ​ — physical and mental — ​ as well as premature death." "Kay tiempopiqa imaymana viciokunan aycha cuerponchista qhellichanman, wakinkunan kaykuna: tabacota q’awchiy, tragota ukyay, drogakuy, hukkunapas. Chaykunamanta karunchakuqkunaqa manan chay viciokunaq paqarichisqan onqoykunawan onqonkuchu, aswan unaytataqmi kawsankupas."
"And because we do not usually live in isolation, our adherence to God’s standards of cleanness also shows our consideration for others. ​ — Mark 12: 30, 31." "Chaymantapas cuerponchispi limpio kaspaqa rikuchinchismi runamasinchiskuna munakusqanchista."
"“Deaden... your body members... as respects sexual immorality, uncleanness, uncontrolled sexual passion, hurtful desire, and greediness, which is idolatry." "“Kay pachapi lliw millay ruwaykunamanta t’aqakuychis, ama qhelli huchapi puriychischu [...], ama cuerpoykichispa munasqanta ruwaychischu, ama mana allinta yuyaykuychischu, ama munapayaychischu [...]."

"As stated earlier, the Bible exhorts us to “cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit. ”" "Bibliaqa niwallanchistaqmi “espiritunchispipas ” limpio kanapaq."
"In the time of Jesus Christ, many people, including the Jewish religious leaders, went to great lengths to be physically clean but disregarded moral and spiritual standards." "Jesuspa tiemponpiqa askha judiokunan hinallataq religionpi umallikunapas nishuta llakikuqku cuerponkupi limpio kanallankumanta, ichaqa kawsayninkupipas Dios yupaychayninkupipas manan limpiochu kasharqanku."
"Putting matters in the right perspective, Jesus said: “Nothing from outside that enters into a man can defile him, since it enters... into his stomach, and it passes out into the sewer. ” He then added:“ That which comes out of a man is what defiles him. For from inside, out of the heart of men, come injurious reasonings, sexual immorality, thefts, murders, acts of adultery, greed, acts of wickedness, deceit, brazen conduct, an envious eye,... and unreasonableness." "Chayta huchachananpaqmi Jesusqa nirqan runataqa mana mikhusqanchu qhellichasqanta aswanpas sonqomanta lloqsimuq qhellichasqanta, “runakunaq sonqonmantaqa lloqsimun: mana allin yuyaykuna, wasanchaykuna, qhelli huchapi puriykuna, runa wañuchiykuna, suwakuykuna, munapakuykuna, millay kaykuna, q’otuykuna, mana p’enqarikuykuna, lerq’opayaykuna [...], mana yuyayniyoq kaykunapiwan ”."
"All these wicked things... defile a man. ” ​ — Mark 7: 18 - 23." "Tukuy chay mana allinkunan sonqomanta lloqsimun, chaytaq runata qhellichan."
"According to Jesus, people who take an extreme view of bodily hygiene while at the same time disregarding God’s moral and spiritual standards are like cups that are clean outside but filthy inside. ​ — Matthew 23: 25, 26." "Jesuspa nisqanman hinaqa, sichus nishuta llakikunku cuerpollankupi limpio kanankupaq, Diospa kamachikuyninkunatataq mana kasukunkuchu chayqa, hawallanpi limpio vaso hinan kanku, ukhuntaq ichaqa qhellillaña."
"“This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome. ” ​ — 1 John 5: 3." "“Diosta munakuspanchisqa kamachikusqankunatan kasukunchis, kamachikuyninkunaqa manataqmi sinchi sasachu ” (1 Juan 5: 3)"
"At Micah 6: 8, we read: “What is Jehovah requiring of you?" "Miqueas 6: 8 texto nin: “¿Imatataq Señor Diosqa ruwanaykita munan?"
"Only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty, and to walk in modesty with your God! ”" "Chanin kaqllatapuni ruwanaykitan, khuyapayakuqllapuni kanaykitan, Diosniykiq ñawpaqenpi huch’uyyaykukuspa kawsanaykitan ”, nispa."
"Is that not a most reasonable request?" "Chay niwasqanchistaqa hunt’ayta atisunmanmi, ¿riki?"
"Moreover, our Creator wants us to obey him out of love." "Diosqa munakusqanchisrayku servinanchistan munan."
"When we do, we experience great joy." "Chhaynata servispaqa kusisqan kasunchis (Salmo 40: 8)."
"And when we err, we can take comfort in God’s mercy." "Pantasunmanña chaypas confiananchismi khuyapayawananchispi."
"“As a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those who fear him." "Biblian nin: “Imaynan taytaqa wawankunata khuyayta munakun, ahinatan Señor Diosqa manchakuqninkunata khuyayta munakun ”, nispa."
"For he well knows how we are formed, remembering that we are dust, ” or subject to frailties and imperfection. ​ — Psalm 103: 13, 14." "“Payqa reqsiwanchismi imayna kasqanchista, yuyarikuwanchismi ñut’u hallp’a kasqanchista ” otaq pantaq kasqanchista, chayraykun khuyapayawanchis (Salmo 103: 13, 14)."
"In summary, God’s standards of physical, moral, and spiritual cleanness reflect his goodness and love for us." "Diosqa munakuwasqanchistan rikuchiwanchis cuerponchispi limpio kanapaq, kawsayninchispipas Dios serviyninchispipas ch’uya kanapaq kamachikuykunata qowasqanchispi."
"Our willing adherence to those standards shows our wisdom and our love for him." "Kasukusqanchiswanmi rikuchisun imaynata munakusqanchista."
"ON THE east bank of the Motoyasu River in Hiroshima City, Japan, stands a building that has remained partly in ruins since 1945." "HIROSHIMA (Japón) llaqtapin Motoyasu mayu patapi tarikun bombaq mana thunisqan wasi, chay wasiqa 1945 watamantapachan imayna qhepasqan hinalla kashan."
"Why has it not been rebuilt for nearly 70 years?" "Yachasun imarayku chhaynalla kashasqanmanta."
"Completed in 1915, the original three - story brick - and - mortar structure served as an exhibition hall to promote industry." "Chay kinsa pisoyoq wasiqa cementomantawan ladrillomantawan ruwasqan, 1915 watapin wasichayta tukurqanku; chaypin organizaqku fabricakuna astawan yapakunanpaq."
"But that changed on August 6, 1945, at 8: 15 a.m." "Ichaqa 6 agosto 1945 watamantapachan chayqa cambiapurqan, 8: 15 horas tutamantanta."
"At that moment, the first atomic bomb ever used in warfare detonated about 1,800 feet (550 m) above the city and almost directly above the exhibition hall." "Ñawpaq kaq bomba atomican airepi t’oqyarqan chay wasiq qayllallanpi, 550 metro altopi hina."
"Everyone inside died instantly. The core structure of the building, however, remained standing." "Chay wasipi kaqkunaqa kikin raton wañupurqanku, chay wasin ichaqa kaqlla sayarqan."
"Preserved unchanged, it is “a stark and powerful symbol of the most destructive force ever created by humankind, ” says a UNESCO * article." "Runaqa mana khuyapayakuq kasqantan rikuchirqan “sinchi atiyniyoq ruwasqanku armawan ” tukuyta thunispa, chayta yuyarinankupaqmi chay wasiqa mana allichasqachu karqan, chaytan nin UNESCO * nisqamanta huk qelqa."

"Sadly, though, such poignant memorials have not stopped war, which is often caused by greed, nationalism, and racial, religious, and tribal hatred." "Runaq mana khuyapayakusqanta yuyarinapaqqa imaymana monumentokunan kan, chaywanpas guerrakunaqa kashallanmi runakuna imaymanata munapayaq kasqankurayku, huk nacionniyoq huk religionniyoq kasqankumanta cheqninakusqankurayku ima."
"So, will warfare always be with us?" "Chhaynaqa, ¿kallanqapunichu guerrakuna?"
"The Bible answers no!" "Manan, guerrakunaqa chinkapunqan."
"“[God] is bringing an end to wars throughout the earth, ” says Psalm 46: 9." "Salmo 46: 9 textopin Biblia nin: “[Diosmi] teqsimuyuntinpi awqa - tinkuykunata qolluchin, wach’ina p’eqtakunatapas lanzakunatapas p’akirqarin, carretakunatapas ruphaykachin ”, nispa."

"At the same time, God will replace human rulership with his own world government ​ — God’s Kingdom in the hands of Jesus Christ, who is designated “King of kings. ” ​ — Revelation 11: 15; 19: 16." "Chaymantapas Diosqa gobiernokunaq rantinpin huk gobiernota churanqa, chaypin kamachinqa “Reykunaq Reynin ” Jesucristo.

"One in four people will be affected by mental disorder at some point in their lives." "Tawa runamantan huk runa kawsayninpi ima ratopipas umanmanta mana allinchu kanqa."

"Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are among the most severe and disabling disorders...." "Askhaña umankumanta mana allinchu kanku chaypas paykunapaqqa pisin yanapaykuna ” (Organización Mundial de la Salud [OMS])."
"Although huge numbers of people are affected, mental disorders remain hidden, neglected and discriminated against. ” ​ — World Health Organization (WHO)." "OMS nisqanman hinaqa, umankumanta mana allin kaqkunaqa askhas mana yanapayta maskhankuchu p’enqasqa pisichasqa sientekusqankurayku."
"According to WHO, many people with mental illness refrain from seeking treatment because of the stigma associated with it." "Umankumanta mana allin kaqkunapaq kanña tratamiento chaypas, askhan mana hampichisqa kanku."
"Although most mental disorders are treatable, in the United States approximately 60 percent of adults and almost 50 percent of youths aged 8 to 15 with a mental disorder did not receive treatment in the past year, reports the National Alliance on Mental Illness." "Qayna watan Estados Unidospi 100 runakunamanta 60 mana hampichisqachu karqanku, 8 watamanta 15 watayoqkama kaqkunataqmi 100 wawakunamanta 50 (chayta willan Alianza Nacional de Enfermedades Mentales nisqa)."

"Mental - health disorders are not the result of personal weakness or a character flaw" "Manan nisunmanchu “caracterninpi chhayna kasqanraykuchá umanmanta mana allinchu kashan ” nispaqa"
"The severity of symptoms can vary in length and intensity, depending on the individual and the particular ailment and circumstances." "Umankumanta mana allin kaqkunaqa sapankan hukniray kanku, ima onqoywan kasqankuman hina, imaynapi tarikusqankuman hina."
"It can affect people of any gender, age, culture, race, religion, or educational and income level. Mental - health disorders are not the result of personal weakness or a character flaw." "Chayqa pitapas hap’inmanmi qhariña, warmiña, qolqeyoqña, mana qolqeyoqña, ima religionniyoqña kanman chaypas."
"Through appropriate medical care, individuals can be treated and can live a productive and fulfilling life." "Manataqmi nisunmanchu “caracterninpi chhayna kasqanraykuchá umanmantaqa mana allinchu ” nispaqa."
"Mental - health professionals can treat many mental - health disorders successfully." "Allin tratamientowan hampichikuspaqa allintan kawsankuman."
"The first crucial step, then, is to obtain a thorough assessment from a competent health professional who is experienced in treating mental conditions." "Umankumanta mana allin kaqkunaqa rinankun chay onqoymanta yachaq doctorman, chhaynapi imachus ruwanankuta allinta yachanankupaq."
"Sufferers, however, can benefit from such experience only when they accept suitable treatment." "Umankumanta mana allin kaqkunaqa doctorpa nisqanman hinan ruwananku."
"This may require overcoming any reluctance to talk to others about a mental illness." "Yaqapaschá p’enqakuyninkutapas atipasparaq rimananku kanqa."
"Treatment may include talking to trained mental - health professionals who can help them understand their illness, resolve practical problems, and reinforce the need not to give up the treatment." "Doctorwan parlayqa yanapanqan onqoyninkumanta allinta entiendenankupaq, kawsayninkupi problemankuta allichayta atinankupaq, tratamientota mana saqenankupaqpas."
"At such consultations, a family member or friend can play a vital role by providing reassurance and support." "Chaykunaman familiankuwan otaq amigonkuwan riyqa allintan yanapanqa."
"Many people have learned to deal with mental disorders after acquiring a better understanding of their condition and following the treatment prescribed by mental - health professionals." "Askha runakunan onqoyninkuman costumbrakapurqanku onqoyninkumanta yachasqanku qhepaman tratamientota chaskisqanku qhepaman ima."
"“Before my wife was diagnosed, ” says Mark, quoted earlier,“ we had little understanding of mental illness." "Mark nin: “Ñawpaqpiqa manan imatapas yacharqaykuchu umankuwan mana allin kaqkunamanta."
"But we’ve learned to take life one step at a time and adapt to our situation." "Qhepamanmi ichaqa costumbrakapurqayku chay onqoyman, yacharqaykutaqmi ima ruwayta."
"Over time, we have benefited from the support of reliable professionals as well as family and friends. ”" "Doctorpas familiaykupas amigoykupas allintan yanapawarqanku ”, nispa."

"“But even though my illness places limitations on both of us, I have learned that seemingly impossible hurdles can be overcome." "Chay onqoywan kaqkunaqa wakin ruwaykunatan sasapaq qhawariyku, chaywanpas atirqanin chaykuna atipayta."
"So I cope with my mental illness by working together with my treatment team, nurturing relationships with others, and taking one moment at a time. ”" "Ñoqaqa kasukurqanin doctorpa niwasqanta, manan hukkunamanta karunchakurqanichu, pacienciakurqanitaqmi; chaykunan yanapawarqan ”, nispa."
"The Bible does not indicate that spirituality cures medical problems." "Bibliaqa manan ninchu “allin iñiyqa onqoykunapaq hampin ” nispaqa."
"Still, many families around the world have derived much comfort and strength from what the Bible teaches." "Ichaqa Biblian askha familiakunata yanaparqan sonqochasqa kallpachasqa kanankupaq."
"For instance, the Bible assures us that our loving Creator is keenly interested in consoling those who are “brokenhearted ” and“ crushed in spirit. ” ​ — Psalm 34: 18."

"“Learning to control your temper is part of leaving childhood and becoming an adult." "“Wiñasqanchisman hinan controlakuytaqa yachanchis."

"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"Some people feel that God causes human suffering or that, at the very least, he is indifferent to it." "Wakin runakunaqa ninkun “Diosmi sufrichiwanchis ” nispa, otaq ninku“ manan paymanqa imapas qokunchu sufrisqanchisqa ” nispa."
"But is that what the Bible teaches?" "Ichaqa, ¿chaytachu Biblia nin?"
"You might be surprised at the answer." Yachasun.
"“For a certainty, God does not act wickedly. ” ​ — Job 34: 12." "“¡Diosqa manan hayk’aqpas mana allintaqa ruwanmanchu! ”"
"Some say that everything that happens is God’s will." "(Job 34: 10)"
"Thus, they believe that God causes us to suffer." "Wakin runakunan ninku: “Hasta ichhupiwanpas Diospa munayninpin aytikun ”, nispa."
"When natural disasters strike, for instance, they think that these events are God’s way of punishing those who have sinned." "Chayraykun ima desgraciapas kaqtinqa ninku: “Diospa castigonmi chayqa ”, nispa."
"The Bible clearly teaches that God does not cause us to suffer." "Diosqa manan pitapas sufrichinchu."
"For example, the Bible says that when we go through trials, it would be a mistake to say: “I am being tried by God. ” Why?" "Sichus huk runa ninman “Diosmi wateqashawan otaq pruebashawan ” nispa chayqa pantashanmi."
"Because “with evil things God cannot be tried, nor does he himself try anyone. ”" "Diosqa manan pitapas mana allinwanqa pruebaman churanchu."
"In other words, God never causes the trials we face or the suffering that follows. To do so would be wicked, but “God does not act wickedly. ” ​ — Job 34: 12." "Problemakunaqa anchatan sufrichiwanchis, sichus chaykunata Dios churawasunman chayqa mana allinta ruwaq Dioschá kanman, ichaqa Biblian nin: “¡Diosqa manan hayk’aqpas mana allintaqa ruwanmanchu! ”, nispa (Job 34: 10)."
"If God does not cause us to suffer, then who or what does?" "¿Manataq Dioschu sufrichiwanchis chayqa, pitaq sufrichiwanchisri?"
"Sadly, humans are often victimized by other imperfect humans." "Mayninpiqa runamasinchispa huchanpin sufrinchis (Eclesiastés 8: 9)."
"Additionally, we may face calamities because of “unexpected events ” ​ — that is, because of simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time." "Chaymantapas mayninpiqa qonqaymi ima desgraciapas otaq ima accidentepas pasawasunman (Eclesiastés 9: 11)."
"The Bible teaches that ultimately “the ruler of this world, ” Satan the Devil, is responsible for human suffering, for“ the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one. ”" "Ichaqa astawanqa ‘ kay pachapi kamachikuqmi ’ sufrichiwanchis, chay kamachikuqqa Saqra Satanasmi, Biblian willan ‘ lliw kay pacha saqraq munaychakusqan kashasqanta ’."
"It is Satan ​ — not God — ​ who causes people to suffer." "Chhaynaqa Saqra Satanasmi sufrichiwanchis manan Dioschu."
"“During all their distress it was distressing to him. ” ​ — Isaiah 63: 9." "“Pipas qankunata tupaykuqqa ñawi ruruytan tupaykun ” (Zacarías 2: 8)"
"Some think that God is indifferent to our trials." "Wakin runakunaqa ninkun: “Diosqa manan imatapas sientenchu sufrisqanchista rikuspaqa ”, nispa."
"For example, one writer cites what he calls God’s “apparent lack of mercy or pity in reaction to our suffering. ”" "Huk qelqaq runan nirqan: “Diosqa manapunin khuyapayawanchischu, chayqa sut’i reparaymi ”, nispa."
"This writer argues that if God exists, he must view humans with “pitiless indifference. ”" "Nillarqantaqmi: “Kanña Dios chaypas manachá chhikallantapas sientenchu sufrisqanchista rikuspaqa ”, nispa."
"Far from depicting God as pitiless or indifferent, the Bible teaches that God is deeply moved by our suffering ​ — and that he will soon bring an end to it." "Diosqa anchatan khuyapayawanchis sufrisqanchista rikuspaqa, hinaspapas payqa pisi tiempollamantan problemanchiskunata tukuchinqa."
"Consider three comforting truths found in the Bible." "¿Imaynapin chayta yachanchis? Yachasun."
"God is aware of our suffering." "Diosqa yachanmi sufrisqanchista."
"From the very start of human suffering, not a single teardrop has gone unnoticed by Jehovah, * whose “watchful eyes ” see everything." "Runaqa ñawpa tiempomantapachan waqayllapi kawsan, Jehová Diosqa * reparanmi chaykunataqa."
"For example, when his worshippers in ancient times were being oppressed, God said: “I have certainly seen the affliction of my people. ”" "Diosqa rikumushanmi imaynapi tarikusqanchista (Salmo 11: 4; 56: 8)."
"But was he only vaguely aware of their pain?" "Yachanapaq, serviqninkunata sufrichishaqtinkun nirqan: “Allintan rikuni llaqtaypa [...] muchushasqanta ”, nispa."
"No, for he added: “I well know the pains they suffer. ”" "Ichaqa manan rikullarqanchu, nillarqantaqmi: “Yachanitaqmi ñak’arishasqankutapas ”, nispa (Éxodo 3: 7)."
"Many people have found comfort in that truth alone ​ — the thought that God is aware of everything we suffer, even the trials that others may not be aware of or fully understand. ​ — Psalm 31: 7; Proverbs 14: 10." "Manaña hukkuna yachankuchu nanayninchismanta chaypas Diosqa allintan yachan, payqa allintan entiendewanchis; chayta yachaspan askha runakuna thak sientekunku (Salmo 31: 7; Proverbios 14: 10)."
"God feels for us when we suffer." "Diosqa khuyapayawanchismi sufriqtinchis."
"For example, God was sincerely troubled when his ancient worshippers faced trials." "Ichaqa Diosqa manan qhawayllachu qhawamun, payqa sientenmi nanayninchismanta."
"“During all their distress it was distressing to him, ” says the Bible." "Biblian nin: “Pipas qankunata tupaykuqqa ñawi ruruytan tupaykun ”, nispa (Zacarías 2: 8)."
"Although God is vastly superior to humans, he feels empathy for those who suffer ​ — as if their pain were in his heart!" "Jehová Diosqa kamaqninchismi payqa hatunchanapaqmi, chaywanpas sufriqtinchisqa paypas sufrishanman hinan sientekun, sonqonraqmi nanan."
"Indeed, “Jehovah is very compassionate and merciful. ”" "Chhaynataqa sientekun ‘ ancha khuyapayakuq llakipayakuq ’ kasqanraykun."
"Additionally, Jehovah helps us to bear our suffering. ​ — Philippians 4: 12, 13." "Hinaspapas yanapawanchismi llakikuyninchispi."
"God will end all human suffering." "Diosqa chinkachinqan sufrimientota."
"According to the Bible, God will bring an end to the suffering of every human on the planet." "Diosqa gobiernonwanmi kay pachapi problemakunata allichanqa."
"By means of his heavenly Kingdom, Jehovah will drastically change the human condition ​ — for the better." "Wiñaypaqmi runakunaq sufrisqanta chinkachipunqa."
"Regarding that time, the Bible promises that God “will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away. ”" "Prometewallanchistaqmi kaytapas: “Diosmi paykunaq ñawinkumanta tukuy weqeta pichanqa, manan wañuypas kanqañachu, manallataqmi llakikuypas, waqaypas, nanaypas kanqañachu, ñawpaqkaqkunaqa manaña kapusqanrayku ”, nispa."
"What about those who have already died?" "¿Iman kanqa wañupuqkunamanta?"
"God will bring them back to life here on earth so that they too can enjoy life free from suffering." "Diosmi kawsarichimpunqa kay pachapi thak kaypi kawsanankupaq."
"Will anyone be plagued by painful memories of past suffering?" "¿Pillapas sufrinqachu kay kawsayta yuyarispa? Manan."
"No, for Jehovah promises: “The former things will not be called to mind, nor will they come up into the heart. ” ​ — Isaiah 65: 17." "Jehová Diosmi prometewanchis: “Ñawpaq sucedesqankunaqa qonqasqan kapunqa, manañan yuyarisqapasñachu kanqa ”, nispa (Isaías 65: 17)."

"‘ For the first time in my life, I found happiness. ’" "“Manan hayk’aqpas chhayna kusisqaqa sientekurqanichu ”"
"HILTON loved boxing." "HILTON waynaqa boxeadormi karqan."
"At the age of seven, he was getting into fights ​ — both in and out of the ring!" "Payqa 7 watanmantapachan maqanakuyta yacharqan."
"When in high school, he would roam about with friends, looking for someone to beat up." "Wayna kaspaqa amigonkunawan kuskan puriq hukkunata maqaspa."
"“I stole, gambled, watched pornography, harassed women, and swore at my parents, ” he says." "Ninmi: “Ñoqaqa suwan karqani, apostaqmi kani, pornografiatan qhawaq kani, warmikunatan molestaq kani, tayta - mamaytapas manan respetaqchu kani."
"“My behavior was such that my parents considered me beyond reform." "Chaymi niwaqku ‘ manan hayk’aqpas cambiawaqchu ’ nispa."
"After I finished high school, I left home. ”" "Manaraq 20 watayoq kashaspaymi wasiymanta ripurqani ”, nispa."
"When Hilton returned 12 years later, his parents could hardly believe this was their son! He was calm, controlled, and respectful." "Qhepamanmi Hiltonqa respetoyoq llamp’u sonqo runaman tukupurqan, chaymi 12 wata qhepaman wasinman kutipuqtin tayta - mamanqa mana creeytapas atirqanchu."
"What led to this astonishing transformation? While he was away, he began to reflect seriously on where his life was headed." "Hiltonqa wasinmanta ripusqan qhepamansi allinta piensaykusqa vidanmanta, Bibliatas leeyta qallarisqa."
"He also examined the Bible to see if it could help him change his ways." "Ninmi: “Bibliapi yachasqayman hinan kawsayta qallarirqani."
"“I applied what I read in the Bible, ” said Hilton,“ which meant getting rid of my old personality and obeying the command at Ephesians 6: 2, 3 to honor my parents." "Caracterniypin cambiarqani, Efesios 6: 2, 3 textopin yacharqani tayta - mamay respetayta."
"For the first time in my life, I found genuine happiness, and I brought joy to my father and mother, not more heartache! ”" "Manan hayk’aqpas chhayna kusisqaqa sientekurqanichu, tayta - mamaypas anchatan kusikurqanku chhayna kapusqaymanta ”, nispa."
"Hilton’s story underscores both the relevance and the transforming power of Bible values." "Hiltonpa kawsayninmantan kaykunata yachanchis: Bibliaqa serviwanchismi kay tiempopipas, atiyniyoqmi runaq kawsayninta cambiananpaqpas."
"Let us consider some of those values ​ — namely, honesty, self - control, fidelity, and love — ​ and how they can greatly enrich lives." "Bibliapin yachanchis honrado kayta, cuerponchis dominayta, munakuq kayta, casarasqakunatapas yanapanmi pantay ñanman ama urmanankupaq, chaykunamantan yachasun qatiqninpi."
"Some say that the Bible is out - of - date, like a manual for an obsolete computer." "Wakinqa ninkun: “Manan Bibliaqa valenñachu kay tiempopaqqa, cosaskuna hinan huk tiempollapaq karqan ”, nispa."
"But that comparison is both superficial and deceptive." "Ichaqa manan chhaynachu."
"Computers change and thus manuals become outdated." "Cosaskunaqa arí cheqaqtan huk tiempollapaq, ichaqa runaq sentimientonqa manan cambianchu."
"Basic human nature does not change. For example, people today respond to love and hate, fidelity and infidelity, kindness and cruelty in much the same way as our ancestors did." "Pipas munakuwaqtinchisqa ñoqanchispas ñawpaq tiempopi runakuna hinan sientekunchis; kaqllataqmi suceden sichus pipas khuyapayawasunman otaq cheqnikuwasunman chaypas."

"WHILE being rich may have certain advantages, wealth is a mixed blessing, especially in our perilous times." "QHAPAQKUNAQA qolqenkuwanmi kusisqa kawsanku, ichaqa qolqeyoq kasqankuraykun peligrokunapi tarikullankutaq."
"In some lands, the wealthy, including tourists who look affluent, have become targets of thieves and kidnappers seeking a ransom." "Wakin nacionkunapiqa suwakunaqa suwanku qhapaqkunata, qhapaqpaq qhawarikuq runakunata iman."
"Concerning one developing country, a news report stated: “Violent robberies, fraud and kidnappings pit the haves against the have - nots." "Pobre llaqtakunamanta willaq qelqan nirqan: “Qhapaqkunawan pobrekunawanqa suwanakuspa secuestranakuspa estafanakuspa iman kawsanku."
"Restaurants post armed guards; the homes of the wealthy have walls with razor - wire, floodlights, cameras and security guards. ”" "Restaurantekunatapas armasqa runakunan cuidan; qhapaqkunapas wasinkupin churachinku camarakunata, kuchukuq alambrekunata ima ”, nispa."
"A similar situation exists in many other lands." "Askha nacionkunapin chayqa rikukun."
"Yet, “the poor, ” the Bible says,“ are not even threatened. ”" "Pobrekunatan ichaqa “mana pipas manchapachinchu ”."
"How can you benefit from that gem of wisdom?" "¿Imaynatan yanapasunkiman chayta Bibliaq nisqan?"
"If you live in an area known for crime and violence or if you have to travel to such a place, do not attract attention to yourself by appearing to be affluent." "Yaqapaschá tiyasqayki otaq llank’asqayki ladopi sinchi suwakuna kan, chhayna kaqtinqa ama qhapaqpas kawaq hinaqa puriychu."
"Think carefully about what you wear and carry in public, especially if your possessions would be noticed." "Suwakunaqa qhawankun imayna p’achawan churakusqaykita; cosasniykikunatapas ama alabakusparaqqa apaychu."
"“The shrewd one sees the danger, ” says Proverbs 22: 3,“ but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences. ”" "Allin yuyayniyoqqa ima peligrotapas reparaspaqa karunchakunmi, “pisi yuyayniyoqkunan ichaqa pasallanku hinaspan k’irisqa rikukapunku ”, chaytan Biblia nin (Proverbios 22: 3)."
"The wisdom recorded in the Bible reflects our Creator’s care for us. He wants us to be safe." "Diosqa manan munanchu khuyay llakisqa purinanchista, chayraykun payqa Bibliapi qelqachirqan chhayna yachachikuykunata."
"Such “wisdom is a protection, ” says Ecclesiastes 7: 12, for it“ preserves the life of its owner. ”" "Bibliaq nisqan hina yachayniyoq kayqa runatan allinta kawsachin (Eclesiastés 7: 12). Arí, Bibliapi yachachikuykunaqa cuidawanchismi."
"INTERVIEW | ANTONIO DELLA GATTA" "TAPUSUN | ANTONIO DELLA GATTA"
"AFTER studying in Rome for nine years, Antonio Della Gatta was ordained as a priest in 1969." "ROMAPI 9 wata estudiasqan qhepamanmi Antonioqa 1969 watapi nombrasqa karqan sacerdote kananpaq."
"Later, he served as the rector, or head, of a seminary near Naples, Italy." "Qhepamanqa sacerdotekunaq escuelanmantan encargakurqan Nápoles (Italia) llaqtapi."
"While there, after much study and meditation, he concluded that the Catholic religion is not based on the Bible." "Yachasqankunapi allinta piensaspan nirqan: “Católico religionqa manan Bibliaq nisqanman hinachu yachachin ”, nispa."
"He spoke with Awake!" ¡Rikch’ariy!
"about his spiritual journey." "revistata qelqaqkunan paywan rimarqanku."
"Please tell us about your childhood." "Willawayku erqellaraq kasqaykimanta."
"I was born in Italy in 1943." "Italia nacionpin nacerqani 1943 watapi."
"I grew up with my brothers and sisters in a small village where my father was a farmer and a carpenter." "Huk huch’uy llaqtapin hermanoykunawan wiñarqani."
"Our parents raised us to be good Catholics." "Taytayqa carpinteron karqan chakrapi iman llank’arqan."
"Why did you want to become a priest?" "Tayta - mamayqa católico religionmanmi apawarqanku."
"As a boy, I loved listening to the priests in church." "¿Imaraykun sacerdote kapurqanki?"
"I was enchanted by their voices, as well as the impressive rituals." "Huch’uyniymantapachan gustawaq misaman rispa sacerdoteq rimasqanta uyariy."
"So my heart was set on becoming a priest." "Imaymana costumbrekunata ruwasqanmi admirachiwaq, chaymi ñoqapas sacerdote kayta munarqani."
"When I was 13 years of age, my mother took me to a boarding school that prepared boys for future, more - advanced studies for the priesthood." "Mamaymi apawarqan sacerdote kanapaq escuelaman 13 wataypi kashallaqtiyraq, astawan chaypi preparasqa kanaypaq."
"Did your training involve Bible study?" "¿Estudiarqankichu Bibliata sacerdotepaq preparakushaspa?"
"Not really." "Pisillatan estudiaq kani."
"When I was 15, one of my teachers gave me a copy of the Gospels ​ — the historical accounts of Jesus ’ life and ministry — ​ and I read the book several times." "Huk profesorniymi qowarqan Jesusmanta willaq librokunata 15 wataypi kashaqtiy, chaykunatan sapa kuti leeq kani."
"When I was 18, I went to Rome to study in the pontifical universities, which are directly under the pope’s authority." "Chaymantataq 18 wataypi kashaspan Roma universidadman rirqani sacerdote kanaypaq, chaypiqa papan autoridad."
"I studied Latin, Greek, history, philosophy, psychology, and theology." "Chaypin yacharqani latín, griego, historia, filosofía, psicología, teologiata ima."
"Although we recited verses from the Bible and heard Bible readings in Sunday sermons, we did not actually study the Bible." "Sapa domingonmi misapi recitaq kayku Bibliaq versiculonkunata ichaqa manan estudiarqaykuchu."
"You became a rector. Did that involve teaching?" "Seminariomanta encargado kashaqtiyki, ¿dictarqankichu cursokunata?"
"My work was mainly administrative." "Decretos del Concilio Vaticano II nisqa cursollatan dictarqani."
"But I did teach classes on the decrees of the Second Vatican Council." "Astawanqa oficinapin llank’arqani."
"Why did you start doubting the church? Three things troubled me." "¿Imaraykun iskayarqanki religionniykimanta?"
"The church was involved in politics. Misconduct among the clergy and parishioners was tolerated. And certain Catholic teachings did not seem right." "Kaykuna raykun: Politicapin chaqrukunku, sacerdotekunaq chayman riqkunaq millaykuna ruwasqankutapas hinallatan qhawanku, yachachisqankupas manan Bibliaq nisqanwan tupanchu."
"How, for example, could a God of love punish people forever after death?" "¿Imaynapin munakuq Dios runakunata castiganman infiernopi?"
"Also, does God really want us to repeat prayers hundreds of times with a rosary?" "¿Diosninchis munanmanchu rosariota hap’ispa kaq resayllata pachak kutikunataraq payman resananchista?"

"What did you do?" "¿Ima ruwanaykipaqmi decidikurqanki?"
"With tears streaming from my eyes, I prayed for guidance." "Waqasparaqmi Diosmanta mañakurqani yanapawananpaq; Biblia de Jerusalén nisqa Bibliatan rantikurqani italiano simipi, chaytataq leeyta qallarirqani."
"I also purchased a copy of the Catholic Jerusalem Bible, which had recently been published in Italian, and began reading it." "Huk domingo tutamantantan misa ruwasqay pasayta chayamurqanku iskay Jehová Diospa testigonkuna."
"Then, one Sunday morning as I was hanging up my robes after Mass, two men came to the seminary." "Paykunawanmi rimarqani iskay hora masta Bibliamanta ¿ima ninmi Biblia cheqaq religionmanta?"
"They introduced themselves to me as Jehovah’s Witnesses." "nisqa temamantapas."
"What was your impression of the visitors?" "¿Imatan rikurqanki Testigokunapi?"
"I admired their conviction and the ease with which they referred to passages in a Catholic edition of the Bible." "Paykunaqa católica Bibliapipas facil - llatan textokunata tarirqanku leepuwanankupaq, chaymi admirachiwarqan."
"Later, another Witness, named Mario, began visiting me. He was patient and faithful ​ — every Saturday morning, rain or shine, he rang the seminary doorbell at nine o’clock." "Chay qhepamanmi visitamuwarqan Mario sutiyoq Testigo, payqa sapa sábado 9 horas tutamantantan hamuq, paraqña chikchikña chaypas seminario punkupin kasharqan."
"What did the other priests think of those visits?" "¿Imaniqkun huk sacerdotekuna chaymanta?"
"I invited them to join in our discussions, but none took Bible study seriously." "Invitarqanin paykunatapas ichaqa manan mayqenninkupas munarqankuchu."
"I, however, enjoyed it." "Ñoqamanmi ichaqa nishutapuni gustawarqan Bibliata estudiay."
"I was learning wonderful things, such as why God tolerates evil and suffering ​ — something that had long puzzled me." "Ñawpaqpiqa manan entienderqanichu imarayku Dios hinallata qhawan millay kawsayta sufriytapas chayta, kunanmi ichaqa yachani."
"Did your superiors try to dissuade you from studying the Bible?" "¿Mayqen sacerdotepas nirqasunkichu Bibliata ama estudianaykipaq?"
"In 1975, I visited Rome several times to explain my views." "1975 watapin Roma llaqtata askha kutita rirqani yachasqaymanta huk sacerdotekunawan rimamunaypaq."
"My superiors tried to change my thinking, but none used the Bible." "Paykunan ichaqa niwarqanku: “Pantashankin ”, nispa."
"Finally, on January 9, 1976, I wrote to Rome stating that I no longer considered myself a Catholic." "Chaymi 9 enero killapi 1976 watapi huk cartata apachirqani Roma llaqtaman, chay religionta renunciapunaypaq."
"Two days later, I left the seminary and took a train to attend my first meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses, which turned out to be an assembly involving several congregations." "Iskay p’unchaymantan ripurqani, hinaspa rirqani Jehová Diospa testigonkunaq huñunakuyninman."
"Everything was so different from what I was accustomed to!" "Chay kutiqa asamblean kasqa, askha iñiq t’aqakunataq huñunakusqaku."
"Each Witness had a Bible and followed along with the speakers as they discussed various topics." "Sapankan Bibliayoqkama karqanku textokunata maskhanankupaq, ¡chayqa admirakunapaqmi karqan!"
"What did your family think about all of this?" "¿Familiaykiri ima nirqantaq?"
"Most of them bitterly opposed me." "Familiaykunaqa phiñakurqankun."
"I found out, however, that one of my brothers was studying with the Witnesses in Lombardy, a region in northern Italy." "Ichaqa huknin hermanoymi Bibliata estudiashasqa Jehová Diospa testigonkunawan Lombardía llaqtapi Italia nacionpa wichay ladonpi."
"I went to see him, and the Witnesses there helped me to find work and a place to live." "Visitaqmi rirqani, chaypin Testigokuna yanapawarqanku trabajota conseguinaypaq wasitapas tiyanaypaq."
"Later that year, I was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses." "Chay watapin bautizakapurqani. Kunanqa allintan Diosta reqsini"
"At last, I feel truly close to God" "¿Arrepientekunkichu ruwasqaykimanta?"
"Do you have any regrets?" "¿Imamantataq arrepientekuymanri?"
"Not at all!" "Kunanqa allintan Diosta reqsini, Bibliapi paymanta yachaspan astawan payta reqsini."
"At last, I feel truly close to God, because what I know about him is based on the Bible, not philosophy or church tradition." "Manan católico religionpa nisqanman hinachu."
"And I can teach others with conviction and sincerity." "Kunanmi ichaqa cheqaqta yachasqaymanta tukuy sonqoywan runakunaman willani."

"Talking about death will not cause your child to have morbid thoughts." "Sichus wawayki wañuymanta tapusunki chayqa yachachiy mayqen familiaykichispas wañupuqtin imata ruwananpaq."
"Rather, it will help him alleviate fears." "Ama niychu “rimaqtiyqa mancharukunqapaschá ” nispaqa, aswanpas willaqtiykiqa manañan manchakunqañachu."
"However, you may need to correct some misunderstandings." "Ichaqa wañuymanta willaspaqa wakin mana allin piensasqankutan aclaranayki kanqa."
"For example, some experts say that many children under the age of six do not view death as final." "Wawakunamanta yachaqkunan ninkun: “Manaraq 6 watayoq wawakunaqa huk ratollapaqmi wañuyta qhawarinku."
"In their games, a child will be “dead ” one moment and“ alive ” the next." "Chaymi wañuchinakuspa pukllaspaqa huk ratolla wañurunku ”, nispa."
"When they get a little older, however, children begin to grasp the seriousness of death ​ — a fact that may cause them to have questions, concerns, or even fears, especially if a loved one has died." "Ichaqa wiñasqankuman hinan aswan allinta entiendenku wañuymanta; chaymi tapukunku, llakikunku, manchakunku ima; chayraykun rimanayki paykunawan."
"Therefore, it is vital that you discuss the subject. Mental - health expert Marion Haza points out: “A child will develop anxieties related to death if he feels that he is not allowed to talk about this subject at home. ”" "Marion Haza doctoran, nin: “Sichus huk wasipi mana rimanapaq hinata wañuymanta rimayta qhawarinkuman chayqa, wawakunaqa sinchi manchakuytan qallarinkuman ”, nispa."
"You need not worry excessively about what to say." "“Imatataq nisaqri ” ninkipaschá."
"According to one study, children just want to “hear the truth expressed in kind words. ”" "Yachaqkunaq nisqanman hinaqa wawakunaqa “wañuymanta cheqaqta willanankutas munanku ”."
"Be assured that a child will usually not ask a question unless he is ready to hear the answer." "Wañuymanta tapukuspankuqa rikuchishankun yachanankupaq preparasqaña kasqankuta."
"Take advantage of opportunities to talk about death." "Rimana kaqtinqa rimay wañuymanta."
"If your child sees a dead bird on the side of the road or if a beloved pet dies, use simple questions to encourage him to talk." "Ima animaltapas wañusqata rikuspan wawaykita tapuwaq: “¿Ñak’arishankumanchu mayllapipas?"
"For example, you could ask: “Does a dead animal suffer?" "¿Chirichikushanmanchu, yarqachikushanmanchu?"
"Is it cold or hungry? How do you know that an animal or a person is dead? ” ​ — Bible principle: Ecclesiastes 3: 1, 7." "¿Imaynapin yachanchis animalpas runapas wañusqaña kasqankuta? ”, nispa (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Eclesiastés 3: 1, 7)."
"Do not hide the truth." "Cheqaqllata willay."
"When an acquaintance or a relative has died, avoid using confusing euphemisms such as “He has gone away. ”" "Mayqen familiaykipas wañupuqtinqa ama niychu “ripunmi ” nispa."
"Instead, use simple and direct words. For example, you might say: “When Grandma died, her body stopped working." "Chhaynata niqtiykiqa wawaykiqa ninmanmi “chhaynaqa kutimpullanqachá ” nispa."
"We can’t talk to her, but we will never forget her. ” ​ — Bible principle: Ephesians 4: 25." "Aswanpas niwaqmi: “Abuelaykiqa wañupunmi, manañan imatapas ruwayta atinmanñachu, manañan paywanqa rimaytapas atisunmanñachu, chaywanpas manan qonqasunchu ”, nispa (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Efesios 4: 25)."
"Since a young child might think that death is contagious, assure him that he is safe" "Yaqapaschá wawayki piensanman wañuyqa contagiakuq kasqanta."
"Reassure your child." "Ichaqa entiendenanmi mana chhaynachu kasqanta."
"He might think that his actions or thoughts caused someone’s death." "Entiendechiy mana paychu huchayoq kasqanta."
"Instead of just saying that he is not responsible for what happened, you could ask, “What makes you think that it is your fault? ”" "Yaqapaschá wawaykiqa piensan “huchaypin wañupun ” nispa, chayraykutaq llakikushanman. Chaymi tapuwaq:“ ¿Imaraykun chhaynata piensanki? ”, nispa."
"Listen carefully, without belittling his feelings." "Allinta uyariy rimasqanta, entiendeytaq imayna sientekusqanta."
"Also, since a young child might think that death is contagious, assure him that he is safe." "Chaymantapas yaqapaschá wawayki piensanman wañuyqa contagiakuq kasqanta."
"Draw out your child. Talk freely about loved ones who have died, including relatives whom your child has never met." "Ichaqa entiendenanmi mana chhaynachu kasqanta, chhaynapi mana manchakunanpaq. Kallpachay rimananpaq."
"You might evoke fond memories of an aunt, an uncle, or a grandparent and relate amusing anecdotes." "Wawaykiq mana reqsisqan familaykiña otaq amigoykiña wañuqtinpas rimallay paykunamanta."
"When you openly discuss such people, you help your child understand that he need not avoid talking or thinking about them." "Willawaqmi tion, tian, otaq abuelan imayna runa kasqanmanta, asikunapaq hina ruwasqankumantapas."
"At the same time, do not force your child to talk." "Chhaynapin reparanqaku wañuqkunamanta rimayqa normal kasqanta."
"You can always broach the subject later, when you feel the time is right. ​ — Bible principle: Proverbs 20: 5." "Mana rimayta munaqtinqa ama nishuta rimapayaychu, yaqapaschá huk p’unchayña rimapayawaq (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Proverbios 20: 5)."
"Chapters 34 and 35 of the book Learn From the Great Teacher can help your children learn what the Bible teaches about death.

"If a loved one has died, you can help your child overcome inordinate fears about death by making sure he understands the following:" "Mayqen familiaykipas wañupuqtinqa wawaykiqa wañuytapaschá sinchita manchakunman. Chaypi yanapanaykipaq kaykunata entiendechiy:"
"He is not going to die." "Manan paypas wañullanqataqchu."

"You might say, “You cannot see Grandma anymore, but you can keep memories of her in your heart. ”" "Kaytan niwaq: “Abuelaykita manaña rikupusunñachu chaypas, yuyashallasunmi ”, nispa."
"Remember, saying nothing to your child will not reduce his anxiety. On the contrary, it may only serve to give his imagination free rein." "Wawaykita wañuymanta mana imatapas niyqa manapunin yanapanqachu, aswanpas ima munasqantan wañuymanta piensanqa."

"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"Some people view gambling as an innocent diversion, while others see it as a dangerous vice." "Wakin runakunan ninku: “Qolqepaq pukllayqa allinmi ”, nispa."
"Many people view gambling as harmless fun, as long as it is practiced legally." "Wakintaq ninku: “Viciomanmi apawasunman ”, nispa."
"Some forms of legalized gambling, such as government - sponsored lotteries, generate revenue for programs that benefit the public." "Askha runakunan ninku: “Qolqepaq pukllayqa manan huchachu sichus mana leypa contranpichu kashan chayqa."
"The Bible makes no significant mention of gambling." "Bibliaqa manan rimanchu qolqepaq pukllaymanta."
"Yet, it does offer a number of guiding principles that reveal how God feels about gambling." "Ichaqa yanapawanchismi imaynatan Dios qhawarin qolqepaq pukllayta chayta entiendenanchispaq."
"The basic nature of gambling ​ — winning money at the expense of others — ​ is at odds with the Bible’s warning to “guard against every sort of greed. ”" "Chay pukllaypiqa huk pukllaqkunaq qolqentan ganayta munanku, chay ruwayqa Jesuspa nisqan contrapin kashan, paymi nirqan: “Tukuy imaymana munapayaymanta cuidakuychis ”, nispa."
"Gambling is, in fact, fueled by greed." "Runaqa pukllan qolqeta munapayasqanraykun."
"Gaming institutions advertise big jackpots, while downplaying the poor odds of winning, because they know that dreams of wealth prompt players to wager large amounts at the casinos." "Yachankuña mayninpi mana gananankuta chaypas qhapaq kayta munaspan runakunaqa chay pukllaykunapi askha qolqeta apostanku."
"Rather than helping a person guard against greed, gambling promotes the desire for easy money." "Pukllana wasikunataq millonninpi premiokunata munachinku."
"Gambling is based on an inherently selfish goal: winning money that other players have lost." "Chaymi runakunata astawan tanqan pukllaspa facil - llata qolqe ganayta munanankupaq."
"However, the Bible encourages a person to “keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person. ”" "Qolqepaq pukllaqkunaqa paykunallapaq kananta munaspan hukkunaq qolqe pierdesqankuta apakunku."
"And one of the Ten Commandments states: “You must not desire... anything that belongs to your fellow man. ”" "Moisesman Diospa qosqan kamachikuypipas kaytan nishan: ‘ Aman munapayankichu [...] runamasiykiq imantapas ’, nispa (Éxodo 20: 17)."
"When a gambler sets his heart on winning, he is, in essence, hoping that others will lose their money in order for him to profit." "Qolqepaq pukllaqqa hukkunaq pierdenantan munan, hinaspa llapa qolqeta apakapunanpaq."
"The Bible also cautions against viewing luck as a mystic force that might bestow blessings." "Bibliaq nisqan hina manan suertepichu confiananchis qolqeyoq kanapaqqa."
"In ancient Israel, there were some who lacked faith in God and began “setting a table for the god of Good Luck. ”" "Ñawpa tiempopin wakin israelitakuna manaña Jehová Diospiñachu confiapurqanku aswanpas “allin suertepaq ” dioskunatan adorayta qallarirqanku."
"Was such devotion to “the god of Good Luck ” acceptable to God?" "¿Imaynatan Jehová Dios chayta qhawarirqan?"
"No, he said to them: “You kept doing what was bad in my eyes, and you chose what displeased me. ” ​ — Isaiah 65: 11, 12." "Kaytan nirqan: “Aswanpas mana allinkaqtan ñawpaqeypi ruwarqankichis, millakusqaytan akllakurqankichispas ”, nispa (Isaías 65: 11, 12)."
"True, in some parts of the world, funds from legalized gambling are used to pay for education, economic development, and other public programs." "Wakin nacionkunapiqa chay pukllaykunapi qolqe ganasqankutan escuelakunata ruwanapaq, pobrekunata yanapanapaq ima qonku."
"But the use of those funds does not change how they were obtained ​ — through activities that openly encourage greed and selfishness and that promote the idea of getting something for nothing." "Imapiña chay qolqekunata utilizanku chaypas, qolqepaq pukllayqa runakunatan tanqan munapayayman, paykunallapaq kananta munayman, facil - llata qolqe ganayman ima."
"“You must not desire... anything that belongs to your fellow man. ” ​ — Exodus 20: 17." "‘ Aman munapayankichu [...] runamasiykiq imantapas ’ (Éxodo 20: 17)"
"The Bible warns that “those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and harmful desires that plunge men into destruction and ruin. ”" "Biblian niwanchis: “Qhapaqyayta munaq runakunan ichaqa wateqayta mana atipaspa, toqllaman hina urmaykunku, hinaspan mana valeq waqllichiq munapayaypi rikukuspanku, chaykunawan chinkayman ñak’ariyman urmaykapunku ”, nispa."
"Gambling is rooted in greed, and greed is so corrosive that the Bible lists “greediness ” among several behaviors that should be strongly avoided. ​ — Ephesians 5: 3." "Munapayaymi runakunataqa tanqan qolqepaq pukllayman. Munapayayqa sinchi mana allinmi, chaymi Biblia niwanchis: ‘ Qankuna ukhupiqa ama rimayllapas kachunchu [...] munapayaymantaqa ’, nispa."
"With its focus on easy wealth, gambling nurtures a love of money ​ — something that the Bible identifies as “a root of all sorts of injurious things. ”" "Qolqepaq pukllayqa facil - llata qolqe tariymanmi runakunata tanqan astawanqa qolqe sonqo kayman."
"The desire for money can easily become an overpowering influence in a person’s life, leading to intense anxiety and damaging one’s faith in God." "Biblian nin: “Qolqe sonqo - kaymi tukuy mana allinkunaq saphinqa ”, nispa. Qolqe sonqo runakunaqa chayllapaqñan kawsanku."
"Figuratively speaking, the Bible describes those ensnared by the love of money as having “stabbed themselves all over with many pains. ” ​ — 1 Timothy 6: 10." "Chaymi wakinkunataqa onqochin Diospipas mana iñipunkuñachu. Biblian nin munapayayman urmaqkunaqa ‘ imaymana llakikunapi rikukunankuta ’."
"Greediness breeds discontent, leaving people unsatisfied with their financial status and robbing them of their happiness." "Munapayaq runaqa manan imawanpas contentakunchu, nitaqmi kusisqapaschu kawsan qolqerayku."
"“A lover of silver will never be satisfied with silver, nor a lover of wealth with income. ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 5: 10." "Eclesiastés 5: 10 texto nin: “Qolqeman sonqollikuqqa, astawanpunin munan, imaymanayoq kayta munaqpas, astawanraqmi tariyta munan ”, nispa."
"Millions lured into gambling have found themselves ensnared by a vicious gambling addiction." "Millonninpi runakunan qolqepaq pukllayman urmaykurqanku, kunantaq watasqa hina rikukapunku."
"The problem is widespread, with millions of gambling addicts in the United States alone, according to estimates." "Estados Unidos nacionpin millonninpi kan qolqepaq pukllayman vicioyoq runakuna."
"One proverb states: “An inheritance obtained first by greed will not be a blessing in the end. ”" "Proverbios 20: 21 texton yachachiwanchis munapayaq runakunaqa qhapaqpas kankumansi, ichaqa manan Diospa bendicionninta chaskinqakuchu."
"Problem gambling has plunged addicts into debt or even bankruptcy and has cost many of them jobs, marriages, and friendships." "Chaymantapas qolqepaq pukllaywan vicioyoq runakunaqa manupi iman rikukunku, hinaspapas mana amigoyoq, mana trabajoyoq iman kapunku, familiankupas saqepunmi."
"Applying the Bible’s guiding principles can help a person avoid the negative effects that gambling can have on life and happiness." "Bibliaq nisqanta kasukuyqa pakaykuwanchismi pukllaspa imaymanakunapi tarikunanchismanta."
"“Those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and harmful desires that plunge men into destruction and ruin. ” ​ — 1 Timothy 6: 9." "“Qhapaqyayta munaq runakunan ichaqa wateqayta mana atipaspa, toqllaman hina urmaykunku, hinaspan mana valeq waqllichiq munapayaypi rikukuspanku, chaykunawan chinkayman ñak’ariyman urmaykapunku ”"

"At one time, parents were in charge and children followed their lead." "Ñawpaqpiqa tayta - mamakunan wawankuta kamachiqku wawakunataq kasukuqku."
"For example, consider the following scenarios, all of which are based on typical situations." "Kay tiempopin ichaqa wawakuna kamachikunku tayta - mamakunataq kasukunku."
"While at the store with his mother, a four - year - old boy reaches out for a toy." "Yachanapaq qhawarisun chay problemakunata."
"His mother tries to dissuade him." "Huk tiendapin 4 watayoq wawa pukllanata rikuspa mamitanta rantipunanpaq nin."

"Once again, 12 - year - old James has been accused of shouting at his teacher." "Profesoranmi 12 watanpi kashaq Jaimitota hukmanta atencionta llamasqa malta kutichisqanmanta."

"“I’m going to report her to the school board! ”" "Ejemplolla kaykuna chaypas, kaykunaqa pasanpunin."
"The preceding scenarios are imaginary, but they are hardly far - fetched." "Askha familiakunapin tayta - mamakunaqa wawankuq mana allin comportakusqankuta hinallata qhawanku, mana allinta ruwaqtinkutaq defiendenkuraq."
"They illustrate a real problem that exists in homes where parents tolerate children’s rudeness, cave in to their demands, and “rescue ” them from the consequences of their misconduct." "Familiamanta rimaq libron nin: “Kay tiempopiqa yaqa llapa tayta - mamakunan wawankuq munasqanta ruwanku [...]."
"“It is increasingly common to see parents relinquishing authority to young children, ” says the book The Narcissism Epidemic." "Ñawpaqpiqa sut’itan wawakunaqa yachaqku tayta - mamanku wasipi kamachikuq kasqanta ”, nispa."
"“Not that long ago, kids knew who the boss was ​ — and it wasn’t them. ”" "Wakin tayta - mamakunan ichaqa wawankuta yachachinku allinta kawsanankupaq."
"Of course, many parents do strive to teach their children proper values, not only by setting a good example but also by giving firm but loving correction when needed." "Chaymi paykuna kikinku allinta kawsaspa yachachinku, wanachinata necesitaqtinkutaq munakuywan wanachinku."
"Nevertheless, parents who recognize the value of doing so are, as the book quoted earlier puts it, “swimming against the cultural tide. ”" "Chhaynata wawankuta uywaq tayta - mamakunaqa kallpachakushankun kay tiempopi runakunaq yuyaykusqankuman hina ama ruwanankupaq."
"How did things get to this point?" "¿Imaraykun wawakuna chay hinata comportakushanku?"
"Whatever happened to discipline?" "¿Imaraykun tayta - mamakuna manaña wawankuta wanachinkuñachu?"
"Some say that a weakening of parental authority began in the 1960 ’ s, when so - called experts were urging parents to be more easygoing with their children." "Wakin runakunan ninku 1960 watakunamantapachan pisi - pisimanta manaña tayta - mamakunachu wasinkupi kamachikusqankuta, ¿imarayku?"
"They said: ‘ Be a friend, not an authority figure. ’ ‘ Praise is better than discipline. ’" "“Yachaysapakunan ” tayta - mamakunata animarqanku wawankuta ama nishuta controlanankupaq."
"‘ Rather than correct the bad, catch your children in the act of doing good. ’" "Nirqankutaqmi mana tayta - mamallankuchu kanankupaq aswanpas amigonku kanankupaq ima."
"Instead of striking a balance between commendation and correction, experts seemed to imply that reprimanding children would damage their fragile emotions and cause them to resent their parents later in life." "Chaymantapas nirqankun wawakunata k’aminamantaqa allinmi ruwasqayki nispa niy allin kasqanta."
"Before long, experts were also heralding the virtues of self - esteem." "Tayta - mamakunata allinta aconsejanankumantaqa nirqankun: “Manan wawataqa k’aminachu k’aminki chayqa sonqontan k’irinki hinan wawayki qanpaq sintikapunqa ”, nispa."
"It was as if the secret to good parenting was suddenly discovered, and it was simply this: Make your children feel good about themselves." "Watakunaq pasasqanman hinan yachaysapa runakuna nirqanku: “Wawakunaqa ima ruwasqankuwanpas kusisqan kananku, manan pipas pisichananchu ”, nispa."
"Of course, it is important to instill confidence in children. But the self - esteem movement took things to an extreme." "Arí allinmi chay nisqankuqa, ichaqa paykunan nillarqankutaq wawakunataqa manapunis ninachu “chayqa manan allinchu otaq manan atiwaqchu ” nispaqa."
"Experts told parents: ‘ Avoid using negative words such as no and bad. ’" "Aswanpas wawakunatas ninanchis “ancha valorniyoqmi kanki ima munasqaykitapas ruwawaqmi ” nispa."

"It was as if feeling good was more important than being good. The self - esteem movement has done little more than make children feel entitled" "Wawakunata ima ruwasqankumantapas allillanmi nisun chayqa paykunallapas atiyniyoq kankuman hinatan qhawarichisunman"
"In the end, some say that the self - esteem movement has done little more than make children feel entitled, as if the world owes them."

"One father quoted in that book put it this way: “There is no self - esteem movement in the work world...." "Kay libropi rimasqanchis taytan nin: “Trabajopiqa manan pipas nisunkichu allin runan kanki nispa."
"If you present a bad report at the office, your boss isn’t going to say, ‘ Hey, I like the color paper you chose. ’" "Jefeykiman mana allin ruwasqa imformeta presentaqtiypas manan nisunkichu ‘ munay papelpin ruwamusqanki ’ nispaqa ”, nispa."

"Over the decades, parenting practices have often reflected the ever - shifting opinions of humans." "Tiempoq pasasqanwanmi runakunaq piensasqankuqa cambian, chayman hinataqmi wawakunata imayna educaypas cambiashan."
"“Discipline keeps changing, ” writes educator Ronald G." "Educacionmanta yachaq Ronald Morrish runan nin: “Sapa p’unchaymi wawakunata imaynata wanachiyqa cambiashan, imaynan kay mundopas cambiashallan hinata ”, nispa."

"* It is so easy for parents to be, as the Bible puts it, “tossed about as by waves and carried here and there by every wind of teaching. ” ​ — Ephesians 4: 14." "Wawakuna tukuy imata mañakuqtinkupas tayta - mamakuna “arí ”“ yá ” nillanqaku chayqa manan wawankuq allinninkupaqchu kanqa."
"Clearly, the current wave of relaxed discipline has had negative effects." "Wawankuqa manan atinqakuchu paykunallamanta allinta decidiyta nitaqmi atinqakuchu kawsayninkupi problemakuna atipaytapas."
"It has not only weakened parental authority but also left children without the guidance they need to make good choices and approach life with genuine confidence." "Hinaspapas tayta kasqankutan mana respetachikunqakuchu."
"Is there a better way?" "¿Imaynatan wawakunata aswan allinta educasunman?"
"Italics ours; from the book Secrets of Discipline: 12 Keys for Raising Responsible Children." "Ñoqaykun cursivataqa churayku; “Allin wawakunata uywanapaq yanapaykuna ” (inglés simipi) libro."
"Put yourself in the following situations." "¿Hayk’aqllapas kaykuna pasarqasunkichu?"
"You are a ‘ soccer mom. ’" "Imaymanatan ruwanki wawaykikunarayku."
"After school and on weekends, you ferry your son and daughter from one activity to another: skating lessons, piano lessons, soccer practice ​ — anything to keep them active." "Escuelamanta lloqsimuqtinku, sabadopipas domingopipas wawaykikunata apanki tocayta otaq tusuyta yachanankupaq, chaymantapas apankin pelota hayt’ayta, huk simi rimayta yachanankupaq."

"Isn’t that what it takes to be a good mom? ’" "Piensankitaq “huk allin mamaqa chaytapunin ruwanan ” nispa."
"Consider: What lessons are your children really learning by having a mother who will wear herself out just to keep them involved?" "Kaypi piensay: ¿Imatan wawakuna yachanqaku mamankuta paykunarayku imaymana ruwasqanta rikuspa?"
"In time, might your children come to believe that adults ​ — parents in particular — ​ are here only to serve their children’s needs?" "¿Tayta - mamanku paykunaq kamachin kasqankutachu piensankuman?"

"Because without discipline (1) children continue to be unruly, which exhausts the parents, and (2) parents give inconsistent direction, which confuses the children." "Wawaykikunan mana kasukuspa munasqankuta ruwanqaku qantaq llakisqa sientekunki."

"If so, the Bible has advice that can help you." "Chhayna kaqtinqa Biblian yanapasunki."
"First, though, consider a few things you should know about loneliness." "Ichaqa, ¿imatan yachananchis sapalla sientekuymanta? Chaymanta ñawpaqta yachasun."
"Nearly everyone feels lonely at times." "Yaqa llapa runakunan sapallanku sientekunku."
"That includes people who seem to be popular." "Askha amigokunayoqpas chhaynan sientekunku."
Why? ¿Imanaqtin?
"Because often it is not the quantity of friends but the quality of friendships that determines whether a person feels lonely." "Manan askha amigokunayoq kayllachu allinqa, aswanpas allin amigokunayoq kaymi."
"Someone who seems popular could constantly be surrounded by people but have no real friends and therefore feel lonely." "Sichus mana huk allin amigoyki kanchu chayqa, sapaykin sientekunki askha runakunawanña kashaspapas."
"Loneliness can be hazardous to your health." "Sapallayki sientekuspaqa onqowaqmi."
"Researchers who analyzed the results of 148 studies concluded that low social interaction is a predictor of early death and that as a risk factor, it is “twice as harmful as obesity ” and“ equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. ”" "Investigaq runakunan 148 estudiokunata ruwarqanku, chaypin yacharqanku sapallanku tiyaq runakunaqa pisi tiempollata kawsasqankuta.

"And that can lead to trouble. ”" "Ichaqa chayraykun problemapi tarikuwaq ”, nispa."
"Technology does not always cure loneliness." "Internetpi hukkunawan rimayqa manan yanapasunkichu."
"“I could text or e - mail a hundred people a day and still be incredibly lonely, ” says a young woman named Natalie." "Natalia nin: “Ch’isiyaqpas kallaymanmi mensajekunata apachispa, chaywanpas sapallaymi sientekuni ”, nispa."

"Since you cannot know all the factors involved, why assume the worst?" "Manataq yachankichu imarayku mana invitarasunkikuchu chayqa, manan phiñakunaykichu."
"Instead, direct your energy toward thinking of a better explanation for your being excluded." "Aswanpas kallpachakuy allin kaqta yuyaykunaykipaq."
"Often, it is not the situation but your outlook that brings on feelings of loneliness. ​ — Bible principle: Proverbs 15: 15." "Yaqapaschá qanlla mana allinta yuyaykushanki, hinaspa sapallayki sientekushanki (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Proverbios 15: 15)."
"Avoid sweeping assertions." "Ama mana allinta yuyaykuychu."

"Be willing to befriend those who are older than you." "Ama kurakkunata qonqaychu."
"The Bible tells of the life of David, who was likely a teenager when he met Jonathan ​ — a man 30 years older than he was." "Bibliapin riman Davidmanta, payqa waynallaraq kashaspan Jonatanpa amigon karqan."
"Despite their age difference, David and Jonathan became close friends. You could have the same thing happen in your life." "Jonatanqa 30 wata kurakña Davidmanta karqan chaypas allin amigontinmi karqanku (1 Samuel 18: 1)."

"Appreciate the benefits of solitude." "Ama manchakuychu sapallayki kayta."
"Some people feel lonely as soon as they face a moment of privacy." "Wakinkunaqa manchakunkun sapallanku kayta."
"But simply being alone need not make you feel lonely." "Ichaqa manan sapallayki kashasqaykiraykuchu sapallayki sientekunayki."
"For example, Jesus was sociable, but he also appreciated the value of solitude. You can do the same." "Yachanapaq, señorninchis Jesucristoqa askha runakuna ukhullapin puriq, ichaqa mayninpin sapallan kayta munaq."
"Instead of seeing your being alone as a disadvantage, use quiet time to reflect appreciatively on your blessings." "Sapallayki kasqaykipi piensashanaykimantaqa aswanpas allin cosaskunapi piensay."

"It is reasonable to conclude, then, that God views humans as superior to animals." "Chay textopi nisqan hina, Diosqa runakunatan kamarqan animalkunata kamachinanpaq."
"The Bible says that “God went on to create the man in his image, in God’s image he created him; male and female he created them. ” ​ — Genesis 1: 27." "Génesis 1: 27 texton astawan chayta sut’inchan, ninmi: “Diosqa runata kamarqan, Diosman rikch’akuqtan [...], qharita warmitawanmi kamarqan ”, nispa."
"Because humans were created “in God’s image, ” we are unique in how we display godly qualities, such as wisdom, justice, and love." "Kay textopi nisqan hina, Diosqa kamawarqanchis payman rikch’akuqtan."

"DOMESTIC cats are mostly nocturnal. Whiskers apparently help them to identify nearby objects and catch prey, particularly after dusk." "MICHIKUNAQA tutapin purinku, sunkhantaqmi yanapan cazanankupaq, qayllankupi kaq cosaskunata otaq imatapas reparanankupaq ima."

"As a result, cats can detect nearby objects without seeing them ​ — obviously an advantage in the dark." "Chhaynapitaqmi michikunaqa tutapi reparanku ladonkupi kaq cosaskunata manaña rikunkuchu chaypas."

"Once thought to be limited to developing lands or those battered by war or economic depression, homelessness has “emerged as a major social issue in most developed nations, ” says psychology professor Paul Toro."

"At last, Martín began to receive satisfying answers to his questions." "Chayraqmi yacharqan imapaq kawsasqanta."
"As a result, his depression lifted and he experienced the joy Jesus spoke about when he said: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need. ” ​ — Matthew 5: 3." "“Vecinokunaqa [...] admirasqan qhawawarqanku kawsayniypi cambiasqaymanta ”"
"“People were amazed at the changes I was making ”" "Kawsayninpi cambiasqanqa sut’itan rikukurqan."

"Later, Martín returned to Argentina, where he was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses." "Martinqa Argentina nacionmanmi kutipurqan chaypin Jehová Diospa testigon kapurqan."

"Although spared, Jeremiah lost virtually everything he owned." "Manaña payta aparqankuchu chaypas lliw kaqninkunatan chinkachipurqan."

"For another, he was a student of the Scriptures, which tell of a time when poverty and suffering will cease to exist and will be replaced by true peace and security. ​ — Psalm 37: 10, 11." "Payqa allintan yacharqan Bibliapi Diospa promesankunata, chaymi confiarqan Diosqa sufrimientotapas yarqaytapas tukuchipunanta (Salmo 37: 10, 11)."
"Those conditions will come about, not by human efforts, but by means of a perfect government called God’s Kingdom." "Chay promesaqa manan runakunaq atiyninwanchu hunt’akunqa aswanpas Diospa gobiernonwanmi (Daniel 7: 13, 14)."
"The King of that Kingdom is none other than Jesus Christ, who displayed great compassion for the poor when he was on earth as a man." "Chay gobiernopi kamachikuqqa Jesucriston, payqa kay pachaman hamuspan pobrekunata anchata khuyapayarqan."
"He will rescue the poor who cry for help, also the lowly one and whoever has no helper." "Chay gobierno kamachikuqtinqa ‘ chanin runa t’ikarinqa, thak kawsaypas hunt’aykunqa ’."
"From oppression and from violence he will rescue them. ” ​ — Psalm 72: 7, 12, 14." "Cristoqa ‘ waqyakuqninkunata, wakchakunatan ’, ‘ mana pi yanapayniyoqkunata, muchuqkunata ’ iman ‘ ñak’arichiymanta sarunchaymanta ’ salvanqa (Salmo 72: 7, 12, 14)."

"That sure hope can buoy us up during our trials." "Chay promesakunapi suyakuymi kallpachawasun ima llakikuykunatapas aguantanapaq."
"At the same time, Bible principles can help us to live meaningful and satisfying lives even now, as Joe, Martín, and many others have discovered." "Chay promesakuna hunt’akunankamaqa Bibliapi yachachikuykunan yanapawasun problemanchiskunata allichananchispaq kusisqa kawsananchispaqpas, chay hinatan yanaparqan Joeta Martinta hukkunatapas."
"Indeed, our Creator, Jehovah God, gives us this guarantee: “The one listening to me will dwell in security and be undisturbed by the dread of calamity. ”" "Jehová Dios kikinpunin niwanchis: “Uyariwaqniymi ichaqa mana imanasqalla tiyanqa, mana imatapas manchakuspalla ”, nispa (Proverbios 1: 33)."

"HELP FOR THE FAMILY | PARENTING" "FAMILIAKUNAPAQ YANAPAYKUNA | WAWAKUNATA UYWASPA"
"You and your four - year - old keep getting locked in a battle of wills, and your child always seems to win." "Wakin familiapiqa pichá kamachikuq kakun, taytachus icha wawachus."
"When you tell him to do something he does not want to do, he ignores you. *" "¿Mana ruway munasqanta kamachiqtiykichu wawayki mana kasuyta munasunki?"
"When you tell him not to do something he wants to do, he throws a tantrum." "¿Ima ruway munasqantapas “manan ” niqtiykichu qaparkachayta qallarin?"
"‘ Is this only a phase? ’ you wonder." "¿Wawallaraq kasqanraykuchu chhayna kashanman?"
"‘ Should I just hope that he grows out of it? ’" "¿Wiñaspañachu icha cambianqa?"
"You can teach your child to obey." "Manan wiñanantaraqchu suyanayki."
"But before we discuss how, consider one possible reason for his misbehavior." "Yachachinaykin kasukuytaqa."
"When your child was a newborn, your primary role was that of caregiver." "Ñawpaqtaqa yachanaykin imarayku wawayki mana allin portakusqanta, chaymantañan yachachinayki kasukuq kananpaq."
"You were at your child’s beck and call." "Wawayki naceqtinqa makillan payta cuidarqanki."
"All he had to do was whimper, and you came running, anxious to cater to his every need." "Tukuy tiempon paypa kamachin hina kaq kanki."
"Of course, such a response was proper and necessary." "Waqamuqtinqa usqhayllan phawaq kanki ima munasqanta qonaykipaq."
"A newborn or infant needs a parent’s constant attention." "Wawakunaqa chay hina atiendesqa kayllatan munanku."
"After many months of that treatment, however, it is only natural that a child will act as if he were the master of the house and his parents the servants who are there to do his bidding." "Chay hinata atiendeqtinkun wawakunaqa rey hina sientekunku, tayta - mamankutataq kamachinkuta hina qhawarinku ima munasqankuta mañanankupaq."
"Then, usually by two years of age, the child becomes aware of a harsh reality: His little “autocracy ” has crumbled." "Ichaqa iskay watankupi kashaspankun cuentata qokunku rey hina kasqanku tukukapusqanta, chayta entiendeymi paykunapaqqa sasa."
"His parents no longer follow his orders; they expect him to follow theirs. This is a rude awakening for children!" "Hinaspapas tayta - mamankuqa manañan kasupunkuñachu aswanpas paykunan tayta - mamankuta kasukunanku."
"Some respond by throwing tantrums. Others test their parents ’ authority by refusing to obey." "Chaymi wakin wawakunaqa qaparkachaspa mañosokuyta qallarinku, wakintaq tayta - mamankuta mana kasukuyta munankuchu."
"At that critical time, a parent needs to assume a new role ​ — that of an authority figure who gives clear direction as to what is expected of the child." "Chay edadpi wawanku kashaqtinmi tayta - mamakunaqa wawankuta sut’ita ninanku imachus ruwananta."
"But what if the child ignores or rejects that direction, as depicted in the opening scenario?" "Sichus wawayki mana kasukuyta munanchu chayri, ¿imatan ruwawaq? Chayta kaypi yachasun."
"Take the lead." "Qan kamachikuy."
"Your child will not accept your role as a leader unless he sees you taking the lead." "Wawaykikuna kasunasuykipaqqa qanmi kamachikuq kanayki chaytan reparananku."
"So, in a balanced way, you need to assert your authority." "Ichaqa munakuywan kamachiy respetanasuykikupaq hina."
"In recent decades, some so - called experts have made the word “authority ” sound harsh." "Ñawpaq watakunapin wakin yachaysapakuna nirqanku “kamachikuq ” simiqa mana rimanapaq hina kasqanta."
"One even calls parental authority “unethical ” and“ immoral. ”" "Wakinkunataq ninku kamachispa kasuchikuyqa mana allin kasqanta."
"But the alternative ​ — permissiveness — ​ can leave children feeling confused, indulged, and entitled." "Ichaqa sichus wawaykiman mana sut’itachu kamachinki chayqa manan preparasqachu kanqa qhepaman kawsananpaq."
"It does little to prepare them for responsible adulthood. ​ — Bible principle: Proverbs 29: 15." "Chaymantapas nishu munasqa wawa hinan wiñanqa, tukuy munasqantapas chaskinanpaq derechoyoq kanman hina (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Proverbios 29: 15)."
"Employ discipline." "Wanachiy wawaykita."
"One dictionary defines discipline as “training which produces obedience or self - control, often in the form of rules and punishments if these are broken. ”" "Huk diccionarion wawakuna wanachiymanta nin: “Wanachiyqa kamachikuykunata churaspa castigaspa ima kasukuyta yachachiymi ”, nispa."
"Of course, discipline should never be unreasonable or abusive." "Ichaqa necesitasqankuman hinallan wanachina manataqmi maltratanachu."
"On the other hand, it should not be vague or inconsequential, leaving the child with no incentive to change. ​ — Bible principle: Proverbs 23: 13." "Imachus ruwasqanman hina castigasqa kaqtinkuqa allinninkupaqmi kanqa (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: Proverbios 23: 13)."
"Be clear." "Sut’ita niy ima ruwananta."
"Some parents merely ask for their child’s obedience." "Wakin tayta - mamakunaqa manan sut’itachu wawankuta kamachinku."
"(“I would like you to clean up your room ​ — OK? ”)" "Wawankutan ninku: “Wawachay, ¿cuartoykita ordenawaqchu? ”, nispa."
"Perhaps they feel that this shows good manners." "Sonqonta mana k’irinankupaqpaschá chhaynata ninku."
"That tactic, however, can put the parent in a submissive role and leave the child free to weigh the pros and cons of the request and then decide whether to comply." "Ichaqa chay hinata kamachiqtinkuqa yaqapaschá wawaqa mana kasunqachu."
"Rather than abdicate your authority, give clear direction in the form of statements. ​ — Bible principle: 1 Corinthians 14: 9." "Manan wawachu decidinan kasukunanchus icha manachus chaytaqa aswanpas sut’itan kamachina (Bibliaq yachachikuynin: 1 Corintios 14: 9)."
"Be decisive." "Rimasqaykita hunt’ay."
"If you say no, stick to that, and present a united front with your spouse." "Sichus wawaykita “manan ” nirqanki chayqa chay nisqaykita hunt’ay."
"If you have decided on a consequence for disobedience, follow through." "Qosaykiwan otaq esposaykiwan acuerdopi kaychis. Sichus castiganaykipaq nirqanki chayqa castigay."
"Do not get embroiled in negotiations or endlessly discuss why you made a decision." "Manan nishanachu kayta ruwanki chayqa manan castigasqaykichu nispaqa, nitaqmi nishutachu explicanayki imarayku castigasqaykitapas."
"It will be much easier for your child ​ — and for you — ​ if you just “let your ‘ Yes ’ mean yes and your ‘ No, ’ no. ” ​ — James 5: 12." "Allinmi kanqa wawaykipaq qanpaqpas sichus ‘ “arí ” nisqaykichis“ arí ” nisqa kanqa, “manan ” nisqaykichistaq“ manan ” nisqallataq kanqa ’ chayqa."
"Be loving." "Munakuq kay."
"The family is neither a democracy nor a dictatorship." "Familiapi umalliqqa manan capataz hinachu kamachinan nitaqmi wawakunapas ninanchu imayna kamachinanta."
"Rather, it is a God - given arrangement in which children can be lovingly guided toward responsible adulthood." "Diosqa familiata kamarqan wawakunata allinta yachachinankupaqmi."
"As part of that process, discipline will teach your child to obey and help him feel secure in your love." "Wanachiyqa wawakunata allin kanankupaq yachachiymi."
"Although we refer to the child as a male, the principles discussed in this article apply to girls as well." "Sichus wawaykita munakuywan wanachinki chayqa yanapankin kasukuq kananpaq munasqa seguro sientekunanpaqpas."
"“A child left unrestrained brings shame on his mother. ” ​ — Proverbs 29: 15." "“Ima munasqanta ruwananpaq hinallata qhawasqa wawan ichaqa mamanta p’enqachin ” (Proverbios 29: 15)"
"“Do not hold back discipline. ” ​ — Proverbs 23: 13." "“Wawachus wanachinapaq kaqtinqa, payta wanachiy ” (Proverbios 23: 13)"
"“Unless you... use speech that is easily understood, how will anyone know what is being said? ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 14: 9." "“Mana yachasqa simipi manachus sut’ita rimawaqchis chayqa, manan yachankumanchu ima nishasqaykichistapas ”"

"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"Human history is filled with violence." "Tukuy tiempo runaq kawsasqanpiqa kallarqanpunin maqanakuyqa."
"Will this tragic record continue indefinitely?" "¿Chhaynallapunichu kanqa?"
"Many, including religious people, feel that violence is a justifiable response to provocation." "Religioso runakunapas hukkunapas ninkun: “Manan huchachu pipas millayta tratawaqtinchis millayta kutichiyqa ”, nispa."
"And millions consider media violence to be an acceptable form of entertainment." "Millonninpi runakunan maqanakuymanta peliculakunata televisionpi qhawanku."
"Near the city of Mosul, in northern Iraq, lie the ruins of a once great city ​ — Nineveh, the capital of the ancient Assyrian Empire." "Irak nacionpin tarikun Mosul llaqta, chaypin tarikun Nínive hatun llaqtaq raqay - raqaynin, chayqa karqan Asiria nacionpa capitalninmi."
"While the city was still a thriving metropolis, the Bible foretold that God would “make Nineveh desolate. ”" "Chay Nínive llaqta aswan allin kashaqtinmi huk profeta willarqan Nínive llaqtata Dios purunyachinanta (Sofonías 2: 13)."
"“I will make a spectacle of you, ” God said. The reason? Nineveh was a“ city of bloodshed. ”" "Nínive llaqtaqa reqsisqan karqan “runa wañuchiq ” kasqanmanta, chaymi Dios castigarqan hukkunaq yachananpaq (Nahúm 1: 1; 3: 1, 6)."
"And “Jehovah detests violent... people, ” states Psalm 5: 6." "Nínive llaqtaq raqay - raqay kasqanmi rikuchin Diosqa runa wañuchiqkunata cheqnikusqanta castigasqanta ima (Salmo 5: 6)."
"As Nineveh’s ruins testify, God acted on his words." "Maqanakuytaqa Saqran paqarichirqan, Saqraqa Diospa enemigonmi runaq enemigon ima."
"Violence originated with the archenemy of both God and man ​ — Satan the Devil, whom Jesus Christ called “a murderer. ”" "Chaymi Jesuspas suticharqan “runa wañuchiq ” nispa."
"Moreover, because “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one, ” his traits are reflected in popular attitudes toward violence, including the world’s infatuation with media violence." "1 Juan 5: 19 texton willan ‘ lliw kay pacha saqraq munaychakusqan kasqanta ’. Chaychá runakunaqa ima hinaraq munanku maqanakuyta."
"To please God, we must cultivate a hatred for violence and a love for what God loves." "Diospa amigon kanapaqqa yachananchismi maqanakuy cheqnikuyta."
"* Is that possible?" "* ¿Atisunmanchu chay ruwayta?"
"“Jehovah... hates anyone who loves violence. ” ​ — Psalm 11: 5." "Diosqa “millay runakunatapas maqaylla maqaqkunatapas cheqnikunmi ” (Salmo 11: 5)"
"Violence is simply a reflection of human nature, which does not change." "Runakunaqa munanchispunin maqanakuyta, chay hina kasqanchistaqa manan cambiasunmanchu."
"Put away “wrath, anger, badness, abusive speech, and obscene talk. ”" "Diosmi kayta kamachiwanchis: “Tukuy kaykunata saqepuychis: k’arak phiñakuyta, phiñasqalla kayta, millay - kayta, tumpayta, qhelli rimayta. [...]"
"It also says: “Strip off the old personality with its practices, and clothe yourselves with the new personality. ”" "Millay ruwaykunatan wikch’upunkichisña, hinaspan mosoq runa - kaywan p’achawan hina churakunkichisña ”, nispa."
"Is God asking too much of us?" "¿Mana atinanchistachu Dios kamachiwanchis?"
No. Manan.
"People can change." "Llapanchispas atisunmanmi cambiayta."
"* How?" "* ¿Imaynata?"
"The first step is gaining an accurate knowledge of God." "Ñawpaqtaqa Diostan allinta reqsinanchis."
"When a person with a receptive heart learns about our Creator’s appealing qualities and standards, he is drawn to God in love and wants to please him. ​ — 1 John 5: 3." "Allin sonqoyoq runaqa Dios imayna kasqanta reqsispa kamachikuyninkuna allinninpaq kasqanta yachaspa iman, Diosta munakuyta qallarin kallpachakuntaqmi sonqonpaq hina kawsananpaq."
"The second step is related to our choice of associates." "Chaymantapas allintan amigonchiskunata akllakunanchis."
"“Do not keep company with a hot - tempered man or get involved with one disposed to rage, so that you never learn his ways and ensnare yourself. ” ​ — Proverbs 22: 24, 25. The third step involves insight." "Biblian niwanchis: “Ama phiñakuylla - phiñakuq runawanqa reqsinakuychu, ama saltaq sonqo runawanpas huñukuychu, paqtan imaynatachus kawsasqanta yachaqakuwaq ”, nispa (Proverbios 22: 24, 25)."
"See the inclination toward violence for what it is ​ — a serious weakness that reflects a lack of self - control." "Chaymantapas maqakuq runaqa pisi kallpa kasqantan rikuchin chaymi mana pay kikinta controlakunchu."
"The peaceable, by comparison, have inner strength." "Thakpi kawsaq runan ichaqa sonqonpi kallpayoq kasqanta rikuchin."
"“The one slow to anger is better than a mighty man, ” says Proverbs 16: 32." "Biblia nin: “Kallpasapamanta aswan allinqa mana usqhay phiñakuqmi ”, nispa (Proverbios 16: 32)."
"“Pursue peace with all people. ” ​ — Hebrews 12: 14." "“Tukuy runawan sumaq kawsayta munaychis ”"
"Violence has always been with us and always will be." "Kallarqanpunin maqanakuykunaqa manataqmi tukukunqapaschu."
"“Just a little while longer, and the wicked will be no more..." "“Pisi tiempomantaqa chinkapullanqan millay runakunaqa [...]."
"But the meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace. ”" "Llamp’u sonqokunan ichaqa kay hallp’ata chaskinqaku, sumaq thak - nisqataq tiyakunqaku ” (Salmo 37: 10, 11)."
"Yes, in order to save the meek and peaceable, God will do to lovers of violence what he did to ancient Nineveh." "Llamp’u sonqokuna humilde runakuna thakpi kawsanankupaqqa Diosmi millay runakunata Nínive llaqtapi runakunata hina tukuchinqa."
"Thereafter, violence will never again mar the earth! ​ — Psalm 72: 7." "Chay hinapin thak - kaylla kay pachapi kanqa (Salmo 72: 7)."
"“The mild - tempered... will inherit the earth. ” ​ — Matthew 5: 5" "“Llamp’u sonqoyoqkunaqa [...] kay pacha hallp’atan herenciapaq chaskinqaku ”"
"Now, therefore, is the time to seek God’s favor by cultivating a peaceful disposition." "Kunanmi tiempo kashan Dioswan allipunakapunanchispaq hukkunawan thakpi kawsayta yachananchispaqpas."
"Says 2 Peter 3: 9: “Jehovah... is patient with you because he does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance. ”" "2 Pedro 3: 9 texton nin: “[Diosqa] pacienciawan suyasunkichis, mana pitapas chinkananta munaspa, huchata saqespa payman llapa kutirikunankuta munaspa ”, nispa."
"“They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears. ” ​ — Isaiah 2: 4." "“Espadankumantapas yapuna rejakunatan ruwakapunqaku, lanzankunamantapas ichhunakunatan ruwakapunqaku ” (Isaías 2: 4)"
"God did allow ancient Israel to engage in war in order to defend its territory." "Diospa munayninpin Israel llaqtaqa maqanakurqan qorpankuta respetachikunankupaq (2 Crónicas 20: 15, 17)."
"That situation changed, however, when God terminated his covenant with Israel and established the Christian congregation, which has no borders." "Ichaqa Israel llaqtan Diosmanta karunchakapurqan, chaymi Diosqa mana qorpayoq cristiano iñiq t’aqata paqarichirqan, chaymi manaña necesarioñachu maqanakunankuqa."
"Examples of people who changed their ways can be found in the series “The Bible Changes Lives, ” featured in The Watchtower." "Qhawaq revistapin lloqsimun “Bibliaq yanapayninwan cambianku ” nisqa tema, chaypin tarinki askha runakunaq imayna cambiasqankumanta."
"HELP FOR THE FAMILY | MARRIAGE" "FAMILIAKUNAPAQ YANAPAYKUNA | CASARASQAKUNAPAQ"
"On the day you got married, you made a vow." "Casarakuqkunaqa huk compromisotan wañunankukama ruwanku."
"That solemn promise was a lifelong commitment ​ — a firm resolve to stick with your spouse and solve problems that would arise." "Chay compromisoqa karqan kuskalla kawsanankupaqmi problemakuna kaqtinpas kuska allichanankupaqmi."
"Over the years, however, the wear and tear of marital conflict has taken its toll." "Tiempoq pasasqanwan hinapaschá ichaqa sapa rato discutisqanku pisi - pisimanta karunchachipunman."
"Do you still feel as strongly committed to your mate?" "Yaqapaschá chay hinapi tarikuspa ninkuman: “Imapaqñataq kay hinapiri kawsayman aswanpas t’aqanakapusaq ”, nispa."
"Commitment is like an anchor that can keep your marriage steady" "Compromisoqa casarasqakunatan segurota sientechin imaynan anclapas allinta barcota sayachin hinata"
"Commitment is the solution, not the problem." "Manan compromiso ruwasqaykichischu problemaqa."
"Many people today are skeptical of commitment." "Askha runakunan mana munankuchu compromiso ruwayta."
"Some would compare commitment to a ball and chain that shackles you to a bad decision." "Wakinqa ninkun: “Mana allinta decidispapas comprometerqokuyman hinaspa ñakapakushayman ”, nispa."
"Instead, think of it as an anchor that can keep your marriage steady." "Ichaqa manan hinachu, aswanpas compromisoqa casarasqakunatan segurota sientechin imaynan anclapas allinta barcota sayachin hinata."
"A wife named Megan says, “During a conflict, one of the best things about commitment is knowing that neither you nor your spouse is leaving. ”" "Megan sutiyoq warmi nin: “Casarasqa kaspaqa manan t’aqanakuypichu mayqenpas piensan problema kaqtinqa ”, nispa."

"Your view of commitment might be influenced by what you observed in your parents." "Yaqapaschá compromiso ruwaytaqa pisi tiempollapaq qhawarinki tayta - mamaykiq t’aqanakusqanrayku."
"“My parents divorced when I was growing up, ” says a wife named Lea,“ and I worry that their experience may have left me with a negative view of commitment. ” Be assured that you can make things different in your own marriage."

"Examine your speech." "Ama hawan ukhuntachu rimay."

"Allipunaymantaqa manan iskayanichu; ichaqa chay ratopi mana allichayta atinichu chayllan ’, nispa ” (2003 watamanta La Atalaya, 15 setiembre killamanta)."
"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"Despite the widely extolled virtues of marital fidelity, adultery continues to wreak havoc in many families." "Yaqa llapa runakunan yachanku qosankuwan otaq esposankuwan fiel kasqankuqa allinninkupaq kasqanta. Ichaqa wasanchay huchaqa ñak’arichishallanmi familiakunata."
"Some cultures do not view extramarital sex, especially on the part of husbands, as wrong." "Wakin llaqtakunapiqa normal - llan casarasqa qharikuna wasanchay hucha ruwasqankuqa."
"And some do not consider marriage to be a permanent union." "Wakinkunataq piensanku casarakuyqa huk ratollapaq kasqanta."
"In the Bible, adultery generally refers to voluntary sexual relations by a married person ​ — either a man or a woman — ​ with someone other than his or her mate." "Bibliapiqa “wasanchay hucha ” nispan nikun huk qhari otaq huk warmi casarasqa kashaspa hukwan yuyaypi pantaqtan (Job 24: 15; Proverbios 30: 20)."
"Adultery is a detestable thing in God’s eyes." "Diosqa wasanchay huchataqa millakunmi."
"In ancient Israel the penalty for it was death." "Chaymi Israel llaqtaman kamachirqan wasanchay hucha ruwaqkunata wañuchinankupaq (Levítico 18: 20, 22, 29)."
"Jesus taught that his followers must refrain from adultery. ​ — Matthew 5: 27, 28; Luke 18: 18 - 20." "Jesuspas qatikuqninkunatan nirqan ama wasanchay huchata ruwanankupaq."
"Adulterers break the solemn vow that they made to their spouse at the time of their marriage." "Wasanchay huchata ruwaqkunaqa casarakuspa compromiso ruwasqankutan p’akinku."
"It is also a “sin against God. ”" "Chaymantapas wasanchay huchaqa ‘ Dios contra huchallikuymi ’ (Génesis 39: 7 - 9)."
"Adultery can cruelly separate children from parents." "Wawakunapas sufrinkun mamankumanta otaq papankumanta t’aqakapuspa."
"What is more, the Bible warns that “God will judge... adulterers. ” ​ — Hebrews 13: 4." "Chaymi Biblia kayta nin: “Qhelli huchapi puriqkunatan wasanchaqkunatawanmi Diosqa huchachanqa ”, nispa."
"“Let marriage be honorable among all, and let the marriage bed be without defilement. ” ​ — Hebrews 13: 4." "“Casarakuytaqa lliwlla ancha allinpaq hap’ichunku, casarasqakunapas amataq wasanchanakuchunkuchu ”"
"The Bible allows for a married person to terminate his or her marital union on the grounds of a mate’s sexual immorality." "Bibliaqa ninmi wasanchay hucha kallaqtin divorciakunamanta."
"This is a personal decision. ​ — Galatians 6: 5." "Chaytaqa mana huchayoq kaqmi decidinan."
"On the other hand, in God’s eyes marriage is a sacred lifelong bond." "Ichaqa manan pipas ninmanchu divorciakunanta otaq mana divorciakunantapas."
"God hates it when a person seeks a divorce that is based on trivial reasons, such as simply not being satisfied with a mate." "Diosninchisqa casarakuytaqa ancha valorniyoqtan qhawarin, manataqmi huk ratollapaqpaschu."
"Therefore, a decision regarding divorce is not to be taken lightly. ​ — Malachi 2: 16; Matthew 19: 3 - 6." "Chay hinaqa, manan pipas munasqanraykullachu divorciakunan (Malaquías 2: 16; Mateo 19: 3 - 6)."
"“I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of sexual immorality, makes her a subject for adultery. ” ​ — Matthew 5: 32. No." "“Pipas t’aqanasqa warmiwan casarakuqqa wasanchay huchatan ruwan ”"
"The Bible says that God shows mercy to those who repent and turn around from their sins ​ — including adultery." "Wasanchay huchaqa manan mana perdonanapaq hinachu."
"In fact, the Bible talks about men and women who stopped committing adultery and later became God’s friends. ​ — 1 Corinthians 6: 9 - 11." "Jehová Diosqa perdonarqanmi wasanchay huchaman urmaq warmi qharikunata huchankumanta arrepientekusqankurayku qhelli hucha saqepusqankurayku ima."
"God’s mercy was shown in the case of King David of ancient Israel." "Chay runakunaqa Diospa amigonmi kapurqanku. Yachanapaq rey Davidmanta yachasun."
"David committed adultery with the wife of one of his army officers." "Payqa casadon karqan ichaqa wasanchay huchamanmi urmaykurqan (2 Samuel 11: 2 - 4)."
"The Bible clearly states that “what David had done was very displeasing ” to God." "Biblia nin: “Davidpa chay ruwasqanmi ichaqa Señor Diospa ñawpaqenpi mana chaninchu karqan ”, nispa (2 Samuel 11: 27)."
"After receiving reproof, David repented and God forgave him." "Huchanta reparachisqanku qhepamanmi Davidqa arrepientekurqan Diostaq perdonarqan."
"Nonetheless, David had to suffer the sad consequences of his actions." "Chhaynaña karqan chaypas Davidqa huchan hawan ñak’arirqan (2 Samuel 12: 13,14)."
"Wise King Solomon later attested that “anyone committing adultery... is lacking good sense. ” ​ — Proverbs 6: 32." "Qhepamanmi rey Salomón nirqan: “Wasancha huchallikuqmi ichaqa mana yuyayniyoq, chayta ruwaqqa pay kikintan waqllichikun [k’irikun] ”, nispa (Proverbios 6: 32)."
"If you have committed adultery, you need to ask both God and your spouse for forgiveness." "Wasanchay huchapi urmarqanki chayqa Diosmanta parejaykimantapas perdonta mañakuy (Salmo 51: 1 - 5)."
"Learn to hate adultery as God does." "Cheqnikuy wasanchay huchata imaynan Diospas cheqnikun hinata (Salmo 97: 10)."
"Be determined to avoid pornography, sexual fantasies, flirting, or anything else that could lead you to have sexual interest in someone other than your mate. ​ — Matthew 5: 27, 28; James 1: 14, 15." "Ama qhawaychu pornografiata amataq piensaychu qhelli hucha ruwaypi, ama hukta thintipayaychu amataq imatapas ruwaychu huk runa munapayanasunkipaq hinaqa."
"If you have been the victim of your mate’s adultery, be assured that God understands your feelings." "Qosayki otaq esposayki hukwan pantarqan chayqa, Diosqa chay hinapi tarikusqaykitaqa entiendenmi (Malaquías 2: 13, 14)."
"Ask for his tender comfort and guidance, and “he will sustain you. ”" "Yanapayta mañakuy, Biblian nin: “Diosman llakipakuyniykikunata saqey, paymi qaqata sayachisunki ”, nispa (Salmo 55: 22)."
"If you choose to forgive your mate and continue your marriage, both of you will need to work hard to rebuild your marital bond. ​ — Ephesians 4: 32." "Sichus perdonanki chayqa iskayniykichismi kallpachakunaykichis hukmanta sumaqta kawsanaykichispaq."
"“Jehovah, in turn, forgives your sin, ” said the prophet Nathan to repentant David after his adultery. ​ — 2 Samuel 12: 13." "“Huchaykikunatan Señor Dios pampachasunki ” nispan nirqan profeta Natán rey Davidta wasanchay hucha ruwasqanmanta arrepientekuqtin (2 Samuel 12: 13)"
"WATCHING THE WORLD" "PACHANTINMANTA WILLAKUYKUNA"
"Although the earth produces clean air, nourishing food, and fresh water, humans are increasingly disrupting these natural processes." "Kay pachapiqa kanmi unu, aire, mikhuna ima."
"Scientists are desperately seeking solutions to reverse this trend." "Ichaqa runakunan kay pachata nishuta malograpushanku."
"It is estimated that as much as 120,000 cubic miles (500,000 cu km) of low - salinity water lies beneath the floor of the world’s oceans." "Cientificokunaqa imaymanatan ruwashanku kay pacha mana malograkunanpaq."
"“The sea level was [once] much lower than it is today, ” says Vincent Post of Flinders University in Adelaide, so the coastline was farther out." "Lamar - qochaq ukhu pachanpin unu p’ampasqa kashan medio millón kilómetros cúbicos hina, chay unuqa pisi kachillayoqmi."
"At that time, rain would “fill up the water table in areas that are nowadays under the sea. ”" "Adelaida llaqtapi Universidadmanta Vincent Post runan nin: “Ñawpaqpiqa lamar - qochaqa aswan ukhupin karqan ch’aki hallp’ataqmi aswan hatun karqan ”, nispa."

"Half the large animal species once found in the Sahara have either disappeared or are now confined to only 1 percent or less of their original range." "Chay sitiopi llapa clase animalkunamanta kuskan hinas manaña kawsankuñachu otaq huk partechallapiña tiyashanku. ¿Imaraykun chaykuna pasashan?"
"Regional instability and widespread hunting are only partly to blame." "Gobiernoq mana allinta kamachikusqanraykun, chaymantapas animal hap’iqkunan mana khuyapayaspa wañuchipushanku."
"Although the biodiversity of deserts rivals that of forests, researchers say that “the lack of scientific attention given to desert biodiversity is mirrored by a lack of financial support. ”" "Montekunapi hinaña imaymana animalkuna chay aqo pampapi kan chaypas investigaqkunaq nisqanman hinaqa “manan interés kanchu cuidanankupaq qolqewan apoyanankupaqpas ”."
"As a result, it is difficult for conservationists to monitor endangered desert ecosystems." "Chaypi kaq animalkuna peligropiña chinkananpaq kashan chaypas investigaqkunaqa mana imatapas ruwayta atinkuchu."
"It has been estimated that 1 in 8 deaths in 2012 occurred as a result of air pollution." "2012 watapiqa pusaq wañuqmantas huk runa wañusqa aire contaminasqa kasqanrayku."
"According to the World Health Organization, “air pollution is now the world’s largest single environmental health risk. ”" "Organización Mundial de la Salud nisqan nin: “Aire contaminasqa kasqanwanmi runakuna astawan onqoshanku ”, nispa."
"TO THINK ABOUT: Why are hardworking people with noble goals unable to stop the destruction of our environment? ​ — Jeremiah 10: 23." "KAYPI PIENSAY: Askha runakunaña kallpachakushanku kay pachata cuidanankupaq chaypas, ¿imaraykun manan atinkuchu? (Jeremías 10: 23.)"

"COVER SUBJECT" "QALLARIYPI KAQ"
"THERE is a saying, “Money makes the world go round. ”" "RIMAYPIN ninku: “Qolqellawanmi tukuy imapas atikun ”, nispa."
"There is some truth to that statement. After all, it takes money to buy food, obtain clothing, and pay for rent or buy a home." "Arí, qolqewanmi mikhunatapas p’achatapas rantinchis, qolqewanmi wasita alquilanchis otaq rantinchispas."
"“The role of money in society is incredibly important, ” writes one financial editor.“ If money was removed as a means of exchange, we would be in a state of panic and war within a month. ”" "Huk periodicomanta directormi nirqan: “Qolqeqa ancha importanten kawsananchispaq, sichus qolqe mana servipunmanchu chayqa, runakunachá mana imanakuytapas atinkumanchu, ratochá tukuy ladokunapi guerrakuna qallarinman ”, nispa."
"Of course, money has its limitations." "Ichaqa qolqeqa manan tukuypichu yanapawanchis."
"Norwegian poet Arne Garborg said that with money “you can buy food, but not appetite; medicine, but not health; soft beds, but not sleep; knowledge, but not wisdom; glitter, but not beauty; splendor, but not warmth; fun, but not joy; acquaintances, but not friends; servants, but not faithfulness. ”" "Noruega nacionmanta Arne Garborg runan qelqarqan: “Rantiwaqmi mikhunata ichaqa manan mikhuy munaytaqa; rantiwaqmi hampikunata ichaqa manan saludtaqa; rantiwaqmi camata ichaqa manan misk’i puñuytaqa [...]; askha runakunatan reqsiwaq ichaqa manan allin amigokunataqa; kanmanmi kamachiykikuna ichaqa manan sonqomanta kasukuqniykikunaqa ”, nispa."
"When a person maintains a balanced view of money ​ — regarding it as a means to an end rather than an end in itself ​ — it is possible to enjoy a greater measure of contentment." "Manan qolqeta tarinapaqchu kawsananchisqa, aswanpas qolqeqa huk herramienta hinan kanan kawsayninchispi yanapawananchispaq."
"The Bible warns that “the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have... stabbed themselves all over with many pains. ” ​ — 1 Timothy 6: 10." "Biblian niwanchis: “Qolqe sonqo - kaymi tukuy mana allinkunaq saphinqa, chaymi wakinkunapas chayta munapakuspanku iñiyta saqepurqanku, hinaspan imaymana llakikunapi rikukurqanku ”, nispa."
"Note that it is the love of money ​ — not money itself — ​ that brings harm." "Chaypi nisqan hina, manan qolqechu llakikuykunataqa apamun, aswanpas qolqe sonqo kaymi."
"Indeed, an inordinate focus on money can drive a wedge between friends and between family members." "Qolqeta sinchita munakuyqa amigokunata familiakunatan t’aqanachin."
"Daniel: * “I always thought of my friend Thomas as a pleasant and honest person." "Daniel nin: * “Amigoy Tomasqa honradon karqan."
"I never had any problem with him until he bought my used car. I wasn’t aware that there was anything wrong with the car. Still, he agreed in writing to buy the car as is." "Manan ima problemaykupas kaqchu, ichaqa carroytan payman venderqani, manan imanpas malograsqachu karqan, paypas acuerdon karqan rantisqanwan, ichaqa kinsa killa qhepamanmi malograkapusqa."
"Three months later the car broke down. Thomas felt cheated and angrily insisted that I return his money." "Tomasqa engañashaymanpas hinatan piensarqan, chaymi phiñasqa niwarqan qolqenta kutichipunaypaq."
"I was shocked! When I tried to reason with him, he became belligerent and hostile." "Huk hinamanmi tukupurqan, rimayta munaqtiypas nishutan phiñakapurqan."
"When money became an issue, he was no longer the amiable Thomas I knew. ”" "Qolqeq causanpin manaña amigontinñachu kapurqayku ”, nispa."
"Esin: “Nesrim is my only sibling." "Clara nin: “Soniaqa sapallan hermanaymi."
"We always got along, so I never thought that our relationship could be damaged over money." "Paywanqa allintan kawsarqayku, ichaqa qolqeq causanpin ñoqapaq phiñasqa kashan."
"But that’s exactly what happened." "Tayta - mamaykuqa huk herenciatan saqewarqanku igualta t’aqanakunaykupaq."
"When my parents died, they left us a small inheritance and stipulated that the money was to be divided equally between us." "Ichaqa hermanayqa manan respetayta munarqanchu tayta - mamaykuq decidisqanta, maswanmi qhepakuyta munarqan."
"My sister went against my parents ’ wishes and demanded more than her share." "Chayta mana munaqtiymi nishuta phiñakurqan, amenazawarqan imaraqmi."
"To this day, she remains bitterly resentful of me. ”" "Kunankamapas payqa phiñasqan ñoqapaq kashan ”, nispa."
"A distorted view of money can cause people to become judgmental." "Qolqeta nishu importantepaq qhawarispaqa hukkunatan criticasunman."
"For example, a wealthy person might assume that those who are poor are too lazy to better themselves." "Yaqapaschá qolqeyoq runaqa ninman: “Pobrekunaqa qellakunan kanku ”, nispa."
"Or a person with lesser means might hastily conclude that those who have more are materialistic or greedy." "Pobre runapas ninmanpaschá: “Qhapaqkunaqa qolqe sonqon kanku, qolqellapin piensanku ”, nispa."
"Leanne, a teenager in a relatively wealthy family, was a victim of that type of prejudice. She relates:" "Laura sipaschaqa qhapaq familiamantan, paytaqa chay hinatan criticarqanku."
"The Bible’s counsel regarding money is as relevant today as when it was written" "Kay tiempopipas Bibliapi yachachikuykunaqa yanapawanchismi"
"“I used to be known as the girl whose father makes loads of money." "Ninmi: “Runakunaqa qhapaqpa wawanmantan reqsiwarqanku."
"So I often got comments such as: ‘ If you want something, all you have to do is ask Daddy ’ or ‘ Sorry we aren’t all rich and can afford nice cars like your family. ’" "Askha kutipin burlakuspa niwaqku: ‘ Qhapaqpa wawanqa, riki, ima munasqantayá rantichikun ’, ‘ manayá llapallaykuchu familiayki hina carroyoq kayta atiyku ’, nispa."
"I finally asked my friends to stop saying those things, and I explained to them why their words hurt me." "Amigoykunatan nirqani ama chhaynata niwanankupaq. Willarqanin chaykuna malta sientechiwasqanta."
"I wanted to be known, not as a person who has money, but as someone who does kind things for others. ”" "Sumaq sonqo kasqaymantan reqsiwanankuta munarqani amataq qolqeyoq kasqaymantachu ”, nispa."
"The Bible neither condemns money nor criticizes those who have it ​ — even a lot of it." "Bibliaqa manan mana allinpaqchu qhawarichin qolqetaqa nitaqmi qhapaqkunatapas criticanchu."
"The point is not the amount a person has but his attitude toward what he has or wants to acquire." "Problemaqa manan hayk’a qolqeyoq kaychu, aswanpas imatachus qolqemanta piensasqanchismi, qolqewan imatachus ruwasqanchismi."
"The Bible’s counsel regarding money is balanced, and it is as relevant today as when it was written." "Kay tiempopipas Bibliapi yachachikuykunaqa yanapawanchismi, yachasun wakinmanta."
"THE BIBLE SAYS: “Do not wear yourself out to gain wealth. ” ​ — Proverbs 23: 4." "BIBLIAN NIN: “Qhapaqyanaykipaq ama afanakuychu ”, nispa (Proverbios 23: 4)."
"According to the book The Narcissism Epidemic, people who pursue wealth are more apt to “suffer from poor mental health; they also report more physical health problems such as sore throats, backaches, and headaches and were more likely to drink too much alcohol and use illegal drugs." "Huk libroq nisqanman hinaqa aswan qolqeyoq kayta munaq runakunaqa “llakisqan kanku; kunkanku, wasanku, umanku iman nanan."
"Striving for financial success, apparently, makes people miserable. ”" "Hinaspapas nishutan tragota ukyanku, drogakunku iman."
"THE BIBLE SAYS: “Let your way of life be free of the love of money, while you are content with the present things. ” ​ — Hebrews 13: 5." "Qhapaqyayta munaqkunaqa llakisqan kawsanku ” (The Narcissism Epidemic)."
"A person who is content is not immune to financial anxiety; however, he knows how to put his anxiety in perspective." "BIBLIAN NIN: “Ama qolqe sonqo kaychischu, kunan imachus kapusunkichis chayllawan kusisqa kawsaychis ”, nispa."
"For example, a content person will not overreact to financial loss." "Kapuqnillanwan kusikuq runapas piensanmi qolqepi, ichaqa manan qolqechu paypaqqa aswan importante."
"Rather, he will strive to have the attitude of the apostle Paul, who wrote: “I know how to be low on provisions and how to have an abundance." "Ejemplopaq, qolqen pisiqtinqa manan sinchitachu chaymanta llakikun."
"In everything and in all circumstances I have learned the secret of both how to be full and how to hunger, both how to have an abundance and how to do without. ” ​ — Philippians 4: 12." "Apóstol Pablo hinan piensan: “Yachanin wakcha kawsayta, yachallanitaqmi allin qhapaq hina kawsaytapas, imayna kawsaypiña rikukuspaypas yachasqan kani: saksasqa kaspapas, yarqasqa kaspapas, askha kawsayniyoq kaspapas, pisi kawsayniyoq kaspapas ”, nispa."
"THE BIBLE SAYS: “The one trusting in his riches will fall. ” ​ — Proverbs 11: 28." "BIBLIAN NIN: “Qhapaq kayninman k’askakuqqa urmaykunqan ”, nispa (Proverbios 11: 28)."
"Researchers cite money problems as a common factor in marital strife resulting in divorce." "Chaykunamanta yachaq runakunaq nisqanman hinaqa, askha casarasqakunan t’aqanakunku qolqeq causanmanta."
"Money problems have also been a factor in suicide." "Wakinqa mana qolqeyoq rikukuspankun wañuchikunku."
"For some people, money is more important than their marriage vows or even their life!" "Wakinpaqqa qolqen aswan importante qosankumanta esposankumanta otaq kikin vidankumantapas."
"In contrast, those who have a balanced view do not put their trust in money." "Ichaqa qolqe ganayllapiña mana afanakuqkunaqa kusisqan kawsanku, manan qolqemantachu dependenku kusisqa kanankupaqqa."
"Instead, they recognize the wisdom of Jesus ’ words: “Even when a person has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses. ” ​ — Luke 12: 15." "Reparankun Jesuspa kay nisqanta: “Runaq kawsayninqa manan askha kaqniyoq kaspallachu allin kanqa ”, nispa."
"A self - examination might alert you to the need to acquire a balanced view of money." "Qatiqninpin tapuykuna kashan sonqonchista t’aqwikunanchispaq, yaqapaschá imayna piensasqanchista cambiananchis kanqa."
"For example, ask yourself the following questions." "¿Facil - llatachu qolqe ganayta munani?"

"As a young man, he witnessed firsthand the horrors of war and asked, “If there is an almighty Creator, why would he permit such conditions to afflict so many people, especially innocent children? ”" "Wayna kashaspaqa rikurqanmi guerrapi runakunaq sufrisqanta, hinan tapukurqan: “Kantaq tukuy atiyniyoq Dios chayqa, ¿imaraykun runakuna sufrinku, astawanqa wawakuna? ”, nispa."
"Despite his university education and his examination of various religions, Harry’s questions persisted." "Harryqa universidadpin estudiarqan, askha religionkunamantan yacharqanpas, chaywanpas manan tarirqanchu Diosmanta tapukuyninkunaq kutichiyninta."

Harry Harry
"Harry kept an open mind when he heard what the Bible had to say on the matter." "Payqa Bibliapin maskharqan tapukusqankunaq kutichiyninta."
"He learned that God is not the source of wickedness; rather, God hates it and feels pain when others suffer." "Chaypin yacharqan Diosqa mana huchayoqchu sufrimientomanta kasqanta, aswanpas cheqnikunmi, anchatataqmi sonqonpas nanan runakuna sufriqtinqa (Proverbios 6: 16 - 19; Isaías 63: 9; Santiago 1: 13)."
"Harry found out that ultimately all pain and suffering can be traced to humans ’ rejecting God’s authority and using their free will to decide for themselves what is right and what is wrong. He also saw that God did not stand back and take an ‘ I told you so ’ posture." "Harryqa kaykunatan entiendellarqantaq: Adanwan Evawanmi Dios contra hatarirqanku, imayna kawsaytapas paykuna kikinkun decidirqanku, chhaynapin tukuy sufrimiento qallarirqan (Deuteronomio 32: 4, 5; Santiago 1: 14, 15)."
"Instead, God immediately set in motion arrangements to eradicate wickedness and suffering." "Huchanku hawaña runakuna chhaynapi tarikuqtinkupas Diosqa mana hinatachu saqerparirqan."
"He will completely undo all the damage that has been done." "Diosqa kikin ratopin willarqan chay sufrimientota chinkachinanpaq imata ruwananta."
"Harry came to realize that in the meantime, God has provided comfort and support to help individuals endure. ​ — Genesis 3: 15; Romans 8: 20, 21; Revelation 21: 4." "Chay p’unchay chayamunankamaqa Diosqa kallpatan qowanchis aguantananchispaq (Génesis 3: 15; Romanos 8: 20, 21; Apocalipsis 21: 4)."
"These answers did more than satisfy Harry’s curiosity about a fundamental question. They helped him to weather the emotional turmoil he later experienced when tragedy touched him personally." "Harryqa Bibliapin tarirqan tapukuyninkunaq kutichiyninta, familianpi huk desgracia kasqanta atipananpaqpas Biblian yanaparqan."
"WAS IT DESIGNED?" "¿KIKILLANMANTACHU PAQARIMURQAN?"
"THE Australian thorny devil lizard (Moloch horridus) extracts moisture from fog, humidity, and wet sand." "AUSTRALIA nacionpi kaq khiska - khiska qarayoq saqra qaraywaqa (Moloch horridus) pacha phuyumanta, unuyoq aqo pampamantan unuta ch’onqan."
"Then it channels the water to its mouth for drinking. How?" "Imaynata ruwasqanmanta yachanapaq yachasun qaran imayna kasqanmanta."
"The answer may lie in the lizard’s amazing skin. Grooves on the surface of the skin are connected to a network of channels below the skin so that water is directed to the sides of the thorny devil’s mouth" "Saqra qaraywaq qaran patapiqa unuq purinanpaq hinan wachu - wachukuna kan, chaytaqmi tupanasqa kashan qaranpa ukhunpi kaq wachu - wachukunawan, chaynintan siminkama unu chayan"
"Consider: The thorny devil’s skin is overlaid with scales." "Kaypi piensay: Saqra qaraywaq qaranqa khiska - khiska hinan."
"Some scientists think that moisture or dew collected on the scales runs down to the rough surface of the skin and enters the skin’s network of half - open channels, or grooves, located between the scales." "Yachaqkunaq nisqanman hinaqa, sullapas chay khiskanmanmi chayan, hinan qaran ukhupi kaq unuq purinanpaq wachukunaman haykun, chay wachu - wachuntan siminkama unu chayan ukyananpaq."
"But how does this lizard draw up water ​ — up its legs, across its body, and into its mouth — ​ defying gravity in the process?" "¿Ichaqa imaynatan chakinmanta hasta siminkama unu chayan?"
"And how does the thorny devil extract moisture from wet surfaces by rubbing its belly against them?" "¿Imaynatan unupas siminman chayan humedo pampapi wiksanta qhetuqtin?"
"The channels on the surface of the skin are connected by way of ducts to another network of channels below, that is, within the lizard’s skin." "Yachaqkunaq nisqanman hinaqa, qaran patapi kaq unuq purinanpaq wachu - wachukunan tupanasqa kashan qaranpa ukhunpi kaq wachu - wachukunawan."
"The structure of these channels enables capillary action ​ — a phenomenon in which water is drawn into narrow spaces even against the force of gravity." "Chay wachu - wachukuna imayna ruwasqa kasqanraykun unupas wichayman puriyta atin."
"The lizard’s skin thus acts as a sponge." "Chay qaraywaq wasanqa huk esponja hinan."
"Janine Benyus, president of the Biomimicry Institute, says that mimicking moisture - extracting technologies may help engineers design a system to remove humidity from air in order to cool buildings more efficiently and also to obtain drinking water."

"The end will come in two main stages." "Kay pachaq tukupuyninqa chayamunqa iskay etapapin."
"First, God will destroy organized false religion, portrayed as a prostitute named “Babylon the Great. ”" "Ñaupaqtaqa, llapa pantasqa religionkunatan Dios chinkachinqa, Biblian chay pantasqa religionkunata comparan ‘ rabona warmiwan ’, sutichantaqmi “Jatun Babilonia ” nispa."
"While professing loyalty to God, she has consorted with the world’s political leaders." "“Diostan serviyku ” ninkuña chaypas kay pachapi kamachikuqkunawanmi pantay ñanpi purin."
"“[They] will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated and naked, and they will eat up her flesh [or, riches] and completely burn her with fire. ” ​ — Revelation 17: 16." "Ichaqa chay kamachikuqkunallataqmi contranpi jatarinqaku, jinan “rabona warmita cheqninqaku."
"Next, God will turn his attention to the political rulers themselves ​ — “the kings of the entire inhabited earth. ”" "Jinaspa qechunqaku, llat’ananqaku, aychantapas mijunqaku, ninawantaq ruphaykachinqaku ”."
"Along with wicked people in general, these will be destroyed in “the war of the great day of God the Almighty, ” also called“ Armageddon. ” ​ — Revelation 16: 14, 16." "Iskay kaq etapapiqa ‘ Diospa jatun taripay p’unchayninpin ’ kay pachapi gobiernokunapas millay runakunapas wañuchisqa kanqaku, chaytan Biblia sutichallantaq “Armagedón ” nispa."
"“Seek Jehovah, all you meek ones of the earth..." "“Llapa k’umuykukuqkuna [...]"

"Diospa gobiernonmi kay pachapi llapa gobiernokunaq rantinpi kamachipunqa, chayta llapa runakunaman willakusqan qhepamanmi kay pachaq tukupuyninqa chayamunqa (Daniel 7: 13, 14)."

"That preaching work, which reflects God’s justice and mercy, is part of a composite “sign ” marking the time of the end. The sign also includes international warfare, earthquakes, famine, and disease. ​ — Matthew 24: 3; Luke 21: 10, 11." "Predicakusqanqa Diospa justicianta khuyapayakuynintawanmi rikuchin; pachantinpi guerrakunapas, terremotokunapas, yarqaypas, onqoykunapas predicakusqanpas juj señalmi kay pacha chinkapunanpaq."
"Besides foretelling world events, the Bible also gives us a social profile of “the last days. ”" "Bibliaqa willallantaqmi ‘ tukukuy qaylla p’unchaykunapi ’ runakuna imayna kananta."
"We read: “Critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money,... disobedient to parents,... without self - control, fierce, without love of goodness,... lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God. ”" "Biblia nin: “Runakunan kanqa paykuna kikinkuta munakuqkuna, qolqe sonqokuna [...], tayta - mamankuta mana kasuqkuna [...], aychankuq munaynillanta ruwaqkuna, millay yana alma runakuna, tukuy allinkaqta cheqnikuqkuna [...]"

"All those conditions mark the era that began about the time of World War I in 1914." "Chay señalkunan rikukuyta qallariran 1914 watapi Primera Guerra Mundial kasqan qhepaman."
"Moreover, since that year, God’s Kingdom has been announced in every corner of the earth, and Jehovah’s Witnesses count it an honor to be closely identified with this work." "Chaymantapas chay watamantapachan Diospa gobiernonmanta tukuy ladokunapi willakushan. Jehová Diospa testigonkunaqa reqsisqan kanku pachantinpi predicasqankuwan."

"What may begin as a calm exchange of thoughts can quickly spiral into a verbal slugging match." "Mayninpiqa munayta rimayta qallarispapas discutinkun."

"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMA NINMI BIBLIA?"
"Religions provide various conflicting opinions about the soul and what happens to it when we die." "Religionkunaqa manan kaqllatachu yachachinku wañupuqkunawan imachus pasasqanmanta."
"In fact, it often speaks of the soul as dying." "Biblian ichaqa sut’ita willawanchis."
"On another occasion, the Bible uses the term “dead soul ” to describe a corpse." "Askha runakunan ninku: “Wañupuspaqa juj ladopin kausashallanchis ”, nispa."
"Clearly, the Bible does not teach that the soul is immortal. “The soul who sins is the one who will die. ” ​ — Ezekiel 18: 20." "Wakinqa creenkun “wañupusqanchis qhepamanqa jujpa cuerponpin kausanchis ” nisqa yachachikuypi, chayqa reencarnación yachachikuymi."
"The Bible describes a mother as giving birth to “souls ” ​ — that is, living, breathing persons." "Wakintaqmi creenku “wañupuspaqa cielomanmi otaq infiernomanmi ripusun ” nisqa yachachikuypi."
"In fact, the Hebrew word used in the Bible for “soul ” can be translated“ a breather. ”" "Bibliaqa manan maypipas ninchu “wañupuqkunaqa juj ladopin kausashallanku ” nispaqa."
"Sometimes the term is even used to designate animals. Furthermore, the Bible describes the soul as needing food." "Aswanpas ninmi wañupuqkunaqa allpaman tukupusqankuta, chhaynaqa manan cuerpoq ima partenpas kausanñachu."
"In the Bible the word “soul ” most often refers to a complete living person, including the body, the emotions, and the personality." "Maypachachus Adán juchallikuran chayqa Diosqa sut’itan willaran wañupuspaqa allpamanta kamasqa kasqanman tukupunanpaq."
"“She bore... 16 persons [or,“ souls, ” footnote]. ” ​ — Genesis 46: 18." "“Ñut’u allpan kanki, ñut’u allpamantaqmi tukupunki ” (Génesis 3: 19)"
"As surely as our bodies perish at death, “there is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the Grave. ”" "Bibliaqa sut’itan willan cuerpo wañuqtinqa mana ima partenpas kausasqanta."
"The Scriptures definitively tell us that when someone dies, “he returns to the ground; on that very day his thoughts perish. ”" "“Wañuy - pachapiqa manan ima llank’anapas yuyanapas reqsinapas yachanapas kanchu ” (Eclesiastés 9: 10)."
"A dead soul is in a state of inactivity, and thus, the Scriptures often metaphorically refer to the dead as “sleeping. ” ​ — Matthew 9: 24." "Wañupuspaqa runaqa “allpamanmi tukupun, chay p’unchaypachan yuyaykusqankunaqa chinkapun ” (Salmo 146: 4)."
"When you lose those you love in death, you want to know the answers to such questions as these: Where are they? What state are they in?" "Wañupuspaqa runaqa manan imatapas reparanñachu, chayraykun Bibliaqa wañusqakunata “puñushanmi ” nin."
"Are they suffering? Since the Bible assures us that the dead are unconscious, we can be comforted in knowing that our dead loved ones are not suffering anymore." "Sichus pi reqsisqaykipas wañupun chayqa yachaytachá munayki maypi kashasqanta sufrishanchu icha manachu chaytapas."
"We can be further comforted in knowing that Jehovah promises to awaken unconscious, dead souls back to life at a future time. ​ — Isaiah 26: 19." "Bibliaq nisqanman jinaqa wañusqakunaqa manan imatapas reparankuñachu nitaqmi sufrishankupaschu (Isaías 26: 19)."
"“The dead know nothing at all. ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 9: 5." "“Wañukapuqkunan ichaqa mana imatapas yachankuchu ” (Eclesiastés 9: 5)"
"WAS IT DESIGNED?" "¿KIKILLANMANTACHU PAQARIMURAN?"
"AMONG the numerous mechanisms that make human life possible is the body’s ability to heal wounds and regenerate damaged tissue." "CUERPOPI heridakunaqa kikillanmi thanipun, chhaynapin kausaynillayoq kanchis."
"The process begins as soon as an injury occurs." "Kuchurukuqtinchis jinan heridaqa thaniyta qallarin."
"Consider: The healing process is made possible by a cascade of complex cellular functions:" "Kaypi piensay: Juj heridaqa khaynatan thanin."
"Platelets adhere to tissues around a wound, forming a blood clot and sealing damaged blood vessels." "Yawarninchispi plaquetakunan heridaq kasqanpi juñukuspa yawarta tikayachin mana lloqsinanpaq."
"Inflammation protects against infection and removes any “debris ” caused by the injury." "Heridaq punkisqanqa yanapanmi mana infección kananpaq, qˈeapas lloqsimunanpaq."
"Within days, the body begins to replace injured tissue, make the wound contract, and repair damaged blood vessels. Finally, scar tissue remodels and strengthens the damaged area." "Pisi pˈunchaykunallamantan heridapiqa aycha jujmanta wiñamun, heridapas wisqˈakapun, yawarpas manaña lloqsipunñachu."
"Inspired by blood clotting, researchers are developing plastics that can “heal ” damage to themselves." "Chaymantaqa herida chˈakiqtinqa kaq lluspˈan aychaqa quedapun, mana ­ kichakunanpaq jinataqmi thanipunpas."
"Such regenerating materials are equipped with tiny parallel tubes containing two chemicals that “bleed ” when any damage occurs." "Chayta rikuspan investigaq runakunaqa ruwaranku llikˈikuspa kikillan wisqˈakuq plasticokunata."
"As the two chemicals mix, they form a gel that spreads across the damaged areas, closing cracks and holes." "Chay plasticokunapiqa juchˈuy tubukunan kan, llikˈikuqtinqa chay tubukunamantan iskay clase gomakuna yawar jina lloqsimun, chaykuna mezclakuspataq llikˈikusqanta taparapun."
"As the gel solidifies, it forms a tough substance that restores the material’s original strength." "Gomaq chˈakipusqanman jinan plasticoqa mana llikˈiyoq kapun."
"One researcher admits that this synthetic healing process currently under development is “reminiscent ” of what already exists in nature." "Jujnin investigaq runan willan plasticopi chhaynata ruwasqankuqa cuerpopi heridaq thanipusqanman parecekusqanta, ichaqa chaytaqa mejorashankuraqsi."
"What do you think?" "¿Ima ninkin chaymanta?"
"Did the body’s ability to repair wounds come about by evolution? Or was it designed?" "¿Evolución kaqtinchu cuerpopi herida thanin, icha ­ kamasqa kasqanraykuchu?"

"The Bible was completed about two thousand years ago. Since then, countless other books have come and gone." "Bibliaqa 2.000 wata ñaupaqta jinan qelqayta tukukuran, chay qhepakunamanqa askha librokunaraqmi qelqakuran, ichaqa manan mayqenpas igualanchu."
"But not the Bible." "Kaykunapi piensay."
"The Bible has survived many vicious attacks by powerful people." "Bibliataqa autoridadniyoq runakunan chinkachiyta munaranku."
"For example, during the Middle Ages in certain “Christian ” lands,“ the possession and reading of the Bible in the vernacular [the language of the common people] was increasingly associated with heresy and dissent, ” says the book An Introduction to the Medieval Bible." "Ejemplopaq, 1500 wata ñaupaqkunapiqa cristianokunaq kasqan wakin nacionkunapin “rimasqanku simipi Biblia leeqkunata cristiano religionpa contranpi kanankupaq piensaqku ” (El mundo de la renovación católica, 1540 - 1770)."
"Scholars who translated the Bible into the vernacular or who promoted Bible study risked their lives." "Askha runakunan wañuchisqa karanku Bibliata juj simikunaman traducisqankurayku otaq Bibliata leenankupaq jujkunata animasqankuraykupas."
"Some were killed." "Chaywanpas manan mayqen libropas Biblia jinaqa askhanpi ruwakunchu."
"Despite its many enemies, the Bible became ​ — and continues to be — ​ the most widely distributed book of all time." "Bibliataqa wakillanta otaq llapantan traduciranku 2.800 más simikunaman, ruwakurantaqmi 5.000 millones más Bibliakunata."
"In whole or in part, an estimated five billion copies have been printed in more than 2,800 languages." "Filosofiamanta, cienciamanta rimaq librokunatan ichaqa pisillata ruwanku, watakunaq pasasqanman jinataqmi manaña servipunñachu."
"This is in sharp contrast with books on philosophy, science, and related fields, which may have a limited circulation and may quickly go out - of - date." "Bibliata juj simikunaman traducikusqanqa wakin chay simikunatan yanaparan mana chinkananpaq, aswan allinta rimakunanpaqpas."
"The Bible has helped to preserve and shape some of the languages into which it has been translated." "Alemán simiman Bibliata Martín Luteroq traducisqanqa chay simiq allinninpaqmi karan."
"The German translation by Martin Luther had a big influence on that language." "King James Version nisqa ñaupaq kaq Bibliapas inglés simitan yanaparan, “chhaynataqa manan mayqen libropas yanaparanchu ”."
"The first edition of the King James Version has been described as “probably the single most influential book ever published ” in English." "Español simitapas allintan yanaparan, jinallataq Latinoamericapi pisi runaq rimasqan simikunatapas."
"The Bible has “profoundly affected Western culture, influencing not just religious belief and practice, but also art, literature, law, politics, and other fields too numerous to mention. ” ​ — The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Books of the Bible." "“Bibliapi yachachikuykunaqa occidente ladopi runakunaq imayna kausasqantapas cambiaranmi. Dibujokunapas, librokuna qelqasqankupas, imayna rimasqankupas, jujkunapipas, Bibliamanta orqosqan kashan ” (Gran Enciclopedia Universal)."
"Those are just some of the facts that set the Bible apart." "Biblia jinaqa manan ima libropas kanchu."
"Why, though, is it so popular?" "¿Imaraykun jujniray?"
"Why have people risked their lives for it?" "¿Imaraykun Bibliarayku wañuytaraq tariranku?"
"The many reasons include the following: The Bible contains moral and spiritual teachings that reflect exceptional wisdom." "Ñaupaqta, yachachiwanchismi imayna kausayta, Diosta imayna serviytapas, chaypin rikukun ancha yachaywan qelqasqa kasqanta."
"The Bible helps us to understand the root cause of human suffering and conflict." "Iskaypi, willawanchismi imarayku guerrakuna sufrimientopas kasqanta."
"Better still, it promises an end to those problems, even revealing how that will come about." "Kinsapi, willanmi problemakuna chinkapunanmanta imaynata chinkapunantapas, chayta yachaymi suyakuyta qowanchis."
"The Bible is made up of 66 books; this sacred volume was completed over a period of approximately 1,600 years." "Bibliapiqa 66 librokunan kan, qelqakusqan tiempoqa 1.600 watakunatan duraran."
"The Bible was written by about 40 human secretaries or scribes, some of whom were also farmers, fishermen, judges, kings, and musicians." "Qelqaqkunaqa 40 runakuna jinan karanku."
"The Bible’s main theme is the Kingdom of God, a heavenly government that will rule the earth." "Wakinmi karanku chajra llank’aqkuna, challwaqkuna, juezkuna, reykuna, musicata tocaqkuna."
"The Kingdom will eliminate evil, suffering, and death by uniting mankind under our rightful Sovereign ​ — the Creator, Jehovah God. ​ — 1 Corinthians 15: 24 - 26." "Chay gobiernon tukuchinqa millay kausayta, sufrimientota, wañuytapas; llapa runan Jehová Diospa gobiernasqallan kapunqa, payllan derechoyoq kamachiwananchispaqqa."
"Secular education is important." "Educacionniyoq kayqa allinmi."
"But “education... that produces initials at the end of your name... is no guarantee of moral intelligence, ” said an editorial in Canada’s newspaper Ottawa Citizen." "Ichaqa manan asegurawanchischu allin kausayniyoq kayta, chaytan nin Canadá nacionmanta Ottawa Citizen periódico."
"Indeed, many highly educated people ​ — including leaders in business and government — ​ cheat, defraud, and steal, resulting in “a serious crisis of confidence, ” according to a global study published by Edelman, a public relations firm." "Ejemplopaq, runakunaqa profesionniyoqña kanku, empresakunapi allin cargoyoqña kanku chaypas suwakunkun, engañanku iman. Chaykuna kasqanraykun “runakunaqa manaña jujkunapi confiayta munankuñachu ”, chaytan nin agencia Edelman."
"The Bible focuses on moral and spiritual education." "Bibliaqa yachachiwanchismi imayna kausayta, Diosta imayna serviytapas."
"It gives us insight into “what is righteous and just and fair, the entire course of what is good. ”" "Jinaspapas yanapawanchismi ‘ allinta kausananchispaq ’, ‘ imachus chaninkaqta ’ allin kaqkunata ruwaytapas (Proverbios 2: 9)."
"To illustrate, a 23 - year - old man, whom we will call Stephen, was in prison in Poland." "Chaytan yacharan Stephen, payqa 23 watanpin kashan."
"While confined, he began to study the Bible and to appreciate its practical advice." "Polonia nacionpi preso kashaspan Bibliata estudiaran, chayman jina kausay allinninpaq kasqantataq repararan."
"“I now see what it means to ‘ honor your father and your mother, ’ ” he wrote." "Chaymi niran: “Chayraqmi entiendeni ‘ taytaykitapas mamaykitapas respetankin ’ nispa Bibliaq nisqanta."
"“I have also learned to control my emotions, especially excessive anger. ” ​ — Ephesians 4: 31; 6: 2." "Chaymatapas manañan k’araq sonqochu kani, kunanqa yachanin genioy controlayta ”, nispa."
"A principle that Stephen took to heart is the one found at Proverbs 19: 11: “The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger, and it is beauty on his part to overlook an offense. ”" "Proverbios 19: 11 texton nin: “Runaq allin yuyayniyoq - kayninqa phiñakuytan jark’an ”, nispa, chay textoq nisqanmi Stephenpa sonqonman chayaran."
"Now, when Stephen is confronted with a challenging situation, he tries to analyze it calmly and to apply the relevant Bible principles." "Kunanqa pipas phiñachiqtinqa kallpachakunmi chay textoq nisqanta kasukunanpaq."
"“I have found that the Bible is the best guidebook, ” he said." "Ninmi: “Biblian yachachiwan imayna kausayta ”, nispa."
"Maria, who is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, was publicly insulted by a prejudiced woman, who caused quite a commotion." "Mariaqa Jehová Diospa testigonmi, juj kutinmi paytaqa Testigokunata cheqnikuq warmi insultaran, ch’aqwatan jatarichiran."
"But instead of retaliating, Maria calmly continued on her way." "Marian ichaqa mana ima nispalla ripuran."
"The other woman then felt bad about her behavior and sought out the Witnesses." "Chay warmiqa chhayna ruwasqanmantan p’enqakuran, jinan Jehová Diospa testigonkunata maskharan."
"About a month later, when she finally saw Maria again, she hugged Maria and apologized to her." "Juj killa qhepamanmi Mariawan tuparan, jinan disculpakuran."
"Moreover, she correctly discerned that Maria’s mildness and self - control reflected her religious beliefs. The result?" "Payqa cuentatan qokuran Mariaqa religionninpi yachasqanrayku chhayna sumaq sonqo kasqanta."
"The once prejudiced woman and five members of her family decided to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses." "Chay qhepamanqa Mariapas familianpas Bibliatan estudiaranku, llapankuqa soqtan karanku."
"Wisdom is vindicated by its results, said Jesus Christ." "Jesusmi niran yachayqa ruwaypi rikukusqanta."
"Bible principles, therefore, stand vindicated!" "Bibliapi consejokunaqa manan yanqa consejokunachu, chaytaqa runakunata imayna yanapasqanpin sut’ita reparakun."
"They bring out the best in us." "Allin runa kasqanchistan sut’iman orqon."
"They ‘ make the inexperienced wise, ’ they ‘ cause the heart to rejoice, ’ and they ‘ make the eyes shine ’ with moral and spiritual clarity. ​ — Psalm 19: 7, 8." "“Mana yachaqtan yachayniyoqman tukuchin ”,“ sonqotan kusichin ”, “ñawitan kicharin ” imaynata kausanapaqpas imaynata Diosta servinapaqpas (Salmo 19: 7, 8)."
"When studying a disease epidemic, investigators try to find the cause ​ — what triggered the outbreak." "Ima onqoymantapas yachanankupaqqa investigaqkunaqa averiguankun imaynata qallarisqanta."
"The same principle applies to understanding the “plague ” of human suffering and discord." "Chay jinatan Bibliapas willawanchis imarayku guerrakunapas sufrimientopas kasqanmanta."
"Again, the Bible is of immense help, for it documents our earliest history, the time when our troubles started." "Willawanchismi runakuna imaynapi qallarisqanta, problemakuna imaynapi qallarisqantapas."
"The book of Genesis reveals that mankind’s woes began when the first humans rebelled against God." "Sufrimientoqa qallariran Adanwan Evawan Dios contra Edén huertapi jatarisqankumantapachan, chaytan Génesis libro willawanchis."
"Among other things, they took it upon themselves to set moral standards ​ — a right that belonged only to our Creator." "Runakunaqa paykuna kikinkumantan decidiyta munaranku imachus allin imataqchus mana allin kasqanta, ichaqa chayta yachayqa Diospa derechollanmi (Génesis 3: 1 - 7)."
"Sadly, since then, people in general have adopted the same independent thinking." "Chaymantapachan askha runakuna chay jinallatataq ruwanku."
"The results? Human history is a chronicle, not of freedom and happiness, but of conflict, oppression, and moral and spiritual discord." "Chayraykun kan guerrakuna, runamasinkuta sufrichiykuna, mana allin kausaykuna, religionkunapas mana allinkunatan ruwanku, manataqmi kanchu kusikuy (Eclesiastés 8: 9)."
"The Bible rightly states: “It does not belong to man... to direct his step. ”" "Chayraykuchá Bibliaqa nin: “Manan runaq munayninchu imayna kananpaqpas ”, nispa (Jeremías 10: 23)."
"The good news is that mankind’s disastrous experiment with moral independence is almost over." "Ichaqa tukuy chay mana allinkunaqa chinkapunqañan, chayqa ancha sumaq willakuymi."
"The Bible assures us that God, out of love for those who respect his authority and standards, will not forever tolerate badness and the suffering it causes." "Diosqa autoridadninta respetaqkunata munakusqanraykun manapuni jinallatachu qhawanqa millay kausayta sufrimientotapas."
"The wicked “will bear the consequences of their way. ”" "Millay runakunaqa ‘ mana allin ruwasqankuq ruruntan cosechanqaku ’ (Proverbios 1: 30, 31)."
"“The meek, ” on the other hand,“ will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace. ” ​ — Psalm 37: 11." "“Llamp’u sonqokunan ichaqa kay allpata chaskinqaku, sumaq thaj - nisqataq tiyakunqaku ” (Salmo 37: 11)."
"“[God’s] will is that all sorts of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth. ” ​ — 1 Timothy 2: 3, 4" "“[Diosqa] munanmi llapan runakuna qespichisqa kanankuta, cheqaq - kayta reqsinankutapas ”"
"God will fulfill his purpose for a peaceful earth by means of “the Kingdom of God. ”" "Diosmi gobiernonwan mundontinta tukuchinqa sumaq thaj - pachaman."
"That Kingdom is a world government, and through it God will express his rightful sovereignty over mankind." "Chay gobiernollan pachantinta kamachinqa."
"Jesus linked the Kingdom with the earth, saying in his model prayer: “Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take place... on earth. ” ​ — Matthew 6: 10." "Jesús Diospa gobiernonmanta rimaspaqa kay pachapi kamachikunanmantan rimasharan chaymi niran: “Qhapaqsuyuyki [gobiernoyki] jamuchun, munayniyki kay pachapi ruwakuchun ”, nispa."
"Yes, the subjects of God’s Kingdom will do God’s will, recognizing the Creator ​ — not any fellow human — ​ as rightful Ruler." "Diospa gobiernonpi kaqkunaqa Diospa kamachikuyninkunatan kasukunqaku, rikuchinqakutaqmi paylla atiyniyoq kamachikunanpaq kasqanta manataq runakunachu."
"Corruption, greed, economic disparities, racial prejudice, and war will cease." "Manañan kanqachu guerrakuna, suwakuykuna, munapayaykuna, cheqnikuykuna, jujkunapas."
"There will literally be one world, one government, and one set of moral and spiritual standards. ​ — Revelation 11: 15." "Juj gobiernollan llapa runakunata kamachinqa, imayna kausanamanta Diosta imaynata servinamantapas kaq kamachikuyllan kanqa."
"The key to seeing that new world is education." "Diospa gobiernasqan pachapi kausanapaqqa Bibliamantan yachananchis."
"“[God’s] will is that all sorts of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth, ” says 1 Timothy 2: 3, 4." "Biblian nin: “[Diosqa] munanmi llapan runakuna qespichisqa kanankuta, cheqaq - kayta reqsinankutapas ”, nispa."
"That truth includes Bible teachings about what we might call the Kingdom’s constitution ​ — the laws and principles by which it will rule, examples of which can be found in Jesus Christ’s Sermon on the Mount." "Chay cheqaq kaymi chay gobiernoq kamachikuyninkunapas. Wakin kamachikuykunan tarikun Mateo 5 - 7 capitulokunapi."
"When you read those three chapters, try to imagine what life will be like when everyone applies Jesus ’ wisdom." "Chay kinsantin capitulokunata leespa imaginakuy, ¿imaynan paraisopi kausay kanqa chay kamachikuykunata llapallanku kasukuqtinku?"
"Should we be surprised that the Bible is the world’s most widely distributed book?" "Chhaynaqa, ¿juj allin librollachu Biblia?"
"Absolutely not!" Manan.
"Its teachings have the hallmark of divine inspiration." "Sut’itan reparakun Bibliaqa Diospa qelqachisqan kasqanta."
"And its wide circulation reflects God’s desire that people of all languages and nations learn about him and benefit from the blessings his Kingdom will bring. ​ — Acts 10: 34, 35." "Diosqa munanmi tukuy clase runakuna paymanta yachanankuta, gobiernonpi kusisqa kausanankutapas, chaychá Bibliaqa juj librokunamantapas aswan askhanpi rakikun."
"The Bible says that laws govern the heavens" "Bibliaqa willanmi ch’askakunapaqpas kay pachapaqpas leykuna kasqanta"
"Ancient peoples “envisioned a universe subject to whims of gods, ” says the Encyclopedia of Science and Religion. The Bible, however, says that the universe is governed by physical laws." "Ñaupa tiempopiqa runakunaqa creeqkun “universopi tukuy ima kaqpas dioskunaq controlasqan kananpaq ” (Encyclopedia of Science and Religion)."
"For example, about 3,500 years ago, the Bible referred to “the laws governing the heavens [and] the earth. ”" "Ichaqa 3.500 wata ñaupaqtaraqmi Bibliaqa willaranña ch’askakunapaqpas kay pachapaqpas leykuna kasqanta (Job 38: 33)."

"A most endearing quality of Bible writers is their honesty ​ — even in regard to their own failings." "Bibliata qelqaqkunaqa kikinkuq juchankumantapas sut’illantan qelqaranku, chayraykun Bibliaqa aswan valorniyoq."
"For example, after King David committed adultery with a woman named Bath - sheba, he frankly acknowledged: “What is bad in your [God’s] eyes I have done. ”" "Ejemplopaq, rey Davidqa Bat - seba warmiwanmi wasanchay juchaman urmaran, chay qhepamanmi niran: “Qan contrapunin millakusqaykita ruwani ”, nispa (Salmo 51: 4)."

"Do not do that!... Worship God! ”" "Diostan yupaychanaykiqa ”, nispa."
"Such candor, sadly lacking in ancient scribes, is typical of Bible writers." "Bibliata qelqaqkunaqa sut’illantan willakuranku, chay tiempopi juj librokunata qelqaqkunan ichaqa mana chhaynachu karanku."
"The Bible encourages us to cultivate qualities that foster good mental health, qualities such as compassion and forgiveness." "Bibliaqa yanapawanchismi khuyapayakuq kanapaq, chhayna kaspaqa thajmi sientekunchis."
"“Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another, ” says Ephesians 4: 32." "Niwanchismi: “Aswanpas sumaq sonqo kaychis, khuyapayanakuq, pampachaykunakuq ”, nispa."

"Forgiveness, the article explains, can result in “healthier relationships; greater spiritual and psychological well - being; less anxiety, stress, and hostility; lower blood pressure; fewer symptoms of depression; and lower risk of alcohol and substance abuse. ”" "Nillarantaqmi: “[Perdonaqkunaqa] aswan allintan jujkunawan kausanku, thajmi sientekunku, Diostapas kusisqan servinku; menostan llakikunku renegankupas; sonqonkupas manan t’impunchu, manan faciltachu urmanku trago ujayman drogakuymanpas ”, nispa."

"CIENCIAQA matematicawanmi explican universo imayna controlasqa kasqanta; ichaqa manan explicayta atinchu imarayku universo paqarisqanta, imarayku k’apaj controlasqa kasqantapas."
"SCIENCE CAN explain how the reproductive organs function, but it cannot define sexual morality." "CIENCIAQA explicanmi warmi - qhari puñuymanta, ichaqa manan willanchu pantay ñanpi ama purinata."

"The Bible addresses these and many other important questions, thus helping us to “understand what is righteous and just and fair, the entire course of what is good. ” ​ — Proverbs 2: 9."

"PROFESSOR Yan - Der Hsuuw is the director of embryo research at Taiwan’s National Pingtung University of Science and Technology." "YAN - DER HSUUW doctormi estudian embriología nisqata, chayqa wawakuna imayna formakusqanmi."
"He once believed in evolution, but after becoming a research scientist, he changed his mind." "Payqa Universidad Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología de Pingtung (Taiwán) nisqapi directormi."
"He explained his reasons to Awake!" "Evolucionpin creeran kunantaq manaña. ¡Rijch’ariy!"
"Please tell us a little about your background." "Vidaykimanta willariwayku."
"I was born in 1966 and grew up in Taiwan." "1966 watapin nacerani, Taiwán nacionpitaq wiñarani."
"My parents ’ religion was based on both Taoism and Buddhism." "Tayta - mamayqa taoísmo, budismo religionkunamantan karanku."
"Although we worshipped our ancestors and prayed to images, we never entertained the concept of a personal Creator." "Wañupuqkunata imagenkunata iman adoraq kayku, ichaqa manan jayk’aqpas kamaq Diospiqa piensaraykuchu."
"Why did you study biology?" "¿Imaraykun biología estudiayta decidikuranki?"

"The university professors taught evolution, claiming that evidence supports it." "Profesorniykun niwaqku: “Askha pruebakunan kan evolucionpi creenapaqqa ”, nispa."
"I believed them." "Chaymi noqapas creerani."
"Why did you start reading the Bible?" "¿Imaraykun Biblia leeyta qallariranki?"
"My motive was twofold. First, I reasoned that of the many gods that people worship, one must be greater than the others." "Juj razonmi kay, noqaqa piensaqmi kani: “Runakunaq adorasqanku dioskunamantaqa kanpunichá juj aswan atiyniyoq Dios ”, nispa."
"But which one? Second, I knew that the Bible is a highly respected book. So I joined Bible study classes." "Iskay razontaq, yacharanin Bibliaqa juj allin libro kasqanta, chaymi Bibliata yachanaypaq cursoman matriculakurani."
"When I started studying at Belgium’s Catholic University of Leuven in 1992, I visited a Catholic church and asked the priest to help me understand the Bible, but he declined my request." "1992 watapin Universidad Catolicapi (Bélgica) estudiayta qallarirani. Chaypin católico iglesiaman rirani, jinaspa sacerdoteta nirani Bibliamanta yachachiwananpaq, ichaqa manan munaranchu."
"So how was your spiritual hunger satisfied?" "¿Imaynapitaq Diosmantari yacharanki?"
"Two years later, while I was still in Belgium doing scientific research, I met a Polish lady named Ruth, who was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses." "Iskay wata qhepamanmi universidadpi estudiashaspa Polonia nacionmanta Ruth sutiyoq señorata reqsirani."
"She had learned Chinese in order to help university students who wanted to learn about God." "Payqa Jehová Diospa testigonmi kasqa, chino simitataq yachasqa universidadpi estudiantekunata Bibliamanta yachachinanpaq."
"I had prayed for such help, so I was delighted to meet her." "Noqaqa chaytapunin Diosmanta mañakurani, chaymi kusikurani payta reqsispa."
"Ruth showed me that the Bible, while not a science book, is in harmony with science." "Ruthmi explicawaran Bibliaqa manaña cienciamantachu riman chaypas, cienciaq tukuy tarisqanwan tupasqanta."
"For example, the Bible writer David said in prayer to God: “Your eyes even saw me as an embryo; all its parts were written in your book regarding the days when they were formed, before any of them existed. ”" "Ejemplopaq rey Davidmi Diosmanta orakuran: “Wijsallapiraq kashaqtiymi rikuwarankiña, libroykipin qelqasqaña kasharan cuerpoypa partenkuna imayna kananpas, manaraq jujllapas kashaqtin ”, nispa (Salmo 139: 16, Traducción del Nuevo Mundo)."
"Although David was using poetic language, in principle, he was right!" "Bibliaqa cheqaqllatan rimashan."
"Even before body parts form, the instructions for their development are all there." "Cuerpoq partenkuna manaraq formakushaqtinmi imayna kananpas qelqasqaña kashan."
"The accuracy of the Bible helped convince me that it is God’s Word." "Chayta sut’illanta nisqanwanmi convencekurani Bibliaqa Diospa Palabran kasqanmanta."
"I also began to appreciate that there is only one true God, Jehovah." "Jinaspapas yacharanin ch’ullalla cheqaq Dios kasqanmanta, sutintaq Jehová kasqanmanta."
"What convinced you that God created life?" "¿Iman convencerasunki kausayta Dios kamasqanmanta?"
"A goal of scientific research is to find the truth, not to support preconceived ideas." "Cienciaqa allintan imatapas investigan."
"My study of embryo development led me to change my view ​ — that is, I concluded that life was created." "Wijsapi wawa imaynata formakusqanmi piensasqayta cambiachiwaran, chaymi creerani kausayqa kamasqa kasqanta."
"To illustrate, engineers design assembly lines so that the right parts are fitted together in the right order and in the right way." "Ejemplopaq ingenierokunaqa juj maquinata armanankupaqqa piezakunatan ordenpi churananku, chhaynapi funcionananpaq."
"Embryo development is somewhat similar but vastly more complex." "Chayman rijch’akuqmi wijsapi wawaq formakusqanpas, chayqa admirakunapaqmi."
"The process all starts with a single fertilized cell, doesn’t it?" "¿Imaynatan wawa formakun?"
"Yes. That microscopic cell then divides, starting the process of cell division." "Warmi onqoq rijuriqtinqa, juch’uy celulan wijsanpi paqarin."
"For a time, the number of cells doubles every 12 to 24 hours." "Chay celulan askhaman t’aqakun, qallariypin sapa 12 horamanta, 24 horamanta ima dobletaraq yapakun."
"Early in this process, cells called stem cells form." "Chay tiempopin células madre nisqakuna askha celulakunata paqarichinku, chhaynapi wawa formakuspa wiñananpaq."
"Stem cells can produce almost any of the 200 or so different cell types needed for a fully formed baby, such as blood cells, bone cells, nerve cells, and so on." "Chay celulakunan fabricanku yawarta, tullukunata, umapi neuronakunata, jujkunatapas."
"My study of embryo development led me to conclude that life was created" "Investigasqaymi convencewaran kausayqa Diospa kamasqan kasqanta"
"The right cells must be produced in the right order and at the right places." "Celulakunaqa necesitakusqanman jinallan paqarin ima ordenpi may kanallanpitaqmi."
"First they assemble into tissues that will in turn assemble themselves into organs and limbs." "Ñaupaqtaqa aychatan paqarichinku, chaymantataq organokunata, chay qhepamantaq makita, chakita jujkunatawan."
"What engineer even dreams of writing instructions for such a process?" "Wawa imaynata formakusqanpas jayk’a tiempopi wiñananpas ñaupaqtaraqmi ADN nisqapi qelqasqaña kashan."
"Yet, the instructions for embryo development are superbly written in DNA." "Manan mayqen ingenieropas chhayna planotaqa ruwayta atinmanchu."
"When I consider the beauty of it all, I’m convinced that life was designed by God." "Chaykuna imayna ruwasqa kasqanpi piensaspan admirakuni, manataq iskayanichu kausayqa Diospa paqarichisqan kasqanmanta."
"Why did you become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?" "¿Imaraykun Jehová Diospa testigon kapuranki?"
"In a word, love. Jesus Christ said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among yourselves. ”" "Jehová Diospa testigonkuna ukhupi munakuyta rikusqayrayku."
"That love is impartial. It is not influenced by a person’s nationality, culture, or skin color." "Jesucriston niran: “Chhaynapin noqaq yachachisqaykuna kasqaykichista llapa yachanqaku qankuna munanakuqtiykichis ”, nispa."
"I both observed and experienced that kind of love when I began to associate with the Witnesses." "Chay munakuy kaqtinqa manan qhawanakunchischu juj nacionmanta kaqkunawan juj razamanta kaqkunawanpas."

"Because of his Christian conscience, Professor Yan - Der Hsuuw does not work with human embryonic stem cells." "Conciencianta respetasqanraykun Yan - Der Hsuuw doctorqa runapi células madre nisqawan mana llank’anchu."
"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMATAN BIBLIA YACHACHIN?"
"Anxiety has two faces. One is a liability; the other, an asset." "Llakipakuyqa mayninpin allin kanman mayninpitaq mana."
"The Bible helps us to recognize both kinds." "Biblian yanapawanchis chayta yachanapaq."
"Anxiety involves feelings of uneasiness, nervousness, or worry." "Llakipakuypi tarikuspaqa preocupasqan manchasqan sientekunku."
"Because we live in an uncertain world, bouts of anxiety can overtake any of us." "Mayninpiqa llapanchismi chhaynapi tarikusunman sasa tiempopi kausasqanchisrayku."
"King David wrote: “How long will I have anxious concern, with grief in my heart each day? ”" "Rey Davidmi qelqaran: “Jayk’aqkamataq yuyayniypi musphasaq, sonqoypipas p’unchay - p’unchay llakipakusaq ”, nispa (Salmo 13: 2)."
"What helped David to cope?" "¿Imaynatan atiparan?"
"He poured out his heart to God in prayer, trusting fully in God’s loyal love. In fact, God invites us to unburden ourselves to him." "Oracionpi tukuy llakikuyninta Diosman willaspan, yacharanmi Diosqa payta munakusqanta (Salmo 13: 5; 62: 8)."
"“Throw all your anxiety on [God], because he cares for you, ” says 1 Peter 5: 7." "Diosqa invitawanchismi payman llakikuyninchista willananchispaq, payqa anchatan noqanchispi interesakun."
"Doing something for loved ones can allay our anxiety about them" "Jujkunapaq imallatapas ruwaymi pisiyachinman paykunamanta llakikuyninchista"
"Often, though, we can allay anxieties by addressing them in a practical way." "Mayninpiqa llakipakuyninchisqa allinmi kanman, ¿imaynapi?"
"For example, when the Bible writer Paul felt “anxiety for all the congregations, ” he worked hard to comfort and encourage those for whom he was concerned." "Apóstol Pablotaqa iñiq t’aqakunamanta ‘ sapa p’unchay yuyariqtinmi llaki ñit’iykuq ’, chaymi tukuy atisqanta ruwaq iñiqmasinkunata kallpachananpaq."
"In that respect, his anxiety proved to be an asset, for it moved him to extend needed help." "Chay kutipiqa allinmi karan llakipakusqan jujkunata yanapananpaq."

"PORTRAITS FROM THE PAST" "ÑAUPA TIEMPOTA QHAWARISPA"
"IGNAZ SEMMELWEIS may not be a household name, yet his work has benefited most modern families." "Semmelweis runaqa mana jayk’aq rikusqantan chay hospitalpi rikuran."
"Born in Buda (now Budapest), Hungary, he received his medical degree at the University of Vienna in 1844." "Imaymanataña ruwaranku chay onqoyta chinkachinankupaq chaypas manan atirankuchu."
"On taking up his post as assistant to a professor at the First Maternity Clinic of Vienna’s General Hospital in 1846, Semmelweis faced an appalling reality ​ — more than 13 percent of the women giving birth there died from a disease called childbed fever." "Semmelweis runaqa sinchitan llakikuran warmikuna ñak’arispa pisi - pisimanta wañukapusqankuta rikuspa."
"Various theories as to the cause of this disease had been proposed, yet no one had solved the mystery." "Chaymi yachayta munaran imaynapi chay onqoy rijurisqanta imaynata chinkachiytapas."
"All attempts to reduce the mortality rate proved futile." "Llank’asqan hospitalpin karan iskay clinicakuna, chaypin warmikuna onqokuqku."
"Troubled by the spectacle of numerous mothers suffering a slow, agonizing death, Semmelweis determined to find the cause of the disease and prevent it." "Jujninpin askha warmikuna wañuqku jujninpitaq pisilla."
"The hospital in which Semmelweis worked had two separate maternity clinics, and curiously, the maternal death rate was much higher in the first clinic than it was in the second." "Ñaupaq kaqpin medicinata estudiaqkuna llank’aqku, qhepa kaqpitaq partera kanankupaq estudiaqkuna."
"The only difference between the two clinics was that medical students were taught in the first and midwives in the second." "¿Imaraykun medicinata estudiaqkunaq llank’asqan clinicapi aswan askha warmikuna wañuranku?"
"Why, then, such a difference in death rates?" "Chaytan Semmelweis runa yachayta munaran."
"Probing that question, Semmelweis systematically eliminated possible causes of the disease, but the culprit remained elusive." "Chaymi chay onqoy imaynapi paqarisqanta yachananpaq investigayta qallariran."
"In early 1847, Semmelweis was presented with a crucial clue." "1847 watapi jinan llank’aqmasin amigon Jakob Kolletschka autopsiata ruwashaspa makinta kuchurukuran, infección jaykuruqtintaq wañupuran."
"His colleague and friend Jakob Kolletschka had died from blood poisoning after sustaining a wound while performing a postmortem examination." "Amigonta autopsia ruwasqanku documentota leespan Semmelweis yacharuran fiebre puerperal nisqa onqoywan jina wañupusqanta."
"Hence, Semmelweis thought that perhaps what he termed “poisons ” from cadavers were infecting pregnant patients, thus causing childbed fever." "Chaypin repararuran wañupuqkunaq cuerponpi juj “veneno ” jina kasqanta, chaywan warmikuna contagiakusqankuta."
"Doctors and medical students, who frequently did autopsies before going to the maternity ward, had unwittingly been transmitting the disease to expectant mothers during obstetric examinations or childbirth!" "Doctorkunapas estudiantekunapas wañusqa runakunata autopsiata ruwasqanku qhepamanmi onqoq warmikunata atiendeqku, paykunan mana reparakuspa chay onqoyta apaykuranku."
"Mortality in the second ward was lower because students of midwifery did not perform autopsies." "Qhepa kaq clinicapi llank’aq parterakunaqa manan autopsiata ruwaqkuchu, chaymi paykunaq llank’asqanku clinicapi onqokuq warmikuna pisilla wañuranku."
"Semmelweis immediately introduced a strict policy of handwashing, which included sterilizing the hands in a solution of chlorinated lime before initiating examinations of pregnant women." "Chayta yacharuspan kaqpacha llapa llank’aqkunata niran onqoq warmikunata manaraq atiendeshaspa tukuy ima jap’isqankuta limpiota maqchinankupaq, makinkutapas cloruro de calcio nisqawan maqchikunankupaq."
"The results were dramatic: mortality rates plummeted from 18.27 percent in April to 0.19 percent by the end of the year." "Chhaynata ruwasqanku qhepamanmi pisiyapuran wañupuqkuna, abril killakamaqa sapa 100 warmikunamantan 18 wañupuranku, wata tukuypaqtaq iskay kinsalla wañupuranku."
"“My doctrines exist to rid maternity hospitals of their horror, to preserve the wife for her husband and the mother for her child. ” ​ — Ignaz Semmelweis" "“Maytan munani hospitalpi onqokuq warmikuna mana wañunankuta, chhaynapi qosakuna esposankuwan kanankupaq, wawakunapas mamankuwan kanankupaq ” (Ignác Semmelweis)"
"Not all welcomed Semmelweis ’ success." "Ichaqa manan llapa llank’aqmasinkunachu kusikuranku chay ruwasqanmanta."
"The results he obtained challenged the theories concerning childbed fever held by his superior, who also found Semmelweis ’ insistent manner irritating." "Astawanqa jefenmi phiñakuran, payqa niranmi: ‘ Manan chayraykuqa kanmanchu ’, nispa."
"Semmelweis eventually lost his post in Vienna and returned to Hungary." "Chaymi hospitalmanta despedipuqtinku Hungría nacionman kutipuran."
"There he took charge of the obstetrics department at the St." "Chaypin Departamento de Obstetricia del Hospital San Roque, Pest nisqa llaqtapi llank’ayta qallariran."
"Rochus Hospital in Pest, where his methods brought down the mortality rate for childbed fever to under 1 percent." "Chay hospitalpipas ñaupaqpi ruwasqanta jinan ruwaran, chaymi iskay kinsallaña wañuranku fiebre puerperal nisqawan."
"In 1861, Semmelweis published his life’s work, The Cause, Concept, and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever." "Semmelweis runaqa askha watakunan investigaran chay onqoymanta yachananpaq, chay investigasqantan 1861 watapi Etiología, concepto y profilaxis de la fiebre puerperal nisqa libronpi orqomuran."
"Unfortunately, the importance of his findings was not recognized until some years later." "Ichaqa unay watakuna qhepamanñan chay libronpi qelqamusqanta allinpaq qhawariranku."
"In the meantime, countless lives that could have been saved were tragically lost." "Chaykamaqa waranqa - waranqanpi runakunan wañuranku."
"Semmelweis enforced hygienic measures at medical facilities under his supervision. ​ — Painting by Robert Thom" "Semmelweis runan kamachiran tukuy imatapas limpiota jap’inankupaq (Robert Tom pintasqan cuadro)"
"Semmelweis was eventually recognized as one of the fathers of the modern antiseptic technique." "Unay wata qhepamanñan Semmelweis runaq tukuy investigasqanta reconoceranku."
"His work helped to establish that microscopic matter can cause disease." "Chay investigasqanmi juj medicokunata yanaparan mana rikukuq kurukuna onqoyta paqarichimusqanta yachanankupaq."
"He is part of the history of the germ theory of disease, which has been called “the single most important contribution to medical science and practice. ”" "Chaymi astawanqa medicokunata yanaparan imayna jampinankupaq."
"Interestingly, over 3,000 years earlier, the Mosaic Law, which was later included in the Bible, had already provided sound guidance on the proper handling of corpses." "Ichaqa kinsa waranqa wata ñaupaqtaraqmi Biblia willaranña wañuqpa ayanta jap’ispaqa ima ruwanankuta."
"In 19th - century Europe, many women died of childbed fever, a scourge with mortality rates of up to 30 percent." "1800 watakunapin Europa ladopi sapa 100 warmikunamanta 30 warmikuna wañuranku fiebre puerperal nisqawan."
"Microbes had been observed under a microscope as early as 1674, but their dangers had not been fully understood." "1674 watapin microscopio nisqa aparatoq yanapayninwan yachakuran mana rikukuq kurukuna kasqanta."
"It was common practice for doctors to deliver babies right after performing autopsies, without first sterilizing their hands." "Ichaqa manan sut’itapuniqa yacharankuchu chay kurukuna onqoykuna apamusqanta. Chay tiempopiqa autopsia ruwasqanku qhepamanmi makinkuta mana maqchikuspa onqoq warmikunata atiendeqku."
"Semmelweis introduced handwashing into medical practice, thus saving countless lives." "Semmelweis runan yachachiran onqosqakunata atiendenapaq makitaraq maqchikuna kasqanta."
"According to the Mosaic Law, which dates to the 16th century B.C.E., anyone touching a corpse became unclean for seven days and had to undergo a cleansing procedure that included bathing and washing his garments." "Chaymi askha runakunata wañuymanta salvaran. 1500 watakunapi manaraq Jesús jamushaqtinmi kamachikuy simipi niranña wañuqpa ayanta jap’iqqa qanchis p’unchayta qhelli kananta.

"THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT" "¿IMATAN BIBLIA YACHACHIN?"
"Some people claim to be religious, but they struggle to understand the meaning of “faith. ”" "Askha runakunan ninku: “Iñiyniyoqmi kani ”, nispa, ichaqa manan yachankuchu imachus iñiy kasqanta."
"What is faith, and why is it important?" "¿Imataq iñiyri? ¿Imaraykun iñiyniyoq kay ancha importante?"
"Many people think that a person who has faith simply accepts a belief without having any real evidence." "Askha runakunan jujkunaq willasqallanta uyarikuspa imapipas creenku chaytataq ninku: “Noqapas iñinin ”, nispa."
"For example, consider a religious person who says, “I believe in God. ”" "Religioso runakunan ninku: “Iñinin Diospi ”, nispa."
"If that person is asked, “Why do you believe? ”" "Ichaqa, “¿imaraykun Diospi iñinki? ”"
"he might reply, “That’s the way I was raised ” or,“ That’s what I’ve always been taught. ”" "nispa pipas tapuykuqtinmi ninku: “Tayta - mamaymi chayta yachachiwaranku ” otaq“ chhaynatan yachachiwaranku ”, nispa."
"In such cases, there might seem to be little difference between having faith and being gullible." "Chhaynata uyarillasqankupi creesqankutan ninku: “Iñiy ”, nispa."
"“Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen. ”" "Biblian nin: “Iñiyqa suyashasqanchista cheqaqtapuni chaskinanchispaq yuyaymi, mana rikusqanchistapas kashasqanpaqpuni yuyaymi ”, nispa."
"For a person’s expectation to be assured, he or she needs to have sound reasons for that assurance." "Imapas suyakusqanchis cheqaqpuni kasqanta creenapaqqa pruebakunan kanan, chay pruebakunan garantía jina."
"In fact, the original - language word for the phrase “assured expectation ” means more than an inner feeling or mere wishful thinking." "Griego simipi “cheqaqtapuni ” nisqa simiqa, manan yanqa suyakuyllamantachu rimashan, aswanpas pruebakuna kasqanrayku seguro kasqanchismantan rimashan."
"So faith involves conviction that is based on evidence." "“Kay pacha qallariymantapachan runakunaqa sut’ita yachanku Diosqa wiñay atiyniyoq kasqanta, payqa Diospuni kasqantapas."
"“His [God’s] invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship. ” ​ — Romans 1: 20." "Chaykunataqa manan runakunaqa rikunchu, aswanpas Diosqa kamasqankunapin sut’ita reqsichikun ” Biblian nin: “Pipas mana iñiyniyoq kaspaqa manan Diospa sonqonman chayaqtapuni ruwayta atinmanchu."
"“Without faith it is impossible to please God well, for whoever approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him. ” ​ — Hebrews 11: 6." "Chhaynaqa, pipas Diosman asuykuqqa iñinanpunin Diospa kasqanta, Diosqa maskhaqninkunata saminchaq kasqantapas ”, nispa."
"As mentioned earlier, many people believe in God simply because they have been taught to do so." "Ñaupaqpi yachasqanchis jina, askha runakunan tayta - mamanku otaq jujkunaq willasqallankuta uyarikuspa ninku: “Iñinin Diospi ”, nispa."
"‘ That’s the way I was raised, ’ they might say." "Diosqa manan chaytachu munan."
"But God wants those who worship him to have genuine confidence in his existence and in his love." "Payqa munanmi allinta reqsinanchista, munakuq kasqanta yachananchistapas."
"That is one reason why the Bible emphasizes the need to seek him earnestly, so that we can truly come to know him." "Chaymi Biblia kallpachawanchis Diosta maskhananchispaq allinta reqsinanchispaqwan."
"“Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you. ” ​ — James 4: 8." "“Diosman asuykuychis, jinan payqa asuykamusunkichis ”"
"“Faith follows the thing heard, ” says the Bible." "Biblian nin: “Iñiyqa uyariywanmi jamun ”, nispa."
"So the first step toward building faith in God is to ‘ hear ’ what the Bible really teaches about him." "Arí, Diospi iñinapaqqa Bibliapi paymanta willawasqanchistan ‘ uyarinanchis ’. ¿Imaynatan chayta ruwasunman?"
"Studying the Bible will help you to find solid answers to important questions, including: Who is God?" "Bibliatan estudiananchis. Bibliapin yachasun kaykunamanta: ¿Pitaq Diosri?"
"What evidence is there of his existence?" "¿Imaynapin yachanchis Dios kasqanta?"
"Does God really care about me?" ¿Munakuwanchu?
"What is God’s purpose for the future?" "¿Imatan ruwanqa jamuq tiempopi?"
"Evidence of God’s existence is all around us" "Imaymana pruebakunan kan Dios kasqanmanta"
"Jehovah’s Witnesses would be happy to help you study the Bible." "Testigokunaqa maytan munayku Bibliamanta yachanaykita."
"As stated on our website, jw.org, “Jehovah’s Witnesses love teaching people about the Bible, but we never force anyone to become a member of our religion." "Internetpi kaq direccionniykupin nin: “Testigokunaqa llapa runamanmi Bibliamanta yachachiyta munayku. Ichaqa manan pitapas obligaykuchu Testigo kapunanpaq."
"Rather, we respectfully present what the Bible says, recognizing that each person has the right to choose what he or she will believe. ”" "Creesqankuta respetaspan Bibliaq willasqallanta yachachiyku; sapanka estudianten ima ruwanantapas decidikunan ”, nispa."
"In the final analysis, your faith must be based on evidence that you observe as you weigh the truthfulness of what you read in the Bible." "Diospi iñinaykipaqqa pruebakunatan maskhanayki, jinaspapas Bibliapi yachachikuykunatan allinta entiendenayki."
"In that way, you will follow the example of first - century students who “accepted the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so. ” ​ — Acts 17: 11." "Chayta ruwanki chayqa ñaupa tiempo Biblia estudiaqkunaq ruwasqantan qatikunki. ‘ Paykunan Diospa siminta tukuy sonqo chaskikuranku, chaykunaqa jinapunichus kasqantataq Diospa Simin Qelqakunapi sapa p’unchay t’aqwiranku ’."
"“This means everlasting life, their coming to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ. ” ​ — John 17: 3." "“Wiñay kausayta chaskinankupaqqa qan sapallan cheqaq Diostan reqsinanku, reqsinallankutaqmi kachamusqayki Jesucristotapas ”"
"Emily: “I put down my fork and started to feel uneasy." "Emily nin: “Mijuyta qallariqtiy jinan simiy seqsiyta qallariran qalluytaq punkimuran."
"I had an itchy sensation in my mouth, and my tongue was swelling." "Manan samariyta atiranichu umaypas muyuytan qallariran."
"I started to feel light - headed and was having trouble breathing." "Chayllamanmi kunkaypi makiykunapipas qhopochakuna rijurimuran."
"I tried to stifle panic but knew I had to get to a hospital ​ — and quickly! ”" "Jinan hospitalta ¡usqhaylla pasarani! ”, nispa."
"FOR most people, eating is a pleasant experience." "YAQA llapa runakunan kusikunku mijuspa."
"There are some, however, who are compelled to treat certain foods as “enemies. ”" "Chaywanpas wakin runakunan wakin mijunakunata “enemigonkuta ” jina rikunku. ¿Imarayku?"
"Like Emily, quoted earlier, they suffer from food allergies." "Chaykunata mijuqtinku Emilyta jina alergia jap’isqanrayku."
"Emily’s severe allergic response is called anaphylaxis, a very dangerous condition." "Paytaqa anafilaxia nisqa alergian jap’iran, chayqa sinchi peligroson."
"Thankfully, most food allergies are not as serious." "Ichaqa wakin alergiakunaqa manan chhayna peligrosochu."
"In recent years, there has been a rise in reported food allergies and intolerances." "Ichaqa investigaq runakuna nisqan jina, doctorman rispan pisilla sut’itapuni yachanku chay onqoywan kasqankuta."
"Some studies, however, suggest that only a small portion of those who think they have a food allergy have been definitely diagnosed." "Chaywanpas yachaq runakunan ninku: ‘ Cuerponchispi defensakunan mijunamanta alergia onqoytaqa paqarichin ’, nispa."
"“Food allergy has no universally accepted definition, ” according to a group of scientists led by Dr." "Wakin mijuykunapin kan proteína nisqa, chay proteinayoq mijuykunata mijuqtinchismi alergia paqarin."
"Jennifer J." ¿Imaynapi?
"Schneider Chafen in their report published in The Journal of the American Medical Association." "Cuerponchispi defensakunan pantapakuspa chay proteinamanta cuerponchista defiendeyta qallarin."
"However, most experts believe that allergic reactions are primarily triggered by the immune system." "Cuerponchispi defensakunan IgE (Inmunoglobulina E) sutiyoq anticuerpo nisqata paqarichin mijusqanchis proteinakunata cuerponchismanta wijch’unanpaq."
"An allergic reaction to a certain food is typically a response to a protein in that food." "Qhepaman chay mijuykunata mijuqtinchisqa ñaupaqpi paqariq anticuerpo nisqakunan histamina nisqata cuerponchispi paqarichin jinaspa cuerponchista reaccionachimuyta qallarin."
"The immune system erroneously identifies that protein as harmful." "Histamina nisqaqa allinmi cuerponchispaq."
"When a particular protein enters the body, the immune system may create a type of antibody known as IgE to neutralize the perceived invader." "Ichaqa manan yachakunchu imaraykun wakin proteinakunata mijuqtinchis cuerponchispa defensankuna IgE nisqa anticuerpo nisqakunata paqarichisqanta, chay qhepaman histamina nisqa paqariqtin cuerponchispi alergia onqoy rijurisqantapas."
"When the food allergen is again ingested, the antibodies that were created earlier can trigger a release of chemicals, including histamine." "Chay proteinayoq mijuykunata chayllaraq mijuqtiykiqa manapaschá imatapas cuerpoyki reparanqachu."
"Under normal circumstances, histamine plays a beneficial role in the immune system." "Qhepaman kaqllata mijuqtiykin ichaqa cuerpoykipi alergia rijurimunqa."
"But for reasons not clearly understood, the presence of IgE antibodies and the subsequent release of histamine provoke an allergic reaction in people who happen to be hypersensitive to a particular food protein." "Chayqa manan mijunamanta alergia jinachu. Intolerancia alimentaria nispaqa nikun wijsanchis wakin mijuykunata mana chaskisqantan."
"This explains why you could eat a new food without any apparent reaction but eat the same food again and experience an allergic reaction." "Yaqapaschá wakin runakunaq cuerponpi mana kanchu enzimas nisqa otaq mijuykunapi kaq wakin alimentokunata mana chaskinchu jinaspa mijusqanchis wijsallanchispi sayan."
"A food intolerance, like a food allergy, may be an adverse reaction to a food item." "Wakintan chay pasan lecheta tomaqtinku."
"But unlike a food allergy (which is triggered directly by the immune system), a food intolerance is a reaction of the digestive system, and thus no antibodies are involved." "Lechepi, otaq lechemanta ruwasqa mijuykunapin kan lactosa nisqa, chaykunapi kaq azucarta cuerpoman ch’eqerichinanpaqmi ch’unchulninchis enzimas nisqata mana paqarichinchu."
"Basically, a person may have trouble breaking down a food, perhaps because of enzyme deficiencies or because of chemicals found in the food that are difficult to process." "Intolerancia alimentaria nisqaqa wijsanchispa mana chaskisqan mijunata mijuqtinchismi jap’ikun."
"For example, a lactose intolerance occurs when the gut does not produce the needed enzymes to digest the type of sugars found in milk products." "Ichaqa chay mijunakunata askhata otaq pisita mijusqanchismantan kanqa."
"As it is not a matter of the production of antibodies, a food intolerance can manifest itself the first time the food is ingested." "Pisillata mijusun chayqa manapaschá imanawasunpaschu, askhata mijuqtinchismi ichaqa wijsanchis mana chaskinmanchu."
"Quantity may be the determining factor ​ — a small amount of a certain food may be tolerated, but a problem may occur when larger amounts are ingested." "Mijunamanta alergiayoq runakunan ichaqa mana pisillatapas mijunankuchu, alergia jap’ichiq mijunakunaqa kaqraton kausayninkuta peligroman churanman."
"This is different from severe food allergies in which even a tiny amount of food can cause a life - threatening reaction." "Mijunamanta alergia pitapas jap’iqtinqa kunkan, ñawin, qallun iman punkiyta qallarin, seqsin, pukayamun ima."
"If you suffer from a food allergy, you could have itching; hives; swelling of the throat, eyes, or tongue; nausea; vomiting; or diarrhea." "Sonqonmi muyuyta qallarin, jinaspa aqtupakun otaq diarrea jap’in."
"And in a worst - case scenario, you could have a drop in blood pressure, dizziness, fainting, and even cardiac arrest." "Wakinpaqa cuerponmi chiriyan, uman muyun, desmayan otaq sonqon sayapun."
"An anaphylactic reaction can progress rapidly and be fatal." "Anafilaxia nisqa alergiayoq kaspaqa ratollan pipas wañunman."
"Potentially, any food could cause an allergy." "Mijunamanta alergia onqoytan paqarichinman: leche, runtu, challwa, marisco, trigo, maní, soya, frutos secos nisqakuna."
"However, the most severe food allergies are commonly caused by just a few foods: namely, milk, eggs, fish, crustaceans, peanuts, soybeans, tree nuts, and wheat." "Alergia onqoyqa jap’inmanmi juch’uytapas jatuntapas."
"A person can develop an allergy at any age." "Wakintaqa jap’in taytan otaq maman alergiayoq kasqanraykun."
"Studies show that genetics play an important role, and a child is more likely to develop an allergy if one or both of his parents have allergies." "Wakintaqa wawa kashaqtinmi jap’in ichaqa wiñasqanman jinan chinkapun."
"It is not uncommon for children to grow out of allergies." "Intolerancia alimentaria nisqan ichaqa mana nishu gravechu."
"Symptoms of food intolerance are generally less alarming than those of extreme allergic reactions." "Wijsanchispa mana chaskisqan mijuykunata mijuqtinchisqa wijsanchismi nanan, punkin, calambre ima jap’iwanchis; aychanchispin qhopochakuna rijurin, uma nanan, sayk’usqa sientekunchis otaq cuerponchis juj jina kapun."
"Food intolerance may cause stomach pain, bloating, gas, cramps, headaches, skin rash, tiredness, or a general feeling of malaise." "Chaytaqa paqarichin leche otaq lechemanta ruwasqa mijuykuna, trigo, gluten nisqa, alcoholniyoq ujanakuna otaq levadurayoq mijunakuna."
"An intolerance may be related to a variety of foods ​ — dairy, wheat, gluten, alcohol, and yeast are among the most common." "Sichus mijunamanta alergia jap’isunki otaq wijsayki mana chaskinchu wakin mijunakunata chayqa, doctormanmi rinayki."
"If you think you may suffer from a food allergy or a food intolerance, you may decide to get checked by a specialized health professional." "Manan kikillaykimantaqa mijuykunata prohibikunaykichu."
"Self - diagnosis and autonomously deciding to eliminate certain foods can at times be harmful, as you may inadvertently deprive your body of necessary nutrients." "Chayta ruwanki chayqa cuerpoykiq necesitasqan alimentokunatan prohibikushawaq jinaspa astawan onqowaq."
"There is no widely accepted treatment for severe food allergies other than the total avoidance of the particular foods that trigger the allergy." "Mijunamanta grave alergiayoq runakunaqa onqochisqan mijunakunatan manaña mijunankuchu."
"* On the other hand, if you have milder food allergies or food intolerance, you may see some benefit from simply reducing how often you eat certain foods and the amount." "* Ichaqa mana nishu grave alergiayoq otaq wakin mijuykunata wijsan mana chaskinchu chayqa, pisillatapas mayninqa mijunmanmi."
"In some cases, however, sufferers are compelled to avoid the foods in question altogether, or at least for some time, depending on the severity of the intolerance." "Onqochinman chayqa manañan pisillatapas mijunanchu. Sichus wakin mijunakunamanta alergiayoq kanki otaq wijsayki mana chaskinchu wakin mijunakunata chayqa, ama llakikuychu."
"So if you have a food allergy or a food intolerance, you may find comfort in knowing that many sufferers have learned to manage their condition and still enjoy a wide variety of nutritious and delicious foods." "Allpanchispiqa kanmi ajllarikunaykipaq imaymana clase sumaq mijuykuna. Chaytan ruwanku chay onqoyniyoq wakin runakunapas."
"It is often recommended that sufferers of severe allergies carry a special pen containing adrenaline (epinephrine) that can be self - injected in case of an emergency." "Doctorkunan ninku nishu grave alergiayoq runakuna adrenalina (epinefrina) nisqa jampita may risqankumanpas apanankupaq."
"Some health professionals suggest that children with allergies carry or wear some visible indication that can warn teachers or caregivers of their condition." "Wawakunapas colegioman otaq mayta rispapas chay onqoywan kasqankuta jujkuna yachananpaqmi ima señaltapas otaq qelqatapas apananku."
"WAS IT DESIGNED?" "¿KIKILLANMANTACHU PAQARIMURAN?"
"MECHANICAL ENGINEERS marvel at the ability of a common ant to lift weights many times heavier than its own body." "Chaymantapas investigarankun imaynapi cuerponmanta aswan llasata imatapas oqariy atisqanta."
"To understand this ability, engineers at Ohio State University, U.S.A., reverse engineered some of the ant’s anatomy, physical properties, and mechanical functions by means of computer models." "Tukuy chaykunawan yanapachikuspan computadorapi sisiq rijch’ayninta jina ruwaruranku cuerponta, imayna ruwasqa kasqanta, imayna funcionasqantawan estudianankupaq."
"The models were created using X - ray cross - sectional images (micro CT scans) and simulations of the forces an ant generates when carrying loads." "Sisikunaqa kunkankuwan yanapachikuspan siminkuwan ima llasakunatapas oqarinku."
"A critical part of the ant’s anatomy is its neck, which has to bear the full weight of loads grasped in its mouth." "Kunkanpin tupashan wasa tullunkuna uma tullunwan, chay tullu ukhupitaq kan jank’ukuna jina."
"Soft tissues within the ant’s neck bind with the stiff exoskeleton of its thorax (body) and head in a manner that mimics the interlocking of fingers in folded hands." "Chay tullukunawan jank’ukunawan iman simp’asqa jina kunkanpi jap’inasqa kashan. Juj ingenieron nin: “Chhayna jap’inasqa kasqanmi sisita yanapan kunkan kuyunanpaq."
"“The design and structure of this interface is critical for the performance of the neck joint, ” says one of the researchers." "Tullunkunapas jank’unkunapas imayna jap’inasqa kasqanmi sisiq umanta wasanwan allinta jujllachan."
"“The unique interface between hard and soft materials likely strengthens the adhesion and may be a key structural design feature that enables the large load capacity of the neck joint. ”" "Chaymi sisitaqa yanapashanman kunkanwan yanapachikuspa ima llasatapas oqarinanpaq ”, nispa."
"Researchers hope that a clear grasp of how the ant’s neck functions will contribute to advancements in the design of man - made robotic mechanisms." "Ingenierokunaqa astawanmi investigashanku imaynatapuni sisiq kunkan llasakuna oqarisqanta yachanankupaq, chaywan yanapachikuspa aswan allin robotkunata ruwanankupaq."
"What do you think?" "¿Ima ninkin chaymanta?"
"Did the ant’s neck with its complex and highly integrated mechanical systems evolve? Or was it designed?" "Sisiq kunkan chhayna admiranapaq ruwasqa kasqan, ¿kikillanmantachu paqariran icha kamasqachu karan?"

"Are there good habits that you would like to build in your life?" "Qanri, ¿munawaqchu juj allin costumbreyoq kayta?"
"Perhaps your goal is to exercise regularly, to get more sleep, or to keep in closer touch with loved ones." "Yaqapaschá munawaq astawan puñuyta, ejercicio ruwayta, familiaykikunawan rimayta ima."
"On the other hand, maybe you would like to break a bad habit, such as smoking cigarettes, eating too much junk food, or spending excessive time on the Internet." "Otaq munashanki mana allin costumbreta otaq viciota saqeyta, chaykunan kanman: fumay, mana alimentoyoq mijuykuna, nishu tiempo internetllapi kay ima."
"Admittedly, it can be difficult to overcome a bad habit. In fact, it has been said that a bad habit is like a warm bed on a cold day: it’s easy to get into and hard to get out of!" "Imaynan q’oñi camamanta mana faciltachu lloqsiyta munanchis, chhaynatan mana allin costumbrekunatapas mana faciltachu saqeyta atinchis."

"It can be tempting to try to change everything in your life immediately." "Yaqapaschá vidaykipi llapan mana allin costumbreykikunata cambiaruyta munawaq."
"You tell yourself, ‘ This week I’m going to stop smoking, stop swearing, stop staying up too late at night, start exercising, start eating better, and start calling my grandparents. ’" "Niwaqpaschá: “Kay semanan manaña fumapusaqchu, manaña nishu tardeta puñusaqchu, qhelli simikunatapas manaña rimasaqchu, aswanpas ejercicio ruwayta qallarisaq, aswan allinta mijusaq, abueloykunatapas telefonopi wajasaq ”, nispa."

"A modest person is realistic." "Allin yuyayniyoq runaqa atinallantan ruwan."
"He recognizes that there are limits to his time, energy, and resources." "Yachanmi tiemponpas, kallpanpas, ima kaqninpas tukukuqlla kasqanta."

"Work on your habits in realistic increments." "Pisi - pisimanta costumbreykikunata cambiay."
"The following steps may help:" "Yaqapaschá kaykuna yanapasunkiman."
"Create two ‘ master lists ’ ​ — a list of good habits that you would like to build and a list of any bad habits that you need to get rid of." "Iskay listata ruway: Jujninpi churay allin costumbre conseguiy munasqaykita, jujninpitaq saqepuy munasqaykikunata."
"Do not limit yourself; on each list, write down as many as you can think of." "Sapanka listapi umaykiman jamusqanta llapanta churay."
"Prioritize the items on your lists, numbering them in the order of importance to you." "Listapi sapanka costumbre churasqaykiman juj numerota churay, mayqentachus aswan importantepaq qhawarinki chayman jina."
"Choose a few habits ​ — even just one or two — ​ from each list, and focus on those." "Wakillanta listamanta ajllay, jujta otaq iskayllata, jinaspa kallpachakuy chaypi mejoranaykipaq."

"Speed up the process by replacing a bad habit with a good one." "Usqhaylla mana allin costumbrekunata saqenaykipaqqa allin costumbrekunatan ruwanayki."
"For example, if your list of bad habits includes watching too much TV and your list of good habits includes keeping in touch with loved ones, you could resolve: ‘ Instead of immediately turning on the TV when I get home from work each day, I will contact a friend or a relative and catch up. ’" "Ejemplopaq, yaqapaschá manaña nishutachu televisión qhawayta munanki, aswanpas familiaykikunawan rimayta munanki.

ANSWERS: "BIBLIAQ KUTICHIYNIN:"
TRUE. CHEQAQ.
"The Bible says: “Men who practice homosexuality... will not inherit God’s Kingdom. ”" "Biblian nin ‘ qharipura puñuqkuna ’ Diospa gobiernonman mana jaykunankuta."
"The same applies to women. ​ — Romans 1: 26." "Kaqllatataqmi nin warmikunamantapas."
FALSE. FALSO.
"The Bible teaches that sex should be engaged in only by a male and a female who are married to each other. ​ — Genesis 1: 27, 28; Proverbs 5: 18, 19." "Biblian yachachin warmiwan qhariwan casarakuspalla puñuy atisqankuta (Génesis 1: 27, 28; Proverbios 5: 18, 19)."
FALSE. FALSO.
"Although the Bible condemns homosexual acts, it does not encourage prejudice, hate crimes, or any other kind of mistreatment of homosexuals. ​ — Romans 12: 18." "Bibliaqa juchachanña qharipura otaq warmipura puñuyta chaypas, manan chay runakunata cheqnikuytachu yachachin; nitaq paykuna contra jatarispa mana allin trataytapaschu."
"Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that the Bible’s moral code is the best standard for living, and they choose to abide by that code." "Noqaykuqa creeykun Bibliapi kamachikuykuna allinpuni kasqanta, chaymi chayman jina kausayku (Isaías 48: 17)."
"This means that Jehovah’s Witnesses reject all sexual misconduct, including homosexuality." "Chayraykun rechazayku Bibliaq juchachasqan ruwaykunata, chaypin kashan qharipura warmipura puñuypas."
"That is the Witnesses ’ lifestyle choice, and they have a right to it." "Testigokunaqa chay jina kausaytan ajllakuyku, derechoykupitaqmi kashayku chayta ruwanaykupaq."
"Jehovah’s Witnesses strive to follow the Golden Rule by treating others the way they themselves would like to be treated" "Testigokunaqa Bibliaq nisqanman jinan jujkunata sumaqta tratayku, imaynan noqaykupas tratasqa kayta munayku jinata"
"At the same time, Jehovah’s Witnesses strive to “pursue peace with all people. ”" "Kallpachakuykun ‘ lliu runawan thajpi kanaykupaqpas ’."
"While they reject homosexual acts, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not force their view on others, nor do they participate in homophobic hate crimes or rejoice when they hear of them." "Noqaykuqa mana allinpaqña qhawariyku qharipura warmipura puñuyta chaypas, manan jujkunata obligaykuchu noqayku jina piensanankupaq, manan qharipura warmipura puñuqkunatapas maltrataykuchu."
"Jehovah’s Witnesses strive to follow the Golden Rule by treating others the way they themselves would like to be treated. ​ — Matthew 7: 12." "Manan chaykuna pasaqtinpas kusikuykuchu."
"Still, some people would say that the Bible promotes prejudice against homosexuals and that those who adhere to its moral code are intolerant." "Tukuy atisqaykutan ruwayku Bibliaq kamachisqanman jina jujkunata tratanaykupaq, imaynatachus tratawanankuta munayku chayman jina tratanaykupaq."
"‘ The Bible was written at a time when people were narrow - minded, ’ they claim." "Wakinmi piensanku Biblia qharipura puñuqkuna cheqnikuyta yachachinanpaq."
"‘ Today we accept people of all races, nationalities, and sexual preferences. ’" "Chayman jina kausaqkunatataq piensayninkuta mana cambiay munaq runakunata jina qhawarinku."
"To them, rejecting homosexuality is the same as rejecting people of a different skin color." "Chhaynata piensaqkunapaqqa qharipura puñuqkunata rechazayqa kaqllan juj colorniyoq runakunata rechazaywan."
"Is that comparison valid?" "Ichaqa, ¿allinchu chay jinata comparay?"
No. Manan.
"Why not? Because there is a difference between rejecting homosexual conduct and rejecting homosexual people." "Qharipura otaq warmipura puñuy comportamientota rechazayqa manan kaqllachu chhaynata kausaq runakunata rechazaywan."
"The Bible tells Christians to be respectful of all kinds of people." "Bibliaqa cristianokunatan nin tukuy clase runakunata respetanankupaq."
"But that does not mean that Christians must accept all kinds of conduct." "Ichaqa manan chaywanqa nishanchu cristianokuna tukuy clase comportamientota aceptanankuta."
"Consider a comparison: Suppose you view smoking as harmful and even repugnant." "Juj ejemplota churasun."
"What if you have a workmate who is a smoker? Would you be considered narrow - minded just because your view of smoking differs from his?" "Yaqapachá cigarro fumayta cuerpoykipaq mana allin kasqanta qhawarinki, llank’anaykipi compañeroykitaq fumaq runa."
"Would the fact that he smokes and you do not smoke automatically mean that you are prejudiced against him?" "¿Mana imatapas aceptaq runa jinachu qhawarisqa kawaq mana compañeroyki jina piensasqaykimanta?"
"If your workmate were to demand that you change your view of smoking, would that not make him narrow - minded and intolerant?" "¿Mana fumasqaykiraykuchu jujkunata cheqnikuq runa jina qhawarisqa kawaq?"
"Jehovah’s Witnesses choose to live by the moral code set forth in the Bible." "Sichus compañeroyki obligasunkiman fumaymanta piensasqaykita cambianaykipaq chayqa, ¿manachu chay mana imatapas aceptaq runaman payta tukuchinman?"
"They do not approve of the actions that the Bible prohibits." "Testigokunaqa Bibliaq kamachisqanman jina ruwanaykupaqmi decidikuyku, chaymi Bibliaq prohibisqan ruwaykunata mana ruwaykuchu."
"But they neither mock nor mistreat people whose practices differ from their own." "Ichaqa manan burlakuykuchu nitaq pisichaykuchu jujnirayta ruwaq runakunata."
"What about people who have homosexual inclinations?" "¿Ima nisunmanmi qharipura warmipura puñuyta munaq runakunamanta?"
"Were they born that way?" "¿Chhaynachu naceranku?"
"If so, would it not be cruel to say that it is wrong for them to act on their desires?" "Chhayna kaqtinqa, ¿juchachu kanman paykunata criticay?"
"The Bible does not comment on the biology of homosexuality, although it acknowledges that some human traits are deeply ingrained." "Bibliaqa manan ninchu imarayku warmipura qharipura tiyasqankuta ichaqa ninmi wakin runakunapi mana allin pensamientokuna saphichakusqanta."
"Still, the Bible says that certain conduct ​ — including homosexual acts — ​ must be shunned if we are to please God. ​ — 2 Corinthians 10: 4, 5." "Ichaqa sichus Diospa allin qhawarisqan kayta munanchis chayqa, Bibliaq juchachasqan ruwaykunatan mana ruwananchischu, chaypin kashan qharipura warmipura puñuypas."
"Some would say that the Bible’s position is cruel." "Wakinqa piensankun Bibliaq kamachisqan nishu estricto kananpaq."
"But their claim is based on the premise that we must act on our impulses or that sexual impulses in particular are so important that they should not ​ — even cannot — ​ be controlled." "Ichaqa chhayna piensayqa “cuerponchispa munayninman jinan ruwananchis ” niq runakunamantan jamun, wakintaq ninku:“ Cuerponchispa munaynintaqa manan controlayta atisunmanchu nitaqmi controlananchischu ”, nispa."
"However, the Bible dignifies humans by stating that they can resist their urges." "Biblian ichaqa willan controlay atikusqanta."
"Unlike animals, they can choose not to act on their impulses. ​ — Colossians 3: 5." "Animalkunaqa kikillankumantan ruwanku, runakunan ichaqa atinchis decidiyta ima ruwayta ima mana ruwaytapas."
"Consider a comparison: Some experts say that certain behavioral traits, such as aggression, may have a biological cause." "Kay ejemplopi piensay. Investigaqkunan ninku wakin runaqa juj comportamientoyoq nacesqankuta, yaqapaschá maqakuq runa kanman."
"The Bible does not specifically comment on the biology of aggression, but it does acknowledge that some people are “prone to anger ” and“ disposed to rage. ”" "Bibliaqa manan willanchu runakuna millay comportamientoyoq nacesqankuta, ichaqa willanmi ‘ saltaq sonqo ’ ‘ k’araq phiñakuq ’ runakunamanta (Proverbios 22: 24; 29: 22)."
"Yet, the Bible also says: “Let go of anger and abandon rage. ” ​ — Psalm 37: 8; Ephesians 4: 31." "Chaymi nin: “Qankunamanta wijch’upuychis tukuy ima sintipakuq kayta, phiñasqa kayta ”, nispa (Salmo 37: 8; Efesios 4: 31)."
"Few people would disagree with that advice or say that it is cruel to those who have aggressive tendencies." "Wakillanmi Bibliapi chay nisqanwanqa mana acuerdopichu kankuman."
"In fact, even those experts who believe that anger is rooted in a person’s genetic makeup work hard to help people control such tendencies." "Yaqapaschá ninkuman: “Chay consejoqa nishu estricton maqakuq runakunapaq ”, nispa."
"Jehovah’s Witnesses take a similar position toward any conduct that conflicts with Bible standards, including sexual acts between two people of the opposite sex who are not married to each other." "Chhaynatan piensanku mana casado kashaspa warmi - qhari puñuymantapas. Chaykunamanta rimaspan Biblia nin: “Sapankaykichismi yachanaykichis cuerpoykichis kamachiyta, chhaynapi ch’uya kanaykichispaq allin qhawarisqa kanaykichispaqwan."
"In all such cases, the Bible counsel applies: “Each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not with greedy, uncontrolled sexual passion. ” ​ — 1 Thessalonians 4: 4, 5." "Ama Diosta mana reqsiq [...] runakuna jinaqa kaychischu, paykunaqa mana controlakuspan sinchita warminayachikunku qharinayachikunku ima, manan chaykunawanqa amikunkupaschu ”, nispa."
"Those who wanted to become Christians in the first century came from various backgrounds and lifestyles, and some of them made significant lifestyle changes." "Qallariy siglopi cristianoman tukupuyta munaq runakunaq kausayninqa jujniraymi ñaupaqpi karan, juj llaqtakunamantataq karankupas."
"For example, the Bible speaks of “those who are sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, men who submit to homosexual acts, ” and then it adds:“ That is what some of you were. ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 6: 9 - 11." "Wakinqa jatun cambiokunatan vidankupi ruwananku karan. Ejemplopaq, qhelli juchapi puriqkunamanta, ídolo adoraqkunamanta, warmipura otaq qharipura puñuqkunamanta rimaspan Biblia nin: “Chhaynan wakinniykichisqa karankichis ”, nispa."
"In saying “that is what some of you were, ” does the Bible mean that those who stopped engaging in homosexual acts never again experienced any homosexual desires?" "Chaywan nishanchu, ¿warmipura otaq qharipura puñuqkuna manaña jayk’aqpas chayta munananku kasqanta?"
"That could hardly be the case, because the Bible also exhorts: “Keep walking by spirit and you will carry out no fleshly desire. ” ​ — Galatians 5: 16." "Manan. Bibliaqa nillantaqmi: “Diospa espiritunman jinallapuni purishaychis, chhaynapin mana aychaq ima munaynintapas ruwankichischu ”, nispa."
"Note that the Bible does not say that a Christian will never experience an improper desire. Rather, it says that he or she will choose not to carry out that desire." "Bibliaqa manan nishanchu cristianokuna mana jayk’aqpas chaykuna munanankuta, aswanpas decidinkun mana ruwanankupaq."
"Christians learn to bring such desires under control, not dwelling on them to the point of acting on them. ​ — James 1: 14, 15." "Arí, controlakunkun chaypi mana piensanankupaq, chhaynapi mana urmanankupaq."
"The Bible thus makes a distinction between inclinations and practices." "Biblian riman munaymanta ruwaymantapas."
"A person who has homosexual leanings can control what he allows his mind to dwell on, just as he would control any other wrong desire, including leanings toward anger, adultery, and greed. ​ — 1 Corinthians 9: 27; 2 Peter 2: 14, 15." "Qharipura puñuyta munaq runakunaqa atinkumanmi piensayninku controlayta, imaynan controlanku renegayninkuta, jujwan pantayta otaq sinchi munapayayninkutapas jinata."
"While Jehovah’s Witnesses uphold the moral code set forth in the Bible, they do not force their views on others." "Jehová Diospa testigonkunaqa kasukuykun Bibliapi kamachikuykunata, ichaqa manan pitapas obligaykuchu noqayku jina piensanankupaqqa."
"Nor do they try to reverse laws that protect the human rights of those whose lifestyle differs from theirs." "Manataqmi jujnirayta kausaq runakunata protegeq leykuna contrapas kaykuchu."
"The message that Jehovah’s Witnesses bear is a positive one, and they eagerly share it with all who will listen. ​ — Acts 20: 20." "Willasqaykuqa runakunatan yanapan, chaymi uyarikuqkunaman willayku."

"But young people have less history on which to draw." "Kuraqkunan ichaqa yachankuña sasachakuykuna atipayta, ñaupaqpi imaymana pasasqankuwan."

"Satan has surely proved adept at blinding human minds. ​ — 2 Corinthians 4: 4." "Kaywanmi yachanchis Satanás runakunaq yuyaynin tutayachiypi allin yachaysapa kasqanta."
"What difficult question can we help people to answer, and why are we in a unique position to do so?" "¿Ima sasa tapuytan kutichisunman; ima raykutaq ñoqallanchis atisunman kutichiyta?"
"As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we are in a unique position to help people who are being deceived by Satan and the wisdom of this world." "Jehová Diospa testigonkunallan atisunman yanapayta Satanaspa, kay pachaq yachayninkunawan q’otusqa kaq runakunata."
"We see why many do not believe in the Bible’s promises. They simply do not know Jehovah." "Wakin runakunaqa mana iñinkuchu Bibliaq willasqan promesakunapi Jehová Diosta mana reqsisqanku rayku."
"They may not know his name or its significance, and they likely know little or nothing of his qualities or of his record in keeping his promises." "Manapaschá yachankuchu sutinta, chay sutin ima ninanta, nitaq yachankuchu sumaq kayninkunamanta, promesankuna Hunt’aq kasqantapas."
"We are blessed to have such knowledge." "Ñoqanchismi ichaqa chaykunamanta yachanchis."
"From time to time, it is good for us to review how we can help people who are “in darkness mentally ” to find the answer to one of the hardest questions humans ask,“ Why does God allow evil and suffering? ”" "Chay rayku yuyarishanallanchis imaynata yanapasunman “tutayasqa ” yuyayniyoq runakunata, kay sasa tapukuyninkuta kutichispa: ¿ima rayku Dios hinallata qhawan mana allinkunata ñak’ariykunatapas?"
"First we will consider how to approach the answer effectively. Then we will discuss how Jehovah’s qualities are evident in the way he has handled the matter of evil." "Ñawpaqtaqa qhawarisun imakunata ruwananchis allinta kutichinapaq, chaymanta qhawarillasuntaq imaynatan Jehová Dios sumaq kayninkunata rikuchin mana allin kaqta allichasqanpi."

"What may we need to do first when someone raises the question of why God permits suffering?" "¿Imatan ñawpaqta ruwananchis pipas: ima rayku Dios hinallata qhawan ñak’ariykuna kananta nispa tapukuqtin?"
Explain. Willay.
"When someone asks why God allows suffering, how do we respond?" "¿Ima rayku Dios hinallata qhawan ñak’ariykuna kananta?, nispa pipas tapukuqtin, ¿imaynata kutichinchis?"
"We may be inclined to launch right into a detailed explanation, starting with what happened in the garden of Eden." "Yaqapaschá willayta qallarinchis Edén huertapi imakuna sucedesqanmanta."
"In some cases, that may be fine. A word of caution is in order, though. Some groundwork may be needed." "Mayninpiqa allinmi kanman chhayna kutichiy, ichaqa aswan allinta kutichinapaqqa kaykunataraqmi ruwananchis (Proverbios 25: 11; Colosenses 4: 6)."
"Let us consider three Scriptural points that we may want to establish briefly before delving into the answer to the question." "Manaraq tapuyninkuta kutichishaspa kaykunataraq ruwananchis."
"First, if the person is particularly disturbed about the prevalence of evil in the world, it is likely that evil has touched him or his loved ones personally." "Huknin kaq, sichus pipas llakikun mana allin kawsay kasqanmanta chayqa, yaqapaschá paypas otaq familianpas ñak’ariypi tarikuranku."
"It may be wise, then, to start by showing genuine empathy." "Chhayna kaqtinqa khuyapayananchismi."
"The apostle Paul counseled Christians: “Weep with people who weep. ”" "Apóstol Pablon cristianokunata niran: ‘ Waqaqkunawan waqaychis ’, nispa."
"Showing empathy, or “fellow feeling, ” may touch the person." "Sichus khuyapayakuq ‘ llakipayakuq ’ kasun chayqa, sonqontapaschá kuyurichisunman."
"If he understands that we care about him, he is more likely to listen to what we have to say." "Paypi interesakusqanchista reparanqa chayqa, astawanpaschá uyariyta munanman."
"6, 7." "6, 7."
"Why might we rightly commend a sincere person who raises a troubling spiritual question?" "¿Ima raykun allin sonqowan Bibliaq yachachisqanmanta tapukuqta ninanchis, allinmi chay tapukusqayki nispa?"
"Second, we may commend the sincere person for raising this question." "Iskay kaq, allinmi chay tapukusqayki nispan niwaq."
"Some people conclude that because they struggle with such questions, they are faithless or disrespectful toward God." "Wakinqa chhaynata tapukusqanku rayku, yuyanku mana iñiyniyoq kanankupaq otaq Diosta mana manchakuq kanankupaq."
"They may even have been told as much by a clergyman." "Chhaynatapaschá iglesiankupi umalliqninkupas niran."
"However, that is not necessarily the case." "Ichaqa manan mana iñiyniyoqkunallachu chhaynata tapukunku, ñawpa tiempopi Dios sonqo runakunapas chay hinatan tapukuranku."
"After all, faithful people in Bible times asked similar questions." "Davidmi Diosta niran: “Señor Diosníy, ¿imanaqtintaq karupi kashanki?"
"For example, the psalmist David asked: “Why, O Jehovah, do you keep standing afar off?" "¿Imanaqtintaq khuyayta llakikushaqtiypas pakakunki? ” nispa (Salmo 10: 1)."
"Why do you keep yourself hid in times of distress? ”" "¿Hayk’aqkamataq: ¡Sarunchashawankun!"
"Similarly, the prophet Habakkuk asked: “How long, O Jehovah, must I cry for help, and you do not hear?" "nispa qaparimusqayki, manataq qespichiwankichu?"
"How long shall I call to you for aid from violence, and you do not save?" "¿Imanaqtintaq mana chaninkaqta rikuchiwanki?"
"Why is it that you make me see what is hurtful, and you keep looking upon mere trouble?" "¿Imanaqtintaq ñak’arichiytaqa ch’inlla qhawanki?"
"And why are despoiling and violence in front of me, and why does quarreling occur, and why is strife carried? ” ​ — Habakkuk 1: 2, 3." "Runa ch’utiqllatan runa maqaqllatan rikushani, quejanakushankun churanakushankun ”, nispa (Habacuc 1: 2, 3)."
"These were faithful men who had a great deal of respect for God." "Chay runakunaqa anchatan Diosta manchakuranku."
"Were they rebuked for raising such troubling questions?" "¿Phiñakuranchu Dios chhayna tapusqankumanta?"
"On the contrary, Jehovah saw fit to have their sincere questions recorded in his Word." "Manan, aswanmi Jehová Diosqa Bibliapi qelqachiran tapukusqankuta."
"Today, a person who struggles with the prevalence of evil may actually be hungering spiritually ​ — longing for answers that only the Bible can provide." "Kunan tiempopi mana allinkuna kasqanwan llakikuq runaqa, maytapaschá munashan tapukuyninman kutichiykuna tariyta, Bibliallapin chay tapukuyninman kutichiykunata tarinman."
"Remember, Jesus spoke well of those who are spiritually hungry, or who are “conscious of their spiritual need. ”" "Jesusqa allinta rimaran ‘ Diosta maskhaqkunamanta ’ otaq Diospa munayninta yachay munaqkunamanta."
"What a privilege it is to help such ones find the happiness that Jesus promised!" "May sumaqpunin paykunata yanapayqa, chhaynapin Jesuspa nisqan hina kusi kawsayta tarinkuman."
"What confusing teachings have led people to believe that God is responsible for suffering, and how can we help them?" "¿Ima yachachikuykunan runakunata pantachin, Diostapas rikuchin ñak’ariykuna paqarichiqta hina?"
"Third, we may need to help the person to see that God is not responsible for the wickedness so prevalent in the world." "Kinsa kaq, yaqapaschá tapukuqman yachachinanchis runakunaq ñak’arisqanmanta Diosqa manan huchayoq kasqanta."
"Many people are taught that God is ruling this world that we live in, that God long ago determined everything that happens to us, and that he has mysterious, inscrutable reasons for inflicting misery on mankind." "Askha runakunamanmi yachachinku, Diosmi kay pachata kamachishan nispa, paymi ñawpaq tiempokunamantaraq allicharanña imakuna kananta, manataq yachasunmanchu ima rayku ñak’arichiwasqanchistapas, nispa."
"These teachings are false." "¡Chayqa yanqa rimaymi!"
"They dishonor God and make him out to be responsible for the wickedness and suffering in the world." "Chay yachachikuykunaqa Diostan pisichan, hinaspapas Diostan rikuchin mana allinkunata ñak’ariykunatapas paqarichiqta hina."
"So we may have to use God’s Word to set such matters straight." "Chay raykun Diospa Simin Qelqawan sut’iman horqonanchis chay yachachikuykunata."
"Jehovah is not the ruler of this corrupt system of things; Satan the Devil is." "Jehová Diosqa manan kay millay pachata kamachinchu, aswanpas Saqran kay pachata kamachishan."
"Jehovah does not predestine his intelligent creatures; he gives each one freedom and opportunities to choose between good and bad, right and wrong." "Jehová Diosqa manan yuyaykuranñachu kamasqankuna imayna kanankuta, aswanmi paykunata kamaran kikinkumanta allin kaqta mana allin kaqtapas akllakunankupaq (Deuteronomio 30: 19)."
"And Jehovah is never the source of wickedness; he hates wickedness and cares for those who suffer unjustly. ​ — Job 34: 10; Proverbs 6: 16 - 19; 1 Peter 5: 7." "Chaymantapas Jehová Diosqa manan mana allinkuna paqarichiqchu; aswanmi mana allin kaqta cheqnikun llakikuntaq mana imamanta runakunata ñak’arichiqtinku (Job 34: 10; Proverbios 6: 16 - 19; 1 Pedro 5: 7)."
"What are some tools that “the faithful and discreet slave ” has provided in order to help people understand why Jehovah God permits suffering?" "Ima rayku Dios ñak’ariykuna hinalla qhawasqanmanta sut’inchanapaq, ¿ima qelqakunata “allin yuyayniyoq hunt’aq kamachi ” qowanchis?"
"Once you have laid such groundwork, you may find that your listener is ready to learn why God allows suffering to continue." "Chaykunata allinta reparachispañan sut’inchasunman ima rayku Dios hinallata ñak’ariykuna qhawasqanta."
"To help you, “the faithful and discreet slave ” has provided a number of tools." "Chaypaqmi “allin yuyayniyoq hunt’aq kamachi ” qowanchis askha qelqakunata. 2005 watapi“ Diosta Kasukuy ” nisqa distrito asambleapi lloqsimuran Pronto acabará el sufrimiento nisqa tratado."
"For instance, at the “Godly Obedience ” District Convention of 2005 / 06, a tract entitled All Suffering Soon to End! was released." "Kallpachakunanchismi chay tratadota allinta t’aqwinanchispaq."
"If this tract is available in your language, why not familiarize yourself with its contents?" "¿Qué enseña realmente la Biblia?"
"Similarly, the book What Does the Bible Really Teach?, now available in 157 languages, devotes a chapter to this important question." "nisqa libropas 157 simikunapin lloqsimun, chaypi huknin capitulonpi rimashan ima rayku Dios ñak’ariykunata hinalla qhawasqanmanta."
"Make full use of such tools. They clearly explain the Scriptural background of the issue of universal sovereignty that was raised in Eden and why Jehovah handled that challenge as he did." "Chay qelqakunawan allinta yanapachikusun, chaykunan willashan Bibliaq nisqanman hina, imaynapichus Edén huertapi Diospa kamachikuyninmanta iskayay qallarisqanta, willallantaq ima rayku Jehová Dios chhayna ruwasqanta."
"Keep in mind, too, that as you discuss this subject, you are opening up to your listener the most important field of knowledge there is." "Ñak’ariymanta rimaspaqa runakunata yanapashanchis aswan allin yachayta tarinankupaq: Jehová Diosmanta, sumaq kayninkunamantapas yachayta."
"It is the knowledge of Jehovah and his wonderful qualities." "Jehová Diospa sumaq kayninkunata rikuchisun"
"Focus on Jehovah’s Qualities" "¿Iman yanapanman allinta entiendenankupaq?"
"What do many find it hard to understand about God’s permission of suffering, and what knowledge may help them?" "¿Ima rayku Dios mana hark’aranchu Saqraq yuyaychayninwan runakunaq kamachikunankuta?"
"As you help people to understand why Jehovah has allowed humans to rule themselves under Satan’s influence, try to draw attention to Jehovah’s wonderful qualities." "Chayta sut’inchaspaqa rikuchinanchismi Jehová Diospa sumaq kayninkunata."
"Many people know that God is powerful; they are used to hearing him called God Almighty." "Askhan yachanku Dios atiyniyoq kasqanta; uyarillankutaq payqa Tukuy Atiyniyoqmi nisqankutapas."
"However, they may find it hard to grasp why he does not use his great power to end injustice and suffering right away." "Chaymi ninku, ima raykun Dios atiyniyoq kashaspa mana tukuchinchu mana chanin kawsaytapas ñak’ariytapas, nispa."
"They probably lack an understanding of Jehovah’s other qualities, such as his holiness, justice, wisdom, and love." "Manapaschá entiendenkuchu Jehová Diospa kay sumaq kayninkunata: ch’uya kayninta, chanin kayninta, yachayniyoq kayninta, munakuq kaynintapas."
"Jehovah displays these traits in a perfect, balanced way. The Bible thus says: “Perfect is his activity. ”" "Chay sumaq kayninkunatan Diosqa allinta tupachin; chaymi Biblia Diosmanta nin: “Hunt’asqan ruwasqankunaqa ”, nispa (Deuteronomio 32: 4)."
"How can you bring these qualities to the fore as you answer questions that are often raised on this issue?" "¿Imaynatan Diospa sumaq kayninkunata rikuchisunman ñak’ariymanta tapukusqankuta kutichiqtinchis?"
"Let us consider a few examples." "Qhawasunchis wakinta."
"11, 12. (a) Why was forgiveness not an option when Adam and Eve sinned?" "11, 12. (a) ¿Ima rayku Dios mana Adanta Evatapas panpacharanchu?"
"(b) Why will Jehovah not tolerate sin forever?" "(b) ¿Ima rayku Jehová Dios mana wiñaypaqchu qhawanqa huchaq kananta?"
"Could Jehovah simply have forgiven Adam and Eve?" "¿Manachu Jehová Dios panpachanman karan Adantapas Evatapas?"
"Forgiveness was never an option in this case." "Manan chayqa atikunmanchu karan."
"As perfect humans, Adam and Eve made a deliberate choice to reject Jehovah’s sovereignty and to accept the guidance of Satan instead." "Paykunaqa ch’uya kashaspan yuyaypipuni qhepancharanku Jehová Diospa kamachikuyninta, hinaspa Satanaspa kamachisqanta ruwaranku."
"Not surprisingly, there was no sign of repentance on the part of the rebels." "Chhaynapi yachanchis paykunaqa mana pesapakusqankuta."
"However, when people ask about forgiveness in the matter, they may actually be wondering why Jehovah did not simply lower his standard and tolerate the existence of sin and rebellion." "Ichaqa pipas tapukunman ima rayku Dios mana panpacharanchu Adantapas Evatapas nispa chayqa, kay hinatan nishan: kamachikuyninta p’akispan riki huchatapas pay contra hatariytapas hinallata qhawanman karan nispa."
"The answer involves a quality that is essential to Jehovah’s very nature ​ — his holiness. ​ — Exodus 28: 36; 39: 30." "Chayta sut’inchanapaqqa yachananchismi Diosninchis ch’uya kasqanta (Éxodo 28: 36; 39: 30, NM)."
"The Bible emphasizes Jehovah’s holiness hundreds of times. Sadly, though, few people in this corrupt world understand that quality." "Jehová Dios ch’uya kasqanmantaqa Bibliapin askha kutita rimakun, ichaqa kay pachapi runakunamantaqa pisillan entiendenku ima ninanta."
"Jehovah is clean, pure, and separate from all sinfulness." "Jehová Diosqa ch’uyan, ima huchamantapas t’aqasqa (Isaías 6: 3; 59: 2)."
"When it comes to sin, he has arranged for a means of atoning for it, wiping it away, but he will not tolerate it forever." "Huchataqa chinkachinqan, manan wiñaypaqchu qhawanqa huchaq kananta."
"If Jehovah were willing to tolerate sin eternally, we would have no hope for the future." "Wiñaypaqchus hinallata huchaq kananta qhawanman chayqa, manan kanmanñachu ima suyakuypas (Proverbios 14: 12)."
"In his due time, Jehovah will bring all creation back into a state of holiness." "Señalasqan tiempopin Diosqa lliw kamasqanta ch’uyaman tukuchinqa."
"That is certain, for it is the will of the Holy One." "Chayqa hunt’akunqapunin Ch’uya Diospa munaynin kasqan rayku."
"13, 14." "13, 14."
"Why did Jehovah choose not to destroy the rebels in Eden?" "¿Ima rayku Jehová Dios paypa contranpi churakuqkunata mana kaqpachachu wañuchiran?"
"Could Jehovah merely have destroyed the rebels in Eden and started over?" "¿Manachu Jehová Dios Adanta Evatapas wañuchispa mosoq runakunata kamanman karan?"
"He certainly had the power to do so; soon he will use that power to destroy all the wicked." "Jehová Diosqa atiyniyoqmi karan wañuchinanpaq, pisi tiempollamantan lliw millay runakunata wañuchinqa."
"‘ Why, ’ some may wonder, ‘ did he not do so when there were only three sinners in the universe?" "Chaymi wakinqa tapukunku: “¿Ima raykutaq kinsallaraq mana kasukuqkuna kashaqtin mana wañuchiranchu?"
"Would not the spread of sin ​ — and all the misery we see in the world — ​ have been prevented? ’" "¿Manachu chaywan huchaq mast’arikunanta hark’anman karan, chay hawa kay pachapi tukuy ñak’ariykuna kasqantapas? ” nispa."
"Why did Jehovah not choose that course of action?" "¿Ima rayku Jehová Dios mana chayta ruwaranchu?"
"Deuteronomy 32: 4 says: “All his ways are justice. ”" "Deuteronomio 32: 4 nin: “Chaninmi ruwasqankunaqa ”, nispa."
"Jehovah feels very strongly about justice." "Jehová Diosqa chanin kayman hinapuni imatapas ruwan."
"In fact, “Jehovah is a lover of justice. ”" "Payqa ‘ chanin [kaqtan] munakun ’ (Salmo 37: 28)."
"Because of his love of justice, Jehovah refrained from wiping out the rebels in Eden." "Chanin kaqta munakuspanmi mana wañuchiranchu Edén huertapi pay contra hatariqkunata."
Why? "¿Ima rayku chayta ninchis?"
"Satan’s rebellion raised a question regarding the rightness of God’s sovereignty." "Diospa contranpi hatarispan Satanasqa kay hinata niran: Diospa kamachikuyninqa manan chaninchu, nispa."
"Jehovah’s sense of justice required that Satan’s challenge be given a just answer." "Jehová Dios chanin kasqan raykun, chanin kayninman hina Satanasman kutichinan karan."
"The immediate execution of the rebels, while well - deserved, would not have provided such an answer." "Pay contra hatariqkunata kaqpacha wañuchiy allinña kanman karan chaypas, manan chanin kutichiychu kanman karan."
"It would have provided further evidence of Jehovah’s supremacy in power, but his power was not in question." "Chaywanqa rikuchinman karan tukuy atiyniyoq kasqanta, ichaqa manan Diospa atiynin contrachu Saqraqa hatariran."
"Furthermore, Jehovah had stated his purpose to Adam and Eve. They were to have offspring and were to fill the earth, subdue it, and have all earthly creation in subjection." "Chaymantapas Diosqa ñan nisqaña Adán Evata: Askhata miraychis, kay Allpaman hunt’aykuychis, Allpata cuidaychis, llapa animalkunatapas kamachiychis, nispa (Génesis 1: 28)."
"If Jehovah had simply destroyed Adam and Eve, his stated purpose regarding humans would have become empty words." "Jehová Dios Adanta Evatapas wañuchiqtinqa runakunapaq ima yuyaykusqanqa yanqapi tukunman karan."
"Jehovah’s justice would never allow for such an outcome, for his purpose is always accomplished. ​ — Isaiah 55: 10, 11." "Jehová Diosqa chanin kayninpi manapuni munanchu chay sucedenanta, payqa hunt’anpunin rimasqanta (Isaías 55: 10, 11)."
"15, 16." "15, 16."
"When people propose alternative “solutions ” to the challenge raised in Eden, how may we be able to help them?" "Edén huertapi sucedesqanmanta pipas “khaynata ” aswan ruwakunman karan niqtinri, ¿imaynatan yanapasunman?"
"Could anyone in the universe address the rebellion with greater wisdom than Jehovah?" "¿Pipas Jehová Diosmanta aswan yachayniyoq kanmanchu Edén huertapi paypa contranpi hatariyta allichananpaq?"
"Some people might propose their own “solutions ” to the rebellion in Eden." "Wakinqa ninku, “khaynata ” ruwakunman karan chayqa allichakunmanmi karan, nispa."
"In doing so, however, would they not be suggesting that they could think of better ways to handle the issue?" "¿Manachu chaywan nishanku Diosmanta aswan yachayniyoq kasqankuta?"
"They might not do so out of a wicked motive, but they do not have an understanding of Jehovah and his awe - inspiring wisdom." "Allin sonqowanpaschá chayta nishanku ichaqa manan Jehová Diosta reqsinkuchu nitaq yachankuchu ancha yachayniyoq kasqanmanta."
"In writing to Christians in Rome, the apostle Paul delved deeply into God’s wisdom, including the “sacred secret ” regarding Jehovah’s purpose to use the Messianic Kingdom to bring about the redemption of faithful mankind and to sanctify His holy name." "Roma llaqtapi cristianokunaman carta qelqasqanpin apóstol Pablo Diospa yachayninmanta rimaran. Payqa rimaranmi Jehová Diospa ‘ pakasqa yachayninmanta ’, arí, Diosqa yuyaykusqanman hina Mesiaspa Reinonwan pay sonqo runakunata qespichinqa sutintapas ch’uyanchanqa."
"How did Paul feel about the wisdom of the God who devised this purpose?" "¿Ima niranmi Pablo Diospa yachayninmanta?"
"The apostle concluded his letter with these words: “To God, wise alone, be the glory through Jesus Christ forever." "Paymi kay hinata tukuran carta qelqasqanta: “¡Pay sapallan yachayniyoq Diosta Jesucristoq ruwasqanrayku wiñay - wiñaypaq yupaychasun!"
"Amen. ” ​ — Romans 11: 25; 16: 25 - 27." "Amén ”, nispa."
"Paul understood that Jehovah is “wise alone ” ​ — the very pinnacle of wisdom in the universe." "Apóstol Pabloqa yacharanmi Jehová Dioslla “yachayniyoq ” kasqanta, paymi lliwmanta aswan yachayniyoqqa."
"What imperfect human could possibly think of a better way to handle anything ​ — let alone the most difficult challenge to divine wisdom ever made?" "¿Kanmanchu huchasapa runakunamanta pipas Diosmanta aswan yachayniyoq ima sasachakuytapas allichananpaq, Diospa kamachikuyninta Saqraq iskayachisqanta allichananpaqpas?"
"We need, then, to help people share the awe that we feel for the God who is “wise in heart. ”" "Chhayna kaqtinqa runamasinchismanmi yachachinanchis Dios manchakuyta, paymi ‘ hatun yachayniyoqqa ’ (Job 9: 4)."
"The better we comprehend Jehovah’s wisdom, the more fully we will trust that his way of handling matters is the best. ​ — Proverbs 3: 5, 6." "Jehová Dios ancha yachayniyoq kasqanta astawan reqsisun chayqa, astawanmi payman hap’ipakusun, paymi astawan yachan sasachakuykuna imayna allichayta (Proverbios 3: 5, 6)."
"Appreciating Jehovah’s Dominant Quality" "Jehová Diospa aswan sumaq kayninta chaniyoqpaq hap’isun"
"How can a greater understanding of Jehovah’s love help those who are troubled by God’s permission of suffering?" "Ima raykutaq Dios hinallata qhawan ñak’ariykunata nispa tapukuqkunata, ¿imaynata yanapasunman Jehová Diospa munakuyninta aswan allinta entiendenankupaq?"
"“God is love. ”" "Biblia nin: “Diosqa munakuymi ”, nispa."
"With those striking words, the Bible identifies Jehovah’s dominant quality, the quality that is the most appealing of them all and the most comforting for those troubled by the prevalence of wickedness." "Chaywanmi rikuchin Jehová Diospa sumaq kayninkunamanta, munakuynin aswan hatun aswan sumaq kasqanta, mana allinkunamanta llakikuqqa Diospa munakuyninpi sonqochasqa kanman."
"Jehovah has shown love in every aspect of the way he has handled sin’s terrible blight upon his creation." "Jehová Diosqa munakuyninta rikuchin huchata tukuchinanpaq imaymana ruwasqanpi."
"Love moved Jehovah to give hope to the sinful offspring of Adam and Eve, providing them with a means to approach Him and come into an approved relationship with Him." "Munakuyninpi Adán Evaq mirayninpaq sumaq suyakuyta qon, kicharantaqmi ñanta payman achhuykunankupaq sumaq qhawarisqan kanankupaqpas."
"Love moved God to provide a ransom that would open the way for full forgiveness of sins and restoration to perfect, everlasting life." "Munakuynillanpitaqmi kacharichiy sacrificiota qoran lliw runakuna huchankumanta panpachasqa kanankupaq, wiñay kawsayman ch’uya kawsaymanpas aypanankupaq."
"And love has moved him to be patient with mankind, giving as many as possible the opportunity to reject Satan and choose Jehovah as their Sovereign. ​ — 2 Peter 3: 9." "Chaymantapas munakuyninpin askha runakunaman tiempota qoshan Satanasmanta karunchakuspa paypa Kamachiyninta maskhanankupaq."
"We are blessed to have what insight, and what will we consider in the following article?" "¿Imamanta ñoqanchis allin saminchasqa kanchis? ¿Imamanta qatimuq estudiopi yachasun?"
"When one pastor addressed an audience gathered to mark the anniversary of a devastating terrorist attack, he said: “We don’t know the reason that God allows evil and suffering to continue. ”" "Huk llaqtapi terroristakuna runakunata wañuchisqanta yuyarishaqtinkun huk iglesiamanta umalliq, chaypi huñunasqa runakunaman niran: “Manan yachaykuchu ima rayku Dios hinallata qhawan mana allinkuna ñak’ariykuna kanantapas ”, nispa."

"Are we not blessed to have insight into this subject?" "Ñoqanchismi ichaqa chay tapuykunaq kutichiyninta yachanchis (Deuteronomio 29: 29)."
"And since Jehovah is wise, just, and loving, we know that he will soon end all suffering." "Jehová Diosqa chaninmi, yachayniyoqmi, munakuqmi, chaymi yachanchis pisi tiempollamanta lliw ñak’ariykuna tukuchinanta."
"In fact, he has promised to do so." "Hinaspapas prometeranñan tukuchinanta."

No. Manan.
"Love has moved him to provide for them as well, by means of the resurrection." "Jehová Diosqa munakuyninpin wañuqkunapaqpas kawsarinpuy suyakuyta qon."
"That will be the subject of the following article." "Chaymanta rimanqa qatimuq estudio."

"• Why should we help people to come to a greater understanding of Jehovah’s love? [Picture on page 21]" "• ¿Ima rayku runakunata yanapananchis Jehová Diospa munakuyninmanta aswan allinta yachanankupaq?"

"However, many dishonest people cheat on their taxes." "Ichaqa askha runakunan q’otuspanku impuestota mana pagankuchu."
"Death seems far more certain. On our own, none of us can avoid it in the long run." "Wañuymantan ichaqa mana pipas ayqenchu, tiempowanqa lliwmi wañunchis."
"It pursues us all. With an insatiable hunger, Sheol ​ — the common grave of mankind — ​ devours people dear to us." "Sheol otaq wañuypacha nisqaqa llapa wañupuqkunaq kasqanmi, Sheolqa mana saksaspan munakusqanchis runakunata oqoykapun (Proverbios 27: 20)."
"But consider a comforting thought." "Kanmi ichaqa suyakuy."
"2, 3. (a) Why is death less certain than many realize?" "2, 3. (a) ¿Ima rayku ninchis wakinqa manan wañunqakuchu nispa?"
"(b) What will we consider in this article?" "(b) ¿Imamantan kay estudiopi yachasunchis?"
"Jehovah’s Word gives the sure hope of the resurrection, of being raised to life once again." "Diospa Simin qelqan kawsarinpuy suyakuyta qowanchis."
"This is no mere dream, and no force in the universe can prevent Jehovah from making this hope a reality." "Chayqa manan yanqa suyakuyllachu, Jehová Dios hunt’anantaqa manan pipas ni imapas hark’anqachu."
"For some, though, death is less certain than many today realize." "Kunan tiempopi wakin kawsaqkunaqa manañan wañunqakuchu."
Why? "¿Ima rayku chayta ninchis?"
"Because an unnumbered “great crowd ” will survive“ the great tribulation, ” soon to come." "Biblian willawanchis ‘ ancha askha runakuna ’ sispaykamuq “manchay ñak’ariymanta ” qespichisqa kanankuta."
"They will live on afterward, with eternity in view." "Chay manchay ñak’ariymanta qespiqkunaqa wiñay kawsay ñanpiñan tarikunqaku."
"Thus, death is no certainty for them." "Arí, paykunamanqa manapaschá wañuyqa aypanqachu."
"Moreover, “death is to be brought to nothing. ” ​ — 1 Corinthians 15: 26." "Hinaspapas wañuyqa ‘ ch’usaqyachisqan ’ kanqa."
"We need to feel as certain of the resurrection as did the apostle Paul, who said: “There is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. ”" "Ñoqanchispas apóstol Pablo hina manan iskayananchischu kawsarinpuy suyakuymanta, paymi niran: ‘ Chaninkunatapas mana chaninkunatapas wañusqankumanta Dios kawsarichinpunqa ’, nispa."
"Let us consider three questions regarding the resurrection." "Kawsarinpuymanta rimaq kinsa tapuykunata kay estudiopi kutichisunchis."
"First, what makes this hope so certain?" "Huknin kaq, ¿imakunan rikuchin kawsarinpuy suyakuyninchis cheqaq kasqanta?"
"Second, how can you personally take comfort in the resurrection hope?" "Iskay kaq, ¿imaynatan kawsarinpuy suyakuy sapankanchista sonqochawanchis?"
"Third, how may this hope affect the way you live right now?" "Kinsa kaq, ¿imaynata kawsarinpuy suyakuy kawsayninchispi yanapawanchis?"
"The Resurrection ​ — A Certainty" "Kawsarinpuy suyakuyninchisqa cheqaqpunin"
"How is the resurrection central to Jehovah’s purpose?" "¿Imaynapin kawsarinpuy suyakuy Jehová Diospa munayninpi tarikun?"
"There are a number of factors that make the resurrection a certainty." "Askhan sut’inchan kawsarinpuy suyakuyninchis cheqaq kasqanta."
"Above all, it is central to Jehovah’s purpose." "Ñawpaq kaqqa kaymi, Jehová Diospa munayninpi tarikun."
"Remember, Satan led mankind into sin, with its inevitable consequence, death." "Yachasqanchis hina Satanasmi runata huchaman urmachiran, chay raykun llapallanchis wañuyman qaraykusqa karanchis."
"Thus, Jesus said of Satan: “That one was a manslayer when he began. ”" "Chay raykun Jesusqa Saqramanta niran: “Payqa qallariymantapachan runa wañuchiq karqan ”, nispa."
"But Jehovah promised that his “woman, ” or wifelike organization in heaven, would produce a“ seed ” who would bruise that “original serpent ” in the head, crushing Satan out of existence." "Jehová Diosmi ichaqa prometeran hanaq pacha llaqtan ‘ warminman ’ rikch’anachisqa hina mirayniyoq kananta, chay miraymi ‘ ñawpa mach’aqwayta ’ umanpi sarunqa, chaywanqa nisharan Satanás wañuchinanta (Génesis 3: 1 - 6, 15; Apocalipsis 12: 9, 10; 20: 10)."
"As Jehovah gradually revealed his purpose involving that Messianic Seed, it became apparent that the Seed would do more than destroy Satan." "Chay mirayqa manan Satanasllatachu wañuchinqa, chay yuyaykusqanta Jehová Diosqa pisi pisimanta sut’ita rikuchiran."
"God’s Word says: “For this purpose the Son of God was made manifest, namely, to break up the works of the Devil. ”" "Biblian nin: “Diospa Churinqa hamurqan saqraq ruwasqankunata thuninanpaqpunin ”, nispa."
"Death caused by the sin we inherited from Adam is chief among Satan’s works that Jehovah purposes to see undone, or broken up, through Jesus Christ." "Adanpa huchanmanta wañuy paqarisqantan Jehová Diosqa chinkachiytapuni munan Churin Jesucristowan."
"In this regard, Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice and the resurrection are vitally important. ​ — Acts 2: 22 - 24; Romans 6: 23." "Chaypaqmi necesitakun kacharichiy sacrificiota kawsarinpuy kanantapas."
"Why will the resurrection glorify Jehovah’s name?" "¿Imaynatan Jehová Dios kawsarinpuywan sutinta hatunchanqa?"
"Jehovah is determined to glorify his sacred name." "Jehová Diosqa munanpunin sutin hatunchasqa kananta."
"Satan has maligned God’s name and has promoted lies." "Saqraqa Diospa sutintan qhellicharan Diosmanta mana kaqta rimaspa."
"He lyingly said that Adam and Eve ‘ positively would not die ’ if they partook of the fruit forbidden by God." "Llullakuspan Adán Evata niran, sach’aq rurunta mikhuspaqa manan wañunkichischu, nispa (Génesis 2: 16, 17; 3: 4)."
"Ever since, Satan has fostered similar lies, such as the false teaching that a soul survives the death of the body." "Kunankamapas Saqraqa llullakushallanmi, kay hina yachachiyta mast’arispa: wañuqkunaq almanqa kawsashallanmi, nispa."
"However, by means of the resurrection, Jehovah will expose all such lies for what they are." "Kawsarinpuywanmi Jehová Diosqa Saqraq llullakusqanta sut’iman horqonqa."
"He will establish for all time that he alone is the Preserver and Restorer of life." "Chaywanmi rikuchinqa paylla runaq kawsayninta waqaychaqpas wakmanta kawsarichiqpas kasqanta."
"6, 7." "6, 7."
"How does Jehovah feel about resurrecting people, and how do we know of his feelings?" "¿Imaynatan Dios qhawarin wañuqkuna kawsarichiyta, imaynapi chayta yachanchis?"
"Jehovah yearns to carry out the resurrection." "Jehová Diosqa munanpunin wañupuqkuna kawsarichiyta."
"The Bible makes clear Jehovah’s feelings in this regard." "Biblian sut’ita willawanchis kawsarichiyta Dios imayna qhawarisqanta."
"For instance, consider these inspired words of the faithful man Job: “If an able - bodied man dies can he live again?" "Khaynatan Job niran: “Runari, ¿wañuspa kawsarinñachu?"
"All the days of my compulsory service I shall wait, until my relief comes." "Ñoqaqa suyakusaqmi muchusqay p’unchaykuna tukukunankama, suyallasaqpunin kacharisqa kanay p’unchaykama."
"You will call, and I myself shall answer you. For the work of your hands you will have a yearning. ”" "Waqyamuwaqtiykiqa kutichimusqaykin, kamasqayki runamanta sonqoykita ‘ ch’allaq ’ nirichinki ”, nispa (Job 14: 14, 15)."
"What do those words mean?" "¿Imatan chaywan nisharan?"
"Job knew that after he died, a time of waiting in the sleep of death lay ahead of him. He viewed that time as “compulsory service, ” an enforced period of waiting for release." "Jobqa yacharanmi wañupuspa huk tiempo wañuypi puñunanta, chaytan qhawariran ‘ muchuy p’unchaykunata ’ hina, chaymanta kacharichisqa kanankama."
"To him, that release was a certainty." "Paypaqqa chay kacharichiyqa otaq kawsarinpuyqa cheqaqpunin karan."
"Job realized that his relief would come. Why?" "¿Ima rayku chay hinata yuyaykuran?"
"Because he knew of Jehovah’s feelings. Jehovah would “have a yearning ” to see his faithful servant again." "Jehová Diosqa sonqontaraqmi ‘ ch’allaq nichin ’ wakmanta hunt’aq siervonta kawsarichinanpaq, chaytan Jobqa yacharan."
"Yes, God longs to bring back to life all righteous individuals." "Arí, Jehová Diosqa munanmi chanin runakunata kawsarichiyta."
"Jehovah will also give others an opportunity to live forever in Paradise on earth." "Huk runakunamanpas qollanqataqmi paraisopi wiñay kawsanankupaq suyakuyta."
"Since it is God’s will to carry out that purpose, who can stop him?" "¿Pitaq Diosta hark’anman chay yuyaykusqanta hunt’ananpaq?"
"How has Jehovah “furnished a guarantee ” of our hope for the future?" "¿Imata ruwaspan Jehová Dios kawsarinpuy suyakuyta cheqaqcharan?"
"Our hope for the future is guaranteed by the resurrection of Jesus." "Kawsariymanta suyakuyninchisqa Jesuspa kawsarisqanpin saphichasqa kashan."
"When Paul gave a speech in Athens, he declared: “[God] has set a day in which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and he has furnished a guarantee to all men in that he has resurrected him from the dead. ”" "Atenas llaqtapi runakunaman yachachispanmi apóstol Pablo niran: “Diosqa huk p’unchaytan churanña, chay p’unchaypin akllasqan Jesuswan kay pachapi tiyaqkunata chaninninpi juzganqa."
"Some in Paul’s audience mocked when they heard of a resurrection. A few, however, became believers." "Chay hina kasqantaqa lliw runamanmi reqsichin, wañusqanmanta payta kawsarichimpuspan ”, nispa."
"Perhaps the thought that this hope is guaranteed caught their attention." "Pabloq yachachisqanta uyarispan wakin runakuna asikuranku, wakintaqmi ichaqa iñiranku, ¿ima rayku?"
"When Jehovah resurrected Jesus, He performed the greatest of miracles." "Chay yachachiynin allin suyakuypi saphichasqa kasqan rayku."
"He brought his Son forth from death to life as a mighty spirit." "Jesusta kawsarichispan Jehová Diosqa aswan hatun milagrota ruwaran, wañuymanta kacharichispan Churinman wakmanta kawsayta qoran atiyniyoq espiritupi."
"The resurrected Jesus was even greater than he had been during his prehuman existence." "Kawsarichisqa kasqan qhepamanmi Jesusqa aswan atiyniyoq kapuran manaraq Allpaman hamushasqanmantaqa."
"Immortal and second only to Jehovah in power, Jesus is now in a position to take on wonderful assignments from his Father." "Payqa mana wañuqñan ancha atiyniyoqtaq kapunpas, Jehová Diosllan paymantaqa aswan atiyniyoq, chaymi Taytanpa ima kamachisqantapas hunt’anqapuni."
"Jesus is the means by which Jehovah performs all other resurrections ​ — to life in heaven or to life on earth." "Jehová Diosqa Jesuswanmi kawsariypaq kaqkunata kawsarichin: hanaq pachapaq kaqkunatapas kay pachapaq kaqkunatapas."
"Jesus himself said: “I am the resurrection and the life. ”" "Jesuspunin niran: “Ñoqan kawsarimpuypas kawsaypas kani ”, nispa."
"By resurrecting his Son, Jehovah guaranteed such hopes for all faithful ones." "Arí, Churinta kawsarichispanmi Jehová Diosqa lliw kamachinkunaman kawsariymanta suyakuyta cheqaqcharan."
"How does the Bible record establish the reality of the resurrection?" "¿Imaynatan Biblia sut’inchan kawsarinpuy suyakuyninchis cheqaq kasqanta?"
"The resurrection has been demonstrated before eyewitnesses and recorded in God’s Word." "Kawsarinpuykunaqa runaq rikusqanmi ruwakuran Bibliapitaq qelqasqa kashan."
"The Bible record contains detailed descriptions of eight resurrections of people brought back to life as humans on earth. These miracles were performed not in secret but openly, often in front of eyewitnesses." "Bibliapi willakun pusaq runakuna kay Allpapi kawsashanallankupaq kawsarichisqa kasqankumanta, chay milagrokunataqa manan pakapichu ruwakuran aswanpas lliwpa rikusqanmi."
"Jesus resurrected Lazarus, who had been dead for four days, in front of a crowd of mourners ​ — no doubt including the man’s family, friends, and neighbors." "Jesusmi Lazarota kawsarichiran tawa p’unchay wañusqan qhepataña, chaypin kasharanku familiankuna, amigonkuna, llaqtamasin runakunapas."
"This evidence that Jesus was sent by God was so forceful that Jesus ’ religious enemies never denied that it had happened." "Chay milagro ruwasqantaqa awqankunapas manan negarankuchu, aswanmi chay hawa Jesusta Lazarotapas wañuchiyta munaranku."
"Instead, they plotted to kill not only Jesus but also Lazarus!" "Arí, kawsarinpuymanta suyakuyninchisqa cheqaqpunin."
"Yes, we can have confidence that the resurrection is a certainty. God has given us a record of past resurrections in order to comfort us and to build up our faith." "Jehová Diosqa Simin Qelqapin qelqachiran kawsarinpuymanta milagrokunata chay hinapi sonqochawananchispaq iñiyninchistapas kallpachananpaq."
"Finding Comfort in the Resurrection Hope" "Kawsarinpuy suyakuypi sonqochayta tarisun"
"What will help us to draw comfort from the Bible’s resurrection accounts?" "¿Imata ruwananchis kawsarinpuykunamanta Bibliaq willasqanwan sonqochasqa kanapaq?"
"Do you long for comfort in the face of death?" "Wañuy patapiña tarikushanchis chayqa, munanchispunin sonqochasqa kayta."
"One sure source of comfort can be found in the Bible’s resurrection accounts." "Bibliaq kawsariykunamanta willasqanmi sonqochawasun."
"Reading such accounts, meditating on them, and visualizing the events can make the resurrection hope more real to you." "Kawsarichisqa runakunamanta leesqanchismi, yuyaymanasqanchismi yanapawasun kawsarinpuy suyakuypi allinta hap’ipakunanchispaq."
"These are not just stories." "Manan yanqa willaykunallachu."
"They actually happened to real people like us, living at a real time and in a real place." "Chay kawsarichisqa runakunaqa cheqaqtapuni kawsaranku, ñawpaq tiempopin tiyaranku, llaqtayoqtaq karankupas."
"Let us focus briefly on one example ​ — the first resurrection in the Bible record." "Pisillapi qhawarisun ñawpaq kaq kawsarichiymanta Bibliaq willasqanta."
"11, 12. (a) What tragedy befell the widow of Zarephath, and how did she respond at first?" "11, 12. (a) ¿Ima hatun llakipin tarikuran Sarepta llaqtamanta viuda, pimantaq tunparan chhaynapi tarikusqanmanta?"
"(b) Describe what Jehovah empowered his prophet Elijah to do for the widow." "(b) ¿Imatan Jehová Dios ruwaran viudata sonqochananpaq?"
"Picture the scene." "Qhawarisun imayna kasqanta."
"For some weeks, the prophet Elijah has been a guest of the widow of Zarephath, living in a chamber on her roof." "Profeta Eliasmi semanakunaña Sarepta llaqtamanta viudaq wasinpi qorpachakushan."
"It is a dark era." "Chay p’unchaykunaqa sasa p’unchaykunan kashan."
"The region is stricken by drought and famine." "Chay llaqtakunapin sinchita usarishan, chaymi yarqaypas sinchita mast’arikushan."
"Many are dying." "Askhan wañushanku."
"Jehovah has already used Elijah to perform a prolonged miracle to reward the faith of this humble widow." "Jehová Diosmi ichaqa profetan Eliaswan yanapashan huk viuda warmita."
"She and her young son were on the brink of starvation, down to their last meal, when God empowered Elijah to perform a miracle so that her supply of flour and oil was miraculously sustained." "Viudapas wawanpas yarqaypi tarikusqanku raykun kallpanku pisiyapusqa; hak’unkupas aceitenkupas huk mikhuyllapaqña kashaqtinmi Jehová Dios profeta Eliasman atiyta qoran huk milagrota ruwananpaq, chhaynapi viudaq hak’unpas aceitenpas mana tukukuranchu."
"Now, though, tragedy befalls her." "Chay qhepamanmi viudaqa wakmanta hatun llakipi tarikuran."
"Illness suddenly strikes the child, and soon he stops breathing." "Wawanmi onqospa wañupusqa."
"How devastated the widow is!" "Warmiqa manan imanakuytapas atiranchu."
"It is bad enough to live without the strength and support of a husband, but now she has lost her only child." "Kunanqa rikukuran mana qosayoq mana wawayoq ima."
"In her grief, she even blames Elijah and his God, Jehovah!" "Chhayna llakipi tarikuspan Eliasta Jehová Diostapas huchacharan."
"What will the prophet do?" "¿Imatan profeta Elías ruwaran?"
"Elijah does not reprove the widow for her false accusation. Instead, he says: “Give me your son. ”" "Profeta Eliasqa manan chaymanta phiñakuranchu, aswanmi warmita niran “apamuy churiykita ”, nispa."
"After carrying the dead child to the roof chamber, Elijah prays repeatedly for the child’s life to be returned." "Wawata marq’arikuspan qorpachakusqan cuartoman seqaran, chaypitaq Diosmanta askha kutita mañakuran wawata kawsarichinanpaq."
"Finally, Jehovah acts!" "Jehová Diostaq uyariran mañakusqanta."
"Imagine the joy spreading over Elijah’s face as he sees the boy’s chest heave with the intake of air." "Eliasqa muspharanraqchá wakmanta wawa samayta qallariqtin ñawinpas kicharikuqtin."
"The child’s eyelids open, and his eyes glisten with life. Elijah brings the boy down to his mother and says: “See, your son is alive. ”" "Chay qhepamantaq Eliasqa wawata mamanman qoykapuran kay hinata nispa: “Kayqa wawayki, kawsashanmi ”, nispa."
"Her joy is beyond description. She says: “Now, indeed, I do know that you are a man of God and that Jehovah’s word in your mouth is true. ”" "Viudaqa imaynataraqchá kusikuran, chaymi khaynata niran: “Kunanqa cheqaqtapunin yachani Dios sonqo runa kasqaykita, Señor Diospa simin rimasqaykipas cheqaqpuni kasqanta ”, nispa (1 Reyes 17: 8 - 24)."
"Her faith in Jehovah and in his representative is stronger than ever." "Chay qhepamanmi warmiqa astawan iñin Jehová Diospi kamachisqan runapipas."
"Why does the account about Elijah resurrecting a widow’s son bring comfort to us today?" "Viudaq wawan kawsarichisqa kasqanmanta yachay, ¿ima rayku sonqochawanchis?"
"Meditating on such an account surely brings you great comfort." "Jehová Dios viudapaq ruwasqanpi yuyaymanayqa sonqochawanchismi."
"How clear it is that Jehovah is able to defeat our enemy death!" "Chaywanmi sut’itapuni yachanchis Jehová Dios awqanchis wañuy chinkachinanta."
"Just imagine the day when that widow’s joy is multiplied thousands of times over in the general resurrection of the dead!" "Imaynaraqchá kanqa Allpantinpi wañuqkunata kawsarichinanpaq Churinta kamachiqtin."
"The joy in heaven will also be great as Jehovah delights in directing his Son to carry out resurrections on a global scale." "Millonninpi runakunachá viuda hinaraq kusikunqaku, hanaq pachapi kaqkunapas anchatachá kusikunqaku."
"Has death taken someone dear to you?" "¿Familiaykimanta mayqellanpas wañupuranchu?"
"How wonderful it is to know that Jehovah can and will restore the dead to life!" "Jehová Dios wañuqkuna kawsarichinanmanta yachayqa, ¡anchatan kusichiwanchis!"
"Your Hope and Your Life Now" "Kawsarinpuy suyakuy kawsayninchispi yanapawanchis"
"How can the resurrection hope affect your life?" "¿Imaynatan kawsarinpuy suyakuy kawsayninchispi yanapawanchis?"
"How can the resurrection hope affect the way you live right now?" "¿Imaynatan kawsarinpuy suyakuy kawsayninchispi yanapawanchis?"
"You can draw strength from this hope when facing hardships, challenges, persecution, or danger." "Kallpachawasunmanmi ñak’ariykunata, sasachakuykunata, qatiykachaykunatapas aguantananchispaq."
"Satan wants you to be so terrified of death that you would willingly barter your integrity for some hollow promise of safety." "Satanasqa munanmi wañuyta manchakuspa Jehová Diospaq hunt’aq kasqaykita yanqa allin kawsay promesakunawan cambianaykita."
"Remember that Satan said to Jehovah: “Everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. ”" "Yachasqanchis hina Saqran Jehová Diosta niran: “Qhali kashaspaqa, tukuy imantapas runaqa qoyta atinmi, kawsayninta qespichinanraykuqa ”, nispa (Job 2: 4)."
"In making such a statement, Satan maligned all of us, including you." "Chhaynata nispaqa lliw runatan tunpasharan, qantapas tunpashasunkin."
"Is it true that you will quit serving God if you face danger?" "¿Cheqaqtapunichu Diosta saqewaq sinchi sasachakuypi tarikuspa?"
"By contemplating the hope of the resurrection, you can make firm your determination to keep on doing the will of your heavenly Father." "Sichus kawsarinpuy suyakuypi yuyaymananki chayqa, tukuy sonqowanmi Jehová Diospa munayninta ruwashallanki."
"How might Jesus ’ words recorded at Matthew 10: 28 bring us comfort in the face of danger?" "Mateo 10: 28 textopi Jesuspa nisqan, ¿imaynatan sonqochawasunman sasachakuykunapi tarikuqtinchis?"
"Jesus said: “Do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. ” We need not be in dread of Satan or his human agents." "Jesusmi niran: “Ama cuerpoykichis wañuchiqkunataqa manchakuychischu, manan almaykichistaqa wañuchinqakuchu, aswanpas manchakuychisqa Diosta, paymi almata cuerpotawan infiernoman [Gehena] wikch’uykunanpaq atiyniyoqqa ”, nispa."
"True, some may have the power to cause harm, even death." "Manan ima raykupas manchakunachu Satanasta yanapaqnin runakunatapas."
"However, the worst they can do is still only temporary." "Yaqapaschá wakinpaqa kan atiynin ñak’arichiwananchispaq wañuchiwananchispaqpas, chhaynaña kaqtinpas chay ruwasqankuqa manan wiñaypaqchu."
"Jehovah can and will undo any damage done to his faithful servants, even resurrecting them." "Jehová Diosmi lliw kamachinkunaq ñak’ariyninkunata chinkachinqa, wañuqtinkupas kawsarichinqa."
"It is Jehovah alone who is worthy of our fear, our profound awe and respect." "Payllatan manchakunanchis, yupaychananchis, anchatapas respetananchis."
"He alone has the power to take away life and all prospects for future life, destroying both body and soul in Gehenna." "Payllan atiyniyoq kunan kawsayninchista wiñay kawsay suyakuyninchistapas chinkachinanpaq, cuerponchista almanchistawan Gehenapi wañuchispa."
"Happily, Jehovah does not want that to happen to you." "Jehová Diosmi ichaqa mana munanchu chhaynapi tukunanchista."
"Because of the resurrection hope, we as God’s servants can always be sure that we are safe." "Kawsarinpuymanta suyakuywanmi Diospa kamachinkunaqa mana manchakuspa kawsanchis."
"Everlasting life lies ahead of us as long as we are faithful, and there is nothing that Satan or his minions can do about that. ​ — Psalm 118: 6; Hebrews 13: 6." "Wiñay kawsaymi suyashan Diosta hunt’a sonqowan serviqkunaman, manan Satanaspas nitaq yanapaqninkunapas chaymantaqa hark’anmanchu (Salmo 118: 6; Hebreos 13: 6)."
"How does our viewpoint affect the priorities that we set?" "¿Imaynatan kawsarinpuymanta suyakuy kawsayninchispi yanapawanchis?"
"If the resurrection hope is real to us, it can shape our attitude about life." "Sichus kawsarinpuymanta suyakuyninchispi mana iskayanchischu chayqa, kawsayninchismi Diospaq hina kanqa."
"We realize that ‘ whether we live or we die, we belong to Jehovah. ’" "‘ Kawsaspapas wañuspapas Señorpaqñan kasunchis ’."
"In setting priorities, we therefore apply Paul’s counsel: “Quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. ”" "Hinaspapas apóstol Pabloq nisqanta kawsayninchispi churasun: “Amaña runakunaq imaynatachus kawsashasqanta hinaqa kawsaychischu, aswanpas mosoqyachisqa yuyayniykichisman tupaqtapuni kawsaychis. Ahinapin mayqenchus Diospa munaynin kasqanta reparankichis, paypa munayninqa allinmi, sumaqmi, hunt’asqapunin ”, nispa."
"Many people are in a frantic rush to gratify every desire, every ambition, every impulse." "Askha runakunan kawsayninkupi sinchitapuni ima munasqankuta maskhanku."
"Because they view life as being short, they seem almost desperate in their pursuit of pleasure, and if they have a form of worship, it certainly does not harmonize with the “perfect will of God. ”" "Paykunaqa yuyanku kawsayninku pisi tiempolla kananta, chaymi ima hinaraq q’ochukuykunata maskhanku, religionniyoqña kanku chaypas kawsayninkuqa manan Diospa ‘ munayninwan ’ tupanchu."
"17, 18. (a) How does Jehovah’s Word acknowledge the shortness of human life, but what does God want for us?" "17, 18. (a) ¿Imaynatan Biblia sut’inchan kawsayninchis pisi watakunalla kasqanta, ichaqa imatan Dios munan ñoqanchispaq?"
"(b) Why are we moved to praise Jehovah daily?" "(b) ¿Iman kallpachawanchis sapa p’unchay Jehová Diosta yupaychashanallanchispaq?"
"True, life is short." "Arí, kawsayninchisqa pisillan."
"“It must quickly pass by, and away we fly, ” perhaps in some 70 or 80 years." "‘ Usqhayllan watakuna ripun, ñoqanchispas chinkapunchis. ’"
"Humans come and go like green grass, like a passing shadow, like an exhalation." "Qanchis chunka otaq pusaq chunka watakunallan kawsanchis (Salmo 90: 10)."
"But God did not purpose that we spend a few decades growing up and gaining some wisdom and experience, only to spend the next few decades breaking down and descending into illness and death." "Jehová Diosmi ichaqa mana munaranchu pisi watakunalla kawsayninchispi yachayta ima ruway munasqanchistapas tarinanchista chay qhepamantaq onqospa machuyaspa wañunanchista."
"Jehovah created humans with the desire to live forever." "Aswanmi Jehová Diosqa runata kamaran wiñay kawsay yuyaywan."
"“Time indefinite he has put in their heart, ” the Bible tells us." "Biblia nin: ‘ Runamanqa qoykurqanmi wiñay - wiñay kaqpi yuyaykuyta [otaq wiñay kawsaypi] ’ (Eclesiastés 3: 11)."
"Is God cruel, giving us such a desire and then making it impossible to fulfill it?" "¿Chhayna yuyaywan kamawashaspanchischu ñak’arichiwasunman mana chay hinata kawsachiwaspanchis?"
"No, indeed, for “God is love. ”" "Manapunin, Biblian Diosmanta nin: payqa “munakuymi ”, nispa."
"He will use the resurrection to make everlasting life possible for people who have died." "Payqa wañuqkunamanpas qonqa wiñay kawsayta wañusqankumanta kawsarichispa."
"Thanks to the resurrection hope, we can have a secure future." "Kawsarinpuy suyakuywanmi hamuq tiempopi kawsayninchismanta mana iskayanchischu."
"We need not be frantic, driven to reach our full potential right now." "Chaymi kunan kawsayninchispiqa manan sinchitachu kallpachakunanchis ima munasqanchiskunata aypananchispaq."

"(b) What do the Scriptures promise with regard to the effects of Adamic sin?" "b) Bibliaq nisqan hina, ¿iman sucedenqa Adanpa huchallikusqanmanta ñak’ariykunawan?"

"If so, it is important to bear in mind that the description found in Ecclesiastes chapter 12 portrays aging, not as what the Creator, Jehovah God, originally intended, but as the consequence of Adamic sin on the human body. ​ — Romans 5: 12." "Jehová Diosqa manan munaranchu chay textopi nisqan hina machuyaspa muchunanchista, runakunaqa Adanpa huchallikusqanmantan machuyashanchis."
"Aging in itself is not a curse, for continued existence requires the passing of years." "Watakunaq pasasqanqa manan ñakapakunapaqchu, aswanmi llapa kawsaqkuna wiñanankupaq poqonankupaqwan tiempoq pasananta munanchis."
"In fact, growth and maturity are desirable characteristics of all living things." "Runakunaq soqta waranqa watapi huchawan muchusqanqa as pisimanmi qonqasqa kapunqa."
"The ravages of six thousand years of sin and imperfection that we see around us will soon be a thing of the past, and all obedient humans will enjoy life as it was intended, without the pain of old age and death." "Jehová Diosta kasukuq runakunan qallariypi Diospa munasqanman hina kawsanqaku, manan ñak’arinqakuñachu machuyaywan wañuywanpas (Génesis 1: 28; Apocalipsis 21: 4, 5)."

"How did aged prophetess Anna show her devotion to God, and how was she rewarded?" "¿Imaynatan profetisa Ana Dios sonqo kayninta rikuchiran, imaynatan Jehová Dios samincharan?"
"Consider the first - century prophetess Anna." "Ana sutiyoq profetisapi yuyaykuy."
"At 84 years of age, she was “never missing from the temple, rendering sacred service night and day with fastings and supplications. ”" "Pusaq chunka tawayoq watanpin ‘ Dios yupaychana wasimanta mana lloqsiqchu, [otaq yupaychana wasita rillaqpuni] tuta - p’unchaymi ayunaspa mañakuspa Diosta yupaychaq ’."
"As a woman whose father was a non - Levite “of Asher’s tribe, ” Anna could not literally live at the temple." "Payqa manan Leví ayllumantachu karan, aswanmi “Aser ayllumanta ”, chaymi mana yupaychana wasipichu tiyaran."
"Imagine what it must have taken for her to be at the temple daily from the time of the morning service to the time of the evening service!" "Anchatan kallpachakuran tutamanta ofrenda haywasqankumantapacha rasphiyaykuyta ofrenda haywasqankukama yupaychana wasipi qhepakunanpaq."
"For her devotion, however, Anna was richly rewarded. She was privileged to be on hand when Joseph and Mary brought the infant Jesus to the temple to be presented to Jehovah according to the Law." "Dios sonqo kasqanmantan saminchasqa karan, huk p’unchaymi Josewan Mariawan Kamachikuy Simipi nisqanman hina yupaychana wasiman Jesús wawata apaqtinku Ana chaypi kasharan."
"At the sight of Jesus, Anna “began returning thanks to God and speaking about the child to all those waiting for Jerusalem’s deliverance. ” ​ — Luke 2: 22 - 24, 36 - 38; Numbers 18: 6, 7." "Jesusta rikuspan “Diosman graciasta qorqan, Jesús wawamantataq rimarirqan llapallan Jerusalén llaqtaq kacharichisqa kayninta suyakushaqkunaman ”."
"5, 6." "5, 6."
"In what ways are many aged ones today manifesting a spirit like that of Anna?" "¿Imakunapin askha yuyaq wayqe panakuna Anaman rikch’akunku?"
"Many aged ones among us today are like Anna in their regular meeting attendance, their earnest supplication for the advancement of true worship, and their irrepressible desire to preach the good news."

"During his advanced years, how did Moses express his desire to grow in his relationship with God?" "Yuyaqña kashaspapas, ¿ima niranmi Moisés Jehová Dioswan astawan hukllachakuy munasqanmanta?"
"Experience in life comes with the passing of time." "Runakunaqa watakunaq pasasqanman hinan astawan yachanku (Job 12: 12)."
"Spiritual advancement, on the other hand, does not come automatically with age." "Espiritualpi wiñanapaqmi ichaqa mana watakunallachu pasanan."
"Therefore, rather than merely relying on a reserve of knowledge acquired in the past, loyal servants of God strive to “increase in learning ” as the years go by." "Diospa hunt’aq kamachinkunapas manan ñawpaqpi yachasqallankuwanchu kusisqa kanku, aswanmi kallpachakunku astawan ‘ yachaysapa kanankupaq ’ (Proverbios 9: 9)."
"When Jehovah commissioned him, Moses was 80 years old." "Moisestapas pusaq chunka watanpi kashaqtinmi Jehová Dios kamachiran llaqtanta kacharichimunanpaq (Éxodo 7: 7)."
"By his day, living to that age was evidently considered unusual, for he wrote: “In themselves the days of our years are seventy years; and... because of special mightiness they are eighty years. ”" "Moisespa tiemponpiqa huk iskay runakunallan pusaq chunka wataman chayaqku, chaymi payqa kayta qelqaran: “Qanchis chunka watallan kawsayku, kallpasapakunataq pusaq chunkakama chayayku ”, nispa (Salmo 90: 10)."
"Still, Moses never felt that he was too old to learn." "Moisesqa manan hayk’aqpas niranchu, machuñan kani yachanaypaq, nispa."
"After decades of serving God, enjoying many privileges, and carrying weighty responsibilities, Moses pleaded with Jehovah: “Make me know, please, your ways, that I may know you. ”" "Payqa askha watakunan Jehová Diospa munayninta ruwaran, askha saminchaykunatan chaskikuran, sasa kamachikuykunatan hunt’aranpas, chaykunata ruwasqan qhepamanmi Jehová Diosta valekuran: ‘ Yuyaykusqaykikunata yachachiway, qanta reqsinaypaq ’, nispa (Éxodo 33: 13)."

"How did Daniel keep his mind active into his 90 ’ s, and with what results?" "Isqon chunka watanpi hinaña kasharan chaypas, ¿imatan profeta Daniel ruwashallaran, iman karan chhayna ruwasqanmanta?"
"The prophet Daniel, likely in his 90 ’ s, could still be found poring over the holy writings." "Profeta Danielpas isqon chunka watanpi hinaña kasharan chaypas, t’aqwishallaranmi Diospa Simin Qelqakunata."
"What he discerned through his study of “the books ” ​ — possibly including Leviticus, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, and Amos — ​ moved him to seek Jehovah in fervent prayer." "T’aqwisqan ‘ qelqakunapi ’ yachasqanmi (yaqapaschá Levítico, Isaías, Jeremías, Oseas, Amós librokunatawan t’aqwiran) kallpacharan tukuy sonqowan Jehová Diosmanta mañakunanpaq (Daniel 9: 1, 2)."

"Similarly, Fred, who has spent more than 60 years in the full - time ministry, finds it spiritually stimulating to initiate Bible discussions with fellow believers." "Fred sutiyoq cristianopas soqta chunka wata hinañan Diospa munayninta ruwaspa tukuy tiemponwan llank’ashan, cristianomasinkunawan Bibliamanta rimaspataq anchata kallpachakun."
"“I have to keep the Bible alive in my mind, ” he says." "Paymi nin: “Bibliamanta yachasqaytan umallaypi hap’inay."
"“If you can make the Bible live ​ — make it meaningful — ​ and if you can fit what you are learning into ‘ the pattern of healthful words, ’ then you don’t just have isolated pieces of information."

"Being advanced in age does not necessarily preclude the learning of new and difficult concepts." "Yuyaqkunaqa yachallankumanmi sasa yachaykunata mosoq yachaykunatapas."

"Why consider the accomplishments of faithful older ones?" "¿Ima rayku yuyaq wayqe panakunaq ruwasqanmanta yachashanchis?"

"Why, then, consider what some older ones have accomplished?" "Chhaynaqa ¿ima raykutaq yuyaq wayqe panakunaq ruwasqanmanta yachashanchis?"
"It is certainly not to suggest that all should strive to achieve the same things." "Chaywanqa manan nishanchischu, llapa yuyaqkunan chayta ruwananku nispaqa."
"Rather, it is in the spirit of what the apostle Paul wrote to the Hebrew Christians concerning faithful congregation elders: “As you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith. ”" "Apóstol Pablon Dios sonqo umalliqkunamanta rimaspa hebreo cristianokunaman kayta qelqaran: “Imaynatachus kawsasqankuta yachaqakuychis, iñiyninkutapas qatichikullaychistaq ” nispa, chayta ruwanapaqmi kaypi kallpachawashanchis."

"Devoted Despite Changing Circumstances" "Hunt’aq runakunan kanku imaynapiña tarikuspapas"
"12, 13." "12, 13."
"How did Barzillai display godly devotion despite his changed circumstances?" "¿Imaynatan Barzilai yuyaqña kashaspapas Dios sonqo kayninta rikuchiran?"
"Coming to grips with physical changes can be difficult." "Machu paya kayqa sasan."
"Nevertheless, it is possible to demonstrate godly devotion despite such changes." "Ichaqa ruwashallankumanmi Jehová Diospa munayninta."
"Barzillai the Gileadite is a fine example in this regard." "Chaytan Galaad hallp’amanta Barzilai runa ruwaran."
"At 80 years of age, he showed extraordinary hospitality to David and his army, providing them with food and lodging during Absalom’s rebellion." "Pusaq chunka watanpiña karan chaypas, Absalonmanta ayqekushaqtinkun Davidta soldadonkunatawan sumaqta chaskispa mikhuchiran qorpacharan ima."
"When David was returning to Jerusalem, Barzillai escorted the entourage to the Jordan River. David offered to make Barzillai a part of his royal court." "Jerusalén llaqtaman David kutipushaqtinmi Barzilai riysiran Jordán mayu patakama, chaypin kamachikuqqa niran, haku uywakanpusqayki, nispa."
"Barzillai’s response? “I am eighty years old today...." "Paytaq kutichiran: “Pusaq chunka watayoqñan kani [...]."
"Could your servant taste what I ate and what I drank, or could I listen anymore to the voice of male and female singers?..." "Manan sumaqtañachu mikhunipas ukyanipas."
"Here is your servant Chimham." "Takiqkunaq kunkantapas manan uyariniñachu."
"Let him cross over with my lord the king; and you do to him what is good in your eyes. ” ​ — 2 Samuel 17: 27 - 29; 19: 31 - 40." "[...] Aswanpas, señor reyníy, Quimam churiymi kaypi kashan, pay richun servinasuykipaq, ima munasqaykita payman qoy ”, nispa (2 Samuel 17: 27 - 29; 19: 31 - 40)."
"In spite of his changed circumstances, Barzillai did what he could to support Jehovah’s appointed king." "Yuyaqña karan chaypas atisqanman hinan Barzilaiqa kallpachakuran Jehová Diospa akllasqan kamachikuqta yanapananpaq."
"Though he recognized that his sense of taste and of hearing were no longer what they had been, he was not bitter. Instead, by unselfishly recommending that Chimham receive the benefits offered, Barzillai revealed the kind of man that he was at heart." "Payqa manan ñakapakuranchu ninrinpa roqt’oyapusqanwan manaña sumaqta mikhusqanwanpas, aswanmi kamachikuqta niran, Quimamta pusay munachiwasqaykitapas payman qopuy nispa, chaypin payqa rikuchiran sumaq runa kasqanta."
"Like Barzillai, many aged ones today display a spirit of unselfishness and generosity." "Kunan p’unchaypas askha yuyaq wayqe pananchiskunan Barzilai hina sumaq sonqo kanku."
"They do what they can to support true worship, knowing that “with such sacrifices God is well pleased. ”" "Atisqankuman hinan yanapakunku cheqaq yupaychay mast’arikunanpaq, yachankun ‘ chay hina sacrificiokunawan Diospa kusikusqanta ’."
"What a blessing to have loyal ones in our midst! ​ — Hebrews 13: 16." "¡Ancha sumaqmi chhayna hunt’aq sonqo wayqe pananchiskunawan llank’ayqa!"
"How does David’s advanced age add meaning to the words recorded at Psalm 37: 23 - 25?" "¿Imaynatan Davidpa yuyaq kayninpi qelqasqan chaninchan Salmo 37: 23 - 25 textopi nisqanta?"
"Though David’s circumstances changed many times over the years, he remained convinced that Jehovah’s care for his loyal servants never changes." "Jehová Diosqa manan hayk’aqpas hunt’aq kamachinkunata saqerparinchu, chaytan David yacharan watakunaq pasasqanman hina imaymana tarikusqanpi."
"Toward the end of his life, David composed the song known today as Psalm 37." "Wañupunan patapiña kashaspan Davidqa sumaq takita takiran, chaymi tarikun Salmo qelqapi 37 capitulopi."
"Just imagine David in a reflective mood, accompanying himself on the harp and singing these words: “By Jehovah the very steps of an able - bodied man have been made ready, and in his way He takes delight." "Payqa allinta yuyaykuspachá arpata hap’ispa kay simikunata takiran: “Señor Diosmi runataqa pusan may ñannintachus purinanta, paymi munasqan runata allinta sayachin."
"Although he may fall, he will not be hurled down, for Jehovah is supporting his hand." "Urmanqaña chaypas, manan wikch’urayashallanqachu, Señor Diosmi paytaqa makinmanta aysarin."
"A young man I used to be, I have also grown old, and yet I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely, nor his offspring looking for bread. ”" "Waynallan karqani, kunantaq machuyapuniña, manan hayk’aqpas rikurqanichu chanin runata Señor Diospa saqerparisqanta, manan hayk’aqpas rikurqanichu wawankunatapas mikhuna mañapakushaqta ” (Salmo 37: 23 - 25)."
"Jehovah saw fit to include reference to David’s age in this inspired psalm. What depth of feeling that adds to those heartfelt words!" "Jehová Diosmi chay qelqapi Davidpa yuyaq kasqanta qelqachiran, chaywanmi astawan chaninchakuran chay qelqapi sonqomanta rimasqan."
"How did the apostle John set a fine example of faithfulness despite changed circumstances and old age?" "¿Imaynatan apóstol Juan rikuchiran hunt’aq kayninta yuyaqña karan imaynapiña tarikuran chaypas?"
"The apostle John is another fine example of faithfulness despite changed circumstances and advanced age." "Apóstol Juanpas yuyaqña karan imaynapiña tarikuran chaypas allin ejemplo karan hunt’aq kayninpi."
"After serving God for close to 70 years, John was exiled to the isle of Patmos “for speaking about God and bearing witness to Jesus. ”" "Qanchis chunka wata hinaña Diospa munayninta ruwashaqtinmi Patmos islaman qarqosqa karan, ‘ Diospa siminta Jesucristomantawan willasqanrayku ’."
"Yet, his work was not finished." "Ichaqa askharaqmi ruwanan kasharan."
"In fact, all the writings in the Bible that were penned by John were written in the final years of his life." "Yuyaq kashaspañan Bibliapi tarikuq librokunata qelqaran."
"While on Patmos, he was given the awe - inspiring vision of Revelation, which he carefully put down in writing." "Patmos islapi preso kashaqtinmi musphanapaq rikhuriykunata rikuran, chay rikhuriykunatan qelqaran."
"It is generally thought that he was released from exile during the reign of Roman Emperor Nerva. Thereafter, by about 98 C.E., when he was probably 90 or 100 years of age, John wrote the Gospel and the three epistles bearing his name." "Chay qhepamansi Roma suyupi Nerva sutiyoq kamachikuq kacharichipunman karan, 98 watapitaq isqon chunka otaq pachak watanpi hinaña kashaqtin Juan nisqa librota qelqaran sutinwan sutichasqa kinsa cartakunatawan."
"An Unfading Record of Endurance" "Qaqa sayasqankuqa manan qonqasqachu kanqa"
"How can those who have become impaired in their ability to communicate demonstrate their devotion to Jehovah?" "¿Imaynatan qallunku watakapuq cristianokuna Dios sonqo kasqankuta rikuchinkuman?"
"Limitations can come in many forms and in different degrees." "Yuyaq cristianokunapaqqa imaymana sasachakuykunan kan."
"Some individuals, for example, have become impaired even in their ability to communicate. However, they still cherish fond memories of God’s love and undeserved kindness." "Yachanapaq, wakin cristianokunaq qallunmi watakapushan, chaywanpas paykunaqa kusikuywanmi yuyarinku Jehová Diospa munakuyninta sumaq sonqo kaynintapas."
"Though limited in what they can say with their mouth, in their heart they are saying to Jehovah: “How I do love your law!" "Manaña allintachu rimanku chaypas sonqonkupin Jehová Diosta ninku: “¡Maytapunin yachachikuy simiykitaqa munakuni!"

"Yes, older ones can relate how the understanding of truth has been progressively revealed." "Hinaspapas kurak cristianokunan willawasunman imaynatan cheqaq yachachikuy pisi pisimanta ch’uyanchakuran."
"The Bible encourages us to benefit from this wealth of experience. ​ — Deuteronomy 32: 7." "Bibliaq nisqan hina yuyaq cristianokunatan tapukunanchis astawan yachananchispaq (Deuteronomio 32: 7)."
"Elderly Christians are urged to be good examples to the younger ones." "Yuyaq cristianokunan qhepa miraykunapaq allin ejemplo kananku."
"Perhaps now you do not see the effect that your endurance, prayers, and counsel has on others." "Manapaschá kunan reparashankichu imaynata hukkunata yanapashan qaqa sayasqayki, mañakusqayki, yuyaychasqaykipas."
"Noah, Abraham, Joseph, Moses, and others could not possibly have known the full impact of their faithfulness on the generations to come." "Noé, Abrahán, José, Moisés hukkunapas manan yacharankuchu imaynatan hunt’aq kayninku qhepa miraykunata yanaparan."
"Yet, their legacy of faith and integrity mattered greatly; so does yours." "Ichaqa iñiyninkupas hunt’aq kasqankupas manan qonqasqachu karan, qanpapas manan qonqasqachu kanqa."
"What blessings await those who maintain their hope firm to the end?" "¿Ima saminchaykunan kanqa p’uchukaykama suyakuqkunapaq?"

"Rather than experiencing relentless deterioration of our bodies, we will awaken each day to progressive physical improvements ​ — more energy, sharper vision, keener hearing, better looks!" "Cuerponchis machuyapunanmantaqa sapa p’unchay rikch’arispan aswan kallpayoq kasun, ñawipas aswan allinta qhawarinqa, ninripas kicharikunqa, aswan sumaq rikch’ayniyoqtaq kasunpas (Job 33: 25; Isaías 35: 5, 6)."

"We Are “Wonderfully Made ”" "Ancha musphana ruwasqan kashanchis"
"“In a fear - inspiring way I am wonderfully made. ” ​ — PSALM 139: 14." "‘ Ancha musphana ruwasqan kani ’ (SALMO 139: 14)."
"Why do many thinking people credit God for earth’s wonders?" "¿Imaraykun askha runakuna ninku: Hallp’api musphana kaqkunaqa Diospa ruwasqanmi, nispa?"
"THE natural world is filled with wonderful creations." "KAY PACHAQA imaymana musphana ruwasqakunawanmi hunt’a kashan."
"How did they come to be?" "¿Imaynatataq chaykunari paqarimuran?"
"Some believe that the answer can be found without referring to an intelligent Creator." "Wakinmi ninku, chayta yachanapaqqa manan Diospiraqchu iñinanchis, nispa."
"Others hold that arbitrarily ruling out a Creator limits our ability to understand nature." "Wakintaqmi ninku: Dios mana kaqtinqa manan entiendeyta atisunmanchu kay pachapi imaymana kaqkunata, nispa."
"They believe that earth’s creatures are far too complex, too varied and, you might say, too wonderful to have originated by chance." "Paykunaqa kay pachapi kawsaqkunata qhawarinku mana entiendey atiy kasqanta, sinchi askhapuni kasqanta, sinchi musphana ruwasqa kasqantapas, chaymi mana creenkuchu qonqayllamanta paqarisqanpi."
"To many people, some scientists included, the evidence shows that the universe had a wise, powerful, and benevolent Maker." "Askha runakunan, askha cientificokunapas ninku, kay pachatapas hanaq pachatapas yachayniyoq atiyniyoq munakuq Diosmi kamaran, kantaqmi askha pruebakuna chaykunamanta, nispa."

"What moved David to praise Jehovah?" "¿Imaraykun David Jehová Diosta yupaycharan?"
"King David of ancient Israel was one who was convinced that a Maker deserves praise for His wonderful creations." "Rey Davidmi cheqaqtapuni yacharan Kamaqqa tukuy imaymana musphana ruwasqankunamanta yupaychasqa kananta."
"David needed only to consider his own makeup to be profoundly awed by God’s creative ability." "Manaña chay tiempopi ciencia nisqa ñawpariranraqchu chaypas, Davidqa utirayaranraqmi Diospa kamasqankunata qhawaspa."
"“I shall laud you because in a fear - inspiring way I am wonderfully made, ” he wrote." "Cuerponta qhawaykukuspallaraqmi muspharan imayna kamasqa kasqanmanta."
"“Your works are wonderful, as my soul is very well aware. ” ​ — Psalm 139: 14." "Chayrayku qelqaran: “Ancha musphana ruwasqa kasqaymantan yupaychayki, utirayanapaqmi ruwasqaykikunaqa, allintapunin chaytaqa yachani ”, nispa (Salmo 139: 14)."
"3, 4." "3, 4."
"Why is it important for each of us to think seriously about Jehovah’s works?" "¿Imaraykun allinta yuyaymanananchis Jehová Diospa ruwasqankunapi?"
"David gained this strong conviction by thinking seriously." "Davidqa Diospa kamasqankunapi allinta yuyaymanaspanmi chaykunata niran."
"Today, school curriculums and the media are replete with faith - destroying theories about man’s origin." "Kunanqa iñiyninchista waqllichiwananchispaqmi colegiopi, radiopi, televisionpi, periodicokunapipas imaymanata yachachinku runaq paqarisqanmanta."
"For us to have faith like that of David, we too must think seriously." "Chaymi ñoqanchispas David hina iñiyniyoq kanapaq allinta yuyaymanananchis."
"We cannot afford to let others think for us, especially on such fundamental issues as the existence and role of a Creator." "Manan hukkunaq nisqallantachu hap’ikunanchis Dios kanchus icha manachus chayta yachananchispaq, imachus Diospa munaynin kasqantapas yachananchispaq."
"Moreover, contemplating Jehovah’s works strengthens our appreciation for him and gives us confidence in his promises for the future. That, in turn, can motivate us to get to know Jehovah even better and to serve him." "Chaymantapas, Jehová Diospa ruwasqankunapi yuyaymanasun chayqa, astawanmi Diosta munakusun, agradecekusun, hamuq tiempopaq promesankunapipas iñisun, chaytaqmi kallpachawasun aswan allinta Diosta reqsinanchispaq servinanchispaqpas."

"(b) What role do our kidneys play?" "b) ¿Imakunatan rurunkuna ruwanku?"
"“You yourself produced my kidneys; you kept me screened off in the belly of my mother. ”" "“Qanmi sonqo ruruyta [‘ rurunniykunata ’, NM] ruwarqanki, qanmi mamaypa wiksanpi hank’ukunawan minichawarqanki. ”"
"All of us began our existence inside our mother’s body as a single cell smaller than the period at the end of this sentence." "(Salmo 139: 13.) Llapanchismi mamanchispa wiksanpi wiñayta qallariranchis, nut’u aqo sayay ch’ulla celulallamanta."
"That microscopic cell was extremely complex ​ — a miniature chemical laboratory!" "Chay celulaqa imaymana ruwaq fábrica hinan."
"It grew rapidly." "Usqhayllatan wiñariran."
"By the end of your second month in the womb, your major organs were already formed." "Iskay killapaqqa ñan rikhurisqaña sonqo, sorq’ankuna, kukupin, rurunkunapas (riñones)."
"Among them were your kidneys. When you were born, your kidneys were ready to filter your blood supply ​ — removing toxins and excess water but retaining useful substances." "Nacenanchis p’unchaypaqqa rurunninchiskunaqa listoñan kasharan yawarta suysuspa qhellikunata wikch’unanpaq, yawarpi nishu unu kaqtin orqonanpaq, yawarpi vitaminakunatataq ichaqa kaqllapi saqenanpaq."

"Your kidneys also help control the mineral content of your blood as well as its acidity and pressure." "Rurunkunaqa yanapallantaqmi yawarpi mana nishu askha minerales nisqakuna, ácido nisqakuna kananpaq, cuerpopi yawartapas allinta purichin."
"They perform many other vital functions, such as converting vitamin D to an active form necessary for proper bone development and producing the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production in your bones." "Chaymantapas ruwallankutaqmi huk llank’aykunatapas, ejemplopaq: vitamina D nisqata huknirayman tukuchin tullunchiskuna wiñananpaq.

"The original cell divided, and the new cells continued to divide." "(Salmo 139: 15.)"
"Soon the cells began to differentiate, or specialize, to become nerve cells, muscle cells, skin cells, and so forth." "Qallariy celulaqa askha celulakunamanmi t’aqakuran, pisi tiempollamantataq chay mosoq celulakuna t’aqa - t’aqapi huñukuranku, wakinmi hank’ukunaman tukuran, wakintaq aychaman, wakintaq aycha qaraman, hukkunamanpas."

"By the time you were just seven weeks old and only about an inch [2.5 cm] long, early forms of all 206 of your adult bones were in place, although they had not yet ossified, or turned into hard bone."

"Science may eventually find out, but as David next observed, our Maker ​ — Jehovah — ​ has fully understood it all along." "Yaqapaschá qhepaman ciencia nisqa chayta yachanqa, ichaqa, Davidpa nisqan hina, Kamaqninchis Jehová Diosqa yacharanpunin."

"Your first cell contained the complete plan for your entire body." "(Salmo 139: 16, NM.)"
"This plan guided your development during your nine months in the womb before birth and then through more than two decades of growth to adulthood." "Qallariy celulapiqa qelqasqañan kasharan cuerponchis imayna kanan."
"During this time, your body passed through many stages, all directed by the information programmed into that original cell." "Chayman hina wiñaranchis mamanchispa wiksanpi kasqanchismantapacha kuraq runa kananchiskama."
"David had no knowledge of cells and genes, being without even a microscope." "Chay watakunapin cuerponchisqa pisi - pisimanta wiñaran qallariy celulapi qelqasqa kasqanman hina."
"But he correctly discerned that the development of his own body attested to advance planning." "Davidqa manan imatapas yacharanchu celulakunamantaqa, payqa manan reqsiranpaschu microscopio nisqata; ichaqa cuerponpa wiñarisqanta qhawarispan repararan cuerpon imayna wiñarinanqa nisqaña kasqanta."

"Tayta - mamanchisman abuelonchiskunamanpas rikch’akunchis sayayninchispi, uyanchispi, chukchanchispi, ñawinchispi, hukkunapipas; kunanqa yachakunmi imayna rikch’ayniyoq kananchisqa genes nisqapi qelqasqa kasqanta."

"Building instructions for your body are “written ” in the chemical structure of your personal DNA." "Chay ADN nisqapin ‘ qelqasqa ’ hina kashan cuerponchis imayna kananmanta."
"Every time your cells divide ​ — to make new cells or to replace old cells — ​ your DNA passes those instructions on, thereby keeping you alive and maintaining your basic appearance." "Celulakuna t’aqakuqtinmi mosoq celulakuna rikhurin, chaykunapipas ADN nisqa rikhurillantaq."
"What an outstanding example of the power and wisdom of our heavenly Maker!" "Chhaynapin wakin celulakuna wañunkuña chaypas, kawsashallanchis mosoq celulakuna rikhuriqtin, rikch’ayninchispas manan hukniraymanchu tukupun."

"“So, to me how precious your thoughts are!" "“Diosníy, ñoqapaqqa ancha chaniyoqmi yuyaykusqaykikunaqa, ancha askhallañan chaykunaqa."
"O God, how much does the grand sum of them amount to!" "Chaykunata yupariyta munayman chaypas, aqomantapas aswan askharaqmi kanman. ”"
"Were I to try to count them, they are more than even the grains of sand. ”" "(Salmo 139: 17, 18a.)"
"Animals too are wonderfully made, and some possess certain senses and abilities that exceed those of humans." "Animalkunapas musphana ruwasqan kashanku, wakinqa runakunaq mana atisqantaraqmi ruwanku."
"But God gave humans mental faculties that far surpass those of any animal." "Diosmi ichaqa runata kamaran animalkunamanta aswan yuyayniyoqta."
"“As similar as we humans are in many ways to other species, we are unique among the earth’s life forms in our ability to use language and thought, ” notes one science textbook.“ We are also unique in our profound curiosity about ourselves: How are we put together physically? How were we formed? ”" "Huk cientificon niran: “Askhapiña animalkunaman rikch’akunchis chaypas, runakunallan rimanchispas yuyaykunchispas, chaymantapas runakunallan tapurikunchis cuerponchis imayna kamasqa kasqanmanta ”, nispa."
"These are questions that David likewise pondered." "Kaqllatataqmi Davidpas tapurikuran."
"(a) How could David meditate on God’s thoughts?" "a) ¿Imaraykun David Diospa yuyaykusqankunapi yuyaymanayta atiran?"
"(b) How can we follow David’s example?" "b) ¿Imaynatan ñoqanchispas David hina kasunman?"
"Most important, in contrast with animals, we are unique in our ability to contemplate God’s thoughts." "Astawanqa animalkunamanta hukniray kanchis kaypi: runallan Diospa yuyaykusqankunapi yuyaymanayta atinchis."
"* This special gift is one of the ways that we are made “in God’s image. ” David made good use of this gift." "* Chaymi rikuchin ‘ Diosman rikch’akuq ’ kamasqa kasqanchista (Génesis 1: 27)."
"He meditated on the evidence of God’s existence and the good qualities reflected in the earth around him." "Davidqa yuyaymanaranpunin tukuy kamasqakunapi, chaykunapin repararan Dios cheqaq kasqanta Diospa sumaq kayninkunatawan."
"David also had the early books of the Holy Scriptures, which contain revelations by God about himself and his works." "Chaymantapas, hap’iranñan Bibliaq qallariy qelqankunata, chay Qelqakunapin willakushan Diosmanta, ruwasqankunamantapas."
"These inspired writings helped David to understand God’s thoughts, personality, and purpose." "Chay qelqakunawanmi David yanapachikuran Diospa yuyaykusqanta, imayna kasqanta, munaynintapas entiendenanpaq."
"Meditating on the Scriptures, on creation, and on God’s dealings with him moved David to praise his Maker." "Bibliapi, kamasqakunapi, Diospa yanapasqanpipas yuyaymanasqanmi Davidta kallpacharan Kamaqninta hatunchananpaq."
"What Faith Involves" "¿Iman iñiyniyoq kay?"
"Why do we not need to know everything about God in order to have faith in him?" "¿Imaraykun mana llapantaraqchu Diosmanta yachana iñiyniyoq kanapaq?"
"The more David contemplated creation and the Scriptures, the more he realized that comprehending the full range of God’s knowledge and ability was beyond his grasp." "Diospa kamasqankunata Simin Qelqatawan t’aqwispanmi Davidqa allinta repararan kayta: manan pipas Diospa yachayninta atiynintapas llapantaqa entiendeyta atinmanchu (Salmo 139: 6)."
"The same is true of us. We will never understand everything about all of God’s creative works." "Ñoqanchispas manan hayk’aqpas Diospa llapan ruwasqankunataqa entiendesunchu (Eclesiastés 3: 11; 8: 17)."
"But God has ‘ made manifest ’ enough knowledge through the Scriptures and in nature to enable truth - seekers living in any era to acquire faith that is based on evidence. ​ — Romans 1: 19, 20; Hebrews 11: 1, 3." "Chaywanpas, Jehová Diosqa Simin Qelqapi, imaymana kamasqanpipas yachayninta ‘ sut’inchan ’, chhaynapi pipas cheqaq - kayta yachay munaqqa chay yachayninta qhawarispa iñiyniyoq kanman."
"Illustrate how faith and our relationship with God are linked." "¿Imaynapin tupan iñiywan Diosman asuykuywan?"
"Having faith involves more than merely acknowledging that life and the universe must have had an intelligent Source." "Iñiyniyoq kayqa manan: Diosmi tukuy imaymana Kamaqqa, niyllachu."
"It includes trusting in Jehovah God as a person ​ — a person who wants us to get to know him and to maintain a good relationship with him." "Aswanpas, tukuy sonqowanmi Diosman hap’ipakunanchis, payqa munanmi reqsinanchista, payman asuykunanchistapas."
"We might think of the faith and trust one has in a loving father." "Imaynan churipas munakuq taytanman hap’ipakun chay hinatan ñoqanchispas Diosman hap’ipakunanchis."
"If a skeptic questioned whether your father would really help you in a crisis, you might not be able to convince him that your father is trustworthy." "Yaqapaschá chay churita pipas ninman, manachus hina taytaykiqa yanapasunkimanchu sasachakuypi tarikuqtiyki, nispa."
"If through experience you have accumulated evidence of your father’s good character, however, you can be confident that he will not let you down." "Chay runa iskayashaqtinpas churiqa yachanmi taytan munakuq kasqanta, chaymi mana iskayanchu yanapananmanta."
"Similarly, coming to know Jehovah by studying the Scriptures, contemplating creation, and experiencing his help in answer to our prayers moves us to trust in him." "Ñoqanchispas Jehová Diosta allinta reqsinchis Bibliata estudiaspa, kamasqankunapi yuyaymanaspa, mañakusqanchisman kutichisqanta reparaspapas, chaymi payman hap’ipakunchis."
"It makes us want to learn ever more about him and to praise him forever out of unselfish love and devotion." "Diosmanta yachasqanchis, payta munakusqanchis, tukuy sonqo yupaychasqanchispas kallpachawanchismi astawanraq payta reqsinanchispaq wiñay - wiñaypaq hatunchananchispaqpas."
"That is the most noble purpose that anyone can pursue. ​ — Ephesians 5: 1, 2." "¡Ancha allinpunin chay ruwayqa!"
"Seek Our Maker’s Guidance!" "Kamaqninchispa yanapayninta maskhasun"
"What can we learn from David’s close relationship with Jehovah?" "¿Imatan yachanchis David Diosman asuykusqanmanta?"
"“Search through me, O God, and know my heart." "“Diosníy, t’aqwiriway, sonqoyta reqsiykuway, allinta probaykuway, yuyaykuyniykunata reqsiykuy."
"Examine me, and know my disquieting thoughts, and see whether there is in me any painful way, and lead me in the way of time indefinite. ”" "Qhawariway, urmachiq ñanpipaschá purishani, wiñay ñanninta pusakuway. ” (Salmo 139: 23, 24.)"
"David was aware that Jehovah already knew him thoroughly ​ — everything that he thought, said, or did was within the scope of his Maker’s view." "Davidqa allintan yacharan Jehová Diospa allin reqsisqan kasqanta: ima ruwasqanpas yuyaykusqanpas reqsisqanpas Kamaqninpa rikusqanpunin karan (Salmo 139: 1 - 12; Hebreos 4: 13)."
"Such intimate knowledge on God’s part made David feel secure, just as a small child feels secure in the arms of his loving parents." "Chaymi Davidqa mana iskayaranchu Diospa pakaykunanmanta, imaynan wawachapas tayta - maman marq’akuqtin mana imatapas manchakunchu hina."
"David cherished this close relationship with Jehovah and strove to maintain it by thinking deeply about His works and by praying to Him." "Davidpaqqa ancha allinpunin karan Jehová Diosman asuykuy, chaymi Diosmanta mana karunchakunanpaq Diospa ruwasqankunapi yuyaymanaran, mañakuranpas."
"In fact, many of David’s psalms ​ — including Psalm 139 — ​ are essentially prayers set to music." "Davidpa qelqasqan Salmokunamanta wakinqa, Salmo 139 nisqapas manan takikunallachu, aswanpas mañakuykunan."
"Meditation and prayer can likewise help us to draw close to Jehovah." "Ñoqanchispas Jehová Diosman asuykunapaqqa yuyaymanananchis, paymantataq mañakunanchis."
"(a) Why did David want Jehovah to examine his heart?" "a) ¿Imaraykun David Jehová Diosta mañakuran sonqonta reqsiykunanta?"
"(b) How does the way we exercise our free will affect our lives?" "b) ¿Imaynatan kawsasunchis allin kaqta akllakuqtinchis otaq mana allin kaqta akllakuqtinchispas?"
"Being made in God’s image, we are endowed with free will. We can choose to do good or to do bad." "Diospa rikch’ayninman hina kamasqa kaqtinchismi atinchis allin kaqta otaq mana allin kaqtapas akllakuyta."
"With that freedom comes moral accountability." "Ima akllakusqanchismantan ichaqa Diosman cuentata qosun."
"David did not want to be classed with the wicked." "Davidqa manan munaranchu mana allin runakunawan huñukuyta (Salmo 139: 19 - 22)."
"He wanted to avoid making painful mistakes." "Payqa manan munaranchu huchaman urmayta."
"Thus, upon contemplating Jehovah’s all - encompassing knowledge, David humbly asked God to examine his innermost person and to guide him in the way that leads to life." "Chayrayku Diospa allin reqsisqan kasqanta yuyaymanaspa Diosmanta tukuy sonqo mañakuran sonqonta t’aqwinanpaq kawsay ñanninta pusarinanpaqpas."
"God’s righteous moral standards apply to everyone; so we too need to make right choices." "Diospa chanin kamachikuyninkunaqa lliwpaqmi, chaymi allin kaqta akllakunanchis."
"Jehovah urges all of us to obey him." "Jehová Diosqa kallpachawanchismi kasukunanchispaq."
"Doing so brings us his favor and many benefits." "Payta kasukusun chayqa, sumaqtan qhawariwasun askha saminchaykunatataq chaskisunpas."

"Seeing that, Saul “went offering up the burnt sacrifice. ”" "Chay ruwasqanqa sinchitapunin Jehová Diosta phiñachiran."
"This was displeasing to Jehovah. When Samuel finally arrived, the king excused his own disobedience, saying that because Samuel was late, he ‘ compelled himself ’ to offer up the burnt sacrifice to soften Jehovah’s face." "Samuel chayamuqtintaq Saulqa niran: Mana chayamuqtiykin ñoqallaña ‘ munay mana munay ’ ruphachina sacrificiota haywarani Jehová Dios yanapawananpaq, nispa."
"To King Saul, offering that sacrifice was more important than obeying the direction he had received to wait for Samuel to make that sacrifice." "Saulpaqqa sacrificio haywaymi aswan allin karan kasukuymantaqa, chaymi Samuelta mana suyaranchu sacrificio haywananpaq."

"Later, Jehovah commanded Saul to annihilate the nation of Amalek, which had earlier attacked Israel without provocation. Saul was not even to spare their domestic animals." "Chay qhepamanmi Jehová Dios Saulta kamachiran Amalec llaqtata thuninanpaq, Egipto llaqtamanta Israel runakuna lloqsishaqtinkun chay llaqta mana imallamanta paykunawan maqanakuq lloqsimuran; chayraykun Diosqa kamachiran lliw runakunata uywankunatawan wañuchinanpaq."

"What lesson did Saul fail to learn?" "¿Imatan Saúl mana entienderanchu?"

"Look! To obey is better than a sacrifice, to pay attention than the fat of rams. ”" "Aswan allinqa uyarikuymi, kasukuymi uywakunaq wiran ruphachinamantaqa ”, nispa (1 Samuel 15: 22)."

"Today, our obeying Jehovah may involve enduring persecution in order to maintain our integrity." "Qatiykachasqaña kaspapas Jehová Diostan kasukunanchis tukuy sonqo."
"Also, our obeying Jehovah’s command to preach and to teach requires that we endure until the end of this system of things." "Chaymantapas, predicaychis yachachiychis nisqa kamachikuyta kasukunapaqqa, kay pachaq p’uchukanankama aguantananchis."
"We need endurance to continue gathering together with our brothers, even though we may feel the weight of pressures from the world." "Huñunakuykunaman rishanallanchispaqpas aguantananchismi sasachakuykunapiña tarikuspapas."
"Our loving God is fully aware of our efforts to be obedient in such areas." "Munakuq Diosninchisqa makillan qhawamuwashanchis munayninta ruwanapaq kallpachakuqtinchis."
"To be fully obedient, however, we have to fight our sinful flesh and turn away from bad while building appreciation for what is good. ​ — Romans 12: 9." "Tukuy imaymanapi kasukuqpuni kananchispaqqa, manapuni kasukunachu aychanchispa munayninta, aswanpas mana allin kaqta cheqnikunanchis allin kaqtataq munakunanchis."

"WHEN a child is shoved by a sibling, usually the child’s first reaction is to shove back." "HUK ERQETA wayqen tanqarpariqtinqa paypas tanqarparillantaqmi."
"Sadly, such tit - for - tat behavior is not limited to children." "Ichaqa manan erqekunallachu chayta ruwanakunku."
"Many adults act similarly. When offended by someone, they want to get even." "Kurakkunapas kaqllatataqmi ruwanku: pipas dañota ruwaqtinqa kaqllawantaqmi kutichinku."
"Granted, most adults will not give a literal shove, but many will push back in subtle ways." "Manapaschá makinwanchu tanqarparinku, ichaqa hukniraymantan mana allinwan kutichinku."
"Perhaps they spread harmful gossip about the offender or find ways to prevent him from succeeding." "Yaqapaschá chay runamanta mana allinta rimanqa otaq imapipas dañota ruwanqa."
"Whatever method is used, the intent is the same ​ — to repay in kind, to retaliate." "Imaynaña kaqtinpas vengakuytapunin munanku."
"(a) Why do true Christians resist the urge to retaliate?" "a) ¿Imaraykun llapa cristianokuna kallpachakunku mana vengakuq kanankupaq?"
"(b) What questions and which Bible chapter will we consider?" "b) ¿Ima tapukuykunatan kutichikunqa?"
"Although the urge to get even is deep - seated, true Christians resist giving in to it." "¿Romanos libromanta ima capitulotan t’aqwirisun?"
"Instead, they strive to follow the apostle Paul’s admonition: “Return evil for evil to no one. ”" "Llapa runakunaq sonqonpin saphichasqa kashan vengakuq kay, cheqaq cristianokunan ichaqa kallpachakunku mana vengakuq kanankupaq, chhaynapin apóstol Pabloq nisqanta kasukunku, paymi niran: “Ama pimanpas mana allinmantaqa mana allinllawantaq kutichiychischu ”, nispa."

"What benefits will be reaped if we refrain from getting even?" "¿Ima allinkunan kanqa mana vengakuqtinchis?"
"To answer those questions, let us study the context of Paul’s words and see how Romans chapter 12 shows that refraining from retaliation is the right, the loving, and the modest course to follow." "Chay tapukuykunaman kutichinapaqqa ñawpaqta t’aqwirisun Romanos 12 capitulopi vengakuymanta apóstol Pabloq qelqasqanta, chaypin yachasun vengakuymanta karunchakuqqa allinkaq ruwasqanta, munakuyniyoq kasqanta, huch’uyaykukuq kasqantawan."
"We will consider these three aspects, one at a time." "Chay kinsantin allin ruwaykunatan huk hukmanta t’aqwirisun."
"“Consequently I Entreat You ”" "“Chay hinaqa [...] valekuykichis ”"
"3, 4. (a) Beginning with Romans chapter 12, what does Paul discuss, and what is the significance of his use of the word “consequently ”?" "3, 4. a) ¿Pikunawan allinpi kawsanamantan Pablo willashan Romanos 12 capitulomantapacha? ¿Imatan nisharan “chay hinaqa ” nispa nisqanwan?"
"(b) What effect should God’s compassion have had on the Christians in Rome?" "b) ¿Imaynatan Roma llaqtapi cristianokuna Diospa khuyapayakuyninman kutichinanku karan?"
"Beginning in chapter 12, Paul considers four related subjects that affect a Christian’s life." "Romanos 12 capitulomantapachan apóstol Pablo willashan Jehová Dioswan, iñiqmasinchiskunawan, mana iñiqkunawan, kamachikuqkunawanpas allinpi kawsananchismanta."
"He describes our relationship with Jehovah, with fellow believers, with nonbelievers, and with governmental authorities." "Ñawpaqtan apóstol Pablo sut’inchan imarayku vengakuytapas mana allin kaqtapas atipananchis."
"Paul indicates that there is a fundamental reason to resist wrong inclinations, including the urge to retaliate, when he states: “Consequently I entreat you by the compassions of God, brothers. ”" "Kayta qelqaran: “Chay hinaqa, wawqe - panaykuna, Diospa khuyapayawasqanchisraykun valekuykichis ”, nispa."
"Note the word “consequently, ” which means“ in view of the foregoing. ”" "Allinta reparasun “chay hinaqa ” nispa nisqanpi, chay simiqa,“ ñawpaqpi nisqay hina ” ninanmi."
"Paul in effect says, ‘ In view of what I just explained to you, I entreat you to do what I will tell you next. ’" "Pabloqa kaytan nisharan: “Ñawpaqpi nisqay hina, valekuykichis kayta ruwanaykichispaq ”, nispa."
"What had Paul explained to those Christians in Rome?" "¿Imaniranmi ñawpaqta apóstol Pablo Roma llaqtapi cristianokunata?"
"In the first 11 chapters of his letter, Paul discussed the wonderful opportunity open to both Jews and Gentiles to become rulers with Christ in God’s Kingdom, a hope that natural Israel failed to accept." "Ñawpaq chunka hukniyoq capitulokunapin apóstol Pablo willaranña Diospa Reinonpi kamachikuymanta, chay sumaq suyakuymi karan judío runakunapaq wak llaqtayoq runakunapaqwan."
"That precious privilege became possible only “by the compassions of God. ”" "‘ Khuyapayakuq ’ kayninpin Diosqa chay sumaq suyakuyta paykunaman qoran."
"How should Christians respond to this great undeserved kindness on God’s part?" "¿Imaynatan cristianokuna kutichinkuman Diospa khuyapayakuyninman?"
"Their hearts should be filled with such deeply felt gratitude that they would be moved to do what Paul states next: “Present your bodies a sacrifice living, holy, acceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason. ”" "Tukuy sonqomanta agradecekuspan Pabloq kay nisqanta kasukunanku karan: “Cuerpoykichista Diosman haywaychis kawsashaq ofrendata, ch’uyata, Diospa sonqonman chayaq kananpaq. Chaymi cheqaq sonqowan Diosta yupaychayniykichisqa ”."
"How, though, could those Christians actually present themselves “a sacrifice ” to God?" "Chay hinaqa, ¿imatan ruwananku karan chay cristianokuna ‘ ofrenda ’ hina Diospa ñawpaqenpi kanankupaq?"
"(a) How can a person offer himself “a sacrifice ” to God?" "a) ¿Imatan ruwananchis ‘ ofrenda ’ hina Diospa ñawpaqenpi kananchispaq?"
"(b) What principle should influence a Christian’s behavior?" "b) ¿Ima kamachikuyman hinan llapa cristianokuna kawsananchis?"
"Paul goes on to explain: “Quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. ”" "Pablon nillarantaq: “Amaña runakunaq imaynatachus kawsashasqanta hinaqa kawsaychischu, aswanpas mosoqyachisqa yuyayniykichisman tupaqtapuni kawsaychis. Ahinapin mayqenchus Diospa munaynin kasqanta reparankichis, paypa munayninqa allinmi, sumaqmi, hunt’asqapunin ”, nispa."
"Instead of allowing the spirit of the world to shape their thinking, they needed to make their minds over to Christ’s way of thinking." "Kay pachapi runakunaq yuyaykusqanman hina yuyaykunankumantaqa yuyayninkutan mosoqyachinanku karan Cristo hina yuyaykunankupaq."
"That principle should influence the day - to - day behavior of all genuine Christians, including us today." "Llapa cristianokunan chay textoq nisqanman hina sapa p’unchay kawsananchis."
"Based on Paul’s reasoning found at Romans 12: 1, 2, what moves us to avoid retaliating?" "Romanos 12: 1, 2 textopi nisqan hina, ¿iman yanapawasun mana vengakuq kananchispaq?"
"How does Paul’s reasoning at Romans 12: 1, 2 help us?" "¿Imaynatan yanapawanchis Romanos 12: 1, 2 textoq nisqan?"
"Like those spirit - anointed Christians in Rome, we are deeply grateful for the continuing and manifold expressions of compassion that God has given us and continues to give us every day of our life." "Roma llaqtapi hawisqa cristianokuna hinan ñoqanchispas tukuy sonqomanta Diosta agradecekunchis khuyapayakuyninpi sapa p’unchay imaymana qowasqanchismanta."
"Consequently, a heart filled with gratitude moves us to serve God with all our strength, means, and abilities." "Agradecido kaymi tanqawanchis tukuy kallpanchiswan, kaqninchiswan, ima ruway atisqanchiswanpas Diospa munayninta ruwananchispaq."
"That heartfelt desire also moves us to do our utmost to think, not like the world, but like Christ." "Hinaspapas kallpachawanchismi Cristo hina yuyaykunapaq amataq kay pacha hinachu."
"And having the mind of Christ affects how we treat others ​ — both fellow believers and nonbelievers." "Cristo hina yuyaykuspaqa iñiqmasinchiskunatapas mana iñiqkunatapas sumaqtan qhawarisun."
"A case in point: If we think like Christ, we are compelled to resist the urge to retaliate. ​ — 1 Peter 2: 21 - 23." "Hinaspapas Cristo hina yuyaykusun chayqa manan vengakusunchu."
"“Let Your Love Be Without Hypocrisy ”" "“Tukuy sonqo munanakuychis ”"
"What type of love is considered in Romans chapter 12?" "¿Imayna munakuymantan Romanos 12 capitulopi rimashan?"
"We refrain from returning evil for evil not only because it is the right course but also because it is the loving course." "Munakuymi tanqawallasuntaq mana vengakuq kanapaq."
"Note how the apostle Paul next considers the motive of love." "Chay iskaykaq allin ruwaymanta apóstol Pabloq willasqanta t’aqwirisun."
"In the book of Romans, Paul uses the word “love ” (a·gaʹpe in Greek) several times when referring to God’s love and that of Christ." "Jehová Diospa Cristopa munakuyninmanta rimaspan apóstol Pablo Romanos qelqapi askha kutita munakuy simita (griegopi a·gá·pe) qelqaran."
"However, in chapter 12, Paul uses a·gaʹpe in a different way ​ — in speaking about love shown to fellow humans." "Ichaqa 12 capitulopin hukniray munakuymanta rimashan: runamasinchista munakuymanta."
"After noting that spiritual gifts vary and are present among some believers, Paul mentions a quality that should be cultivated by all Christians." "Manaña llapa cristianokunachu kaqkama kanchis chaypas, llapallanchismi kallpachakunanchis ‘ tukuy sonqowan munakuq ’ kanapaq."
"He states: “Let your love be without hypocrisy. ” Showing love to others is a basic mark of true Christians." "Cheqaq cristianokunaqa runamasinkuta munakusqankupin reqsichikunku."
"Paul exhorts us to make sure that the love we show as Christians is sincere." "Chayrayku apóstol Pablo kallpachawanchis tukuy sonqowan munakuq kananchispaq."
"How can we show unhypocritical love?" "¿Imaynatan tukuy sonqowan munakuq kasqanchista rikuchisunman?"
"Further, Paul notes how love without hypocrisy is shown, stating: “Abhor what is wicked, cling to what is good. ”" "Apóstol Pablon willallantaq imaynatan tukuy sonqowan munakuq kasqanchista rikuchisunman, paymi nin: “Mana allinkaqta cheqnikuychis, allinkaqtataq ruwaychis ”, nispa."
"“Abhor ” and“ cling ” are strong words." "“Cheqnikuychis ”,“ ruwaychis [“ch’ipapakuychis ”, NM] ” nisqa simikunaqa allinta yuyaykunapaqmi."
"“Abhor ” can be translated“ hate exceedingly. ”" "“Cheqnikuychis ” nisqa simiqa t’ikrakullanmantaqmi“ tukuy kallpawan millakuychis ”, nispa."
"We must hate not merely the consequences of evil but also the evil itself." "Manan mana allin ruwasqamanta ñak’ariykunaq paqarisqallantachu cheqnikuna, mana allinkaqtapas cheqnikunanchismi (Salmo 97: 10)."
"The word “cling ” is a translation of a Greek verb that literally means“ to glue. ”" "“Ch’ipapakuychis ” nisqa simiqa griego rimaymantan hamun, chay simiqa“ k’askakuy ” ninanmi."
"A Christian who has genuine love is so firmly glued, or attached, to the quality of goodness that it becomes an inseparable part of his personality." "Cheqaq munakuyniyoq cristianoqa sumaq sonqo kaymanmi k’askakun, sumaq sonqo runataq kapunpas."
"What admonition does Paul give again and again?" "¿Ima ruwaymanta karunchakunanchispaqmi Pablo askha kutipi yuyaychawanchis?"
"One particular manifestation of love is mentioned by Paul again and again. He states: “Keep on blessing those who persecute; be blessing and do not be cursing. ”" "Pablo askha kutipi rimaran munakuyta imaynata rikuchinapaq, paymi niran: “Qatiykachaqniykichiskunata saminchaychis, amataq paykunata ñakaychischu ”."
"“Return evil for evil to no one. ”" "“Ama pimanpas mana allinmantaqa mana allinllawantaq kutichiychischu ”."
"“Do not avenge yourselves, beloved. ”" "“Munasqa wawqe - panaykuna, ama qankuna kikiykichisqa vengakuychischu. ”"
"“Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good. ”" "“Mana allinkaqwanqa ama atipachikuychu, aswanpas mana allinkaqtaqa allinkaqwan atipay ”, nispa."
"Paul’s words leave no doubt about how we should treat nonbelievers, even those who oppose us." "Chay simikunawanmi apóstol Pablo sut’ita yachachiwanchis imaynatan mana iñiqkunata contranchispi kaqkunatapas qhawarinanchis."
"“Keep On Blessing Those Who Persecute ”" "“Qatiykachaqniykichiskunata saminchaychis ”"
"In what way can we bless our persecutors?" "¿Imaynatan saminchasunman qatiykachawaqninchiskunata?"
"How do we carry out Paul’s exhortation: “Keep on blessing those who persecute ”?" "‘ Qatiykachaqniykichiskunata saminchashallaychis ’ nispa apóstol Pabloq nisqanpi yuyaykusun. ¿Imaynatan chayta kasukusunman?"
"Jesus told his followers: “Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you. ”" "Jesusmi qatikuqninkunata khaynata kamachiran: “Munakuychis awqaykichiskunata, mañapuychis k’amiqniykichiskunapaqpas qatiykachaqniykichiskunapaqpas ”, nispa."
"Hence, one way in which we bless persecutors is by praying for them, petitioning God that if any are opposing us because of ignorance, Jehovah may open their eyes to the truth." "Mana yachaspa pipas qatiykachawanchis chayqa, apóstol Pabloq yuyaychawasqanchista hinan Jehová Diosmanta mañakunanchis ñawinkuta kicharispa cheqaq kayta reparachinanpaq."
"Granted, it may seem strange to ask God to bless a persecutor." "Nisunmanpaschá, ¿imaynataq Diosmanta mañakuyman qatiykachawaqniyta saminchananpaq?"
"However, the more our mind - set resembles Christ’s way of thinking, the more we will be able to extend love to our enemies." "nispa. Cristoq yuyaykusqanta hina yuyaykunapaq kallpachakuqtinchisqa manan sasachu kanqa awqanchiskunata munakuy."
"What can be the result of showing such love?" "¿Iman kanman chhayna munakusqanchismanta?"
"(a) What can we learn from the example of Stephen?" "a) ¿Imatan yachanchis Estebanpa ruwasqanmanta?"
"(b) As illustrated by Paul’s life, what change may occur in some persecutors?" "b) ¿Imamanmi tukupunkuman wakin qatiykachaqninchiskuna apóstol Pablo hina?"
"Stephen was one who prayed for his persecutors, and his prayer was not in vain." "Estebanqa allin ejemplon karan qatiykachaqkunapaq mañakuypi, manataqmi yanqapaqchu mañakuyninqa karan."
"Not long after Pentecost 33 C.E., Stephen was arrested by opposers of the Christian congregation, dragged outside Jerusalem, and stoned." "Cristianokunata qatiykachaqkunan 33 watapi Pentecostés fiesta qhepallata Estebanta hap’iranku, Jerusalén llaqta hawaman aysaspankutaq rumiwan ch’aqesqaku."
"Before he died, he cried out: “Jehovah, do not charge this sin against them. ”" "Manaraq wañupushaspan khaynata mañakuran: “¡Señornilláy kay huchankumantaqa ama paykunata huchachaychu! ”"
"One of the men for whom Stephen prayed that day was Saul, who witnessed and approved of Stephen’s murder." "nispa. Saulopas chaypin kasharan Estebanta wañuchishaqtinku allinpaqtaqmi qhawariran wañuchisqankuta, chaymi Estebanqa paypaqwan mañakuran."
"Later, the resurrected Jesus appeared to Saul." "Chay qhepamanmi Saulo huk rikhuriypi Jesusta rikuran chaymantapachan manaña cristianokunata qatiykacharanchu."
"That former persecutor became a follower of Christ and went on to become the apostle Paul, the writer of the letter to the Romans." "Paypas cristianomanmi tukupuran, paymi karan apóstol Pablo, Romanos qelqata qelqaqpas."
"In line with Stephen’s prayer, Jehovah evidently forgave Paul for the sin of being a persecutor." "Estebanpa mañakusqanta uyarispa Jehová Diosqa Pablota panpacharanmi cristianokuna qatiykachasqanmanta."
"No wonder that Paul exhorted Christians: “Keep on blessing those who persecute ”!" "¡Chaychá Pabloqa cristianokunata yuyaycharan ‘ qatiykachaqninkuta saminchashanallankupaq ’!"
"He knew from experience that some persecutors may eventually become servants of God." "Payqa allintan yacharan wakin qatiykachaqkuna Diospa kamachinman tukupunankuta."
"In our day, some persecutors have likewise become believers because of the peaceable conduct of Jehovah’s servants." "Kunan tiempopipas Jehová Diospa testigonkuna sumaq runa kasqankuta rikuspan wakin qatiykachaqkuna Diospa kamachin kapunku."
"“Be Peaceable With All Men ”" "‘ Llapa runawan sumaqpi kawsaychis ’"
"How are the words of admonition found at Romans 12: 9, 17 related?" "¿Imaynatan tupan Romanos 12: 9 versículo 17 versiculowan?"
"Paul’s next admonition on how to treat believers and unbelievers is: “Return evil for evil to no one. ”" "Pablon yuyaychawanchis mana iñiqkunata huk runakunatapas imayna qhawarinanchista, paymi niran: “Ama pimanpas mana allinmantaqa mana allinllawantaq kutichiychischu ”, nispa."
"That statement is a logical consequence of what he said earlier, namely: “Abhor what is wicked. ”" "Chay yuyaychasqanmi tupan, “mana allinkaqta cheqnikuychis ” nispa ñawpaqpi nisqanwan."
"After all, how could a person say that he truly abhors what is wicked, or evil, if he were to use evil as a means to repay others?" "¿Imaynataq huk runa mana allinkaqta cheqnikushaspa vengakuq kanman?"
"Doing so would be the opposite of having love “without hypocrisy. ”" "Vengakuq kaspaqa manachá ‘ tukuy sonqowan munakuqchu ’ kanman."
"Then Paul says: “Provide fine things in the sight of all men. ”" "Pablon nillantaq: “Llapa runaq qayllanpi allin ruwayllatapuni munaychis ”, nispa."
"How do we apply those words?" "¿Imaynatan chayta hunt’asunman?"
"In what way do we conduct ourselves “in the sight of all men ”?" "¿Imarayku nisunman “llapa runaq qayllanpi ” imatapas ruwanchis nispa?"
"Earlier, in his letter to the Corinthians, Paul wrote about the persecution that the apostles faced." "Pabloqa apostolkunaq qatiykachasqa kasqankumantan Corintios libropi kayta qelqasqa: “Kay pachaq qhawakunanmi kapuyku, angelkunaqpas runakunaqpas qhawakunanpaq [...]."
"He said: “We have become a theatrical spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men...." "Runakunan k’amiwanku, ñoqaykutaq sumaq simikunawan kutichiyku, qatiykachawankun, ñoqaykutaq hinalla muchukuyku."
"When being reviled, we bless; when being persecuted, we bear up; when being defamed, we entreat. ”" "Ñoqaykutan mana kaqmanta tumpawanku, ñoqaykutaq sumaqta kutichiyku ”, nispa."
"Similarly, true Christians today are being watched by the people of this world." "Kay tiempopi cristianokunapas llapa runaq qhawasqanmi kashanchis."
"When those around us observe the fine things we do even while we are being treated unjustly, they may be inclined to look more favorably upon our Christian message. ​ — 1 Peter 2: 12." "Mana allintaña tratawashaqtinchispas allin kawsasqanchista qhawarispan reqsiwaqninchiskuna allin willakuykunata uyarikunkuman."
"How far should we go in order to make peace?" "¿Maykaman kallpachakunanchis hukkunawan thakpi kananchispaq?"
"How far, though, should we go in order to promote peace?" "¿Maykaman kallpachakunanchis hukkunawan thakpi kananchispaq?"
"We should go as far as possible." "Tukuy atisqanchistan ruwananchis."
"Paul tells his Christian brothers: “If possible, as far as it depends upon you, be peaceable with all men. ”" "Iñiqmasinkunatan Pablo niran: “Atisqaykichisman hina allinllatapuni ruwaychis llapa runawan sumaqpi kawsanaykichispaq ”, nispa."
"“If possible ” and“ as far as it depends upon you ” are qualifying expressions indicating that making peace with others may not always be possible." "“Atisqaykichisman hina ” nisqanpin reparanchis mana llapa runakunawanchu thakpi kananchista."
"For instance, we will not disobey a command of God just to keep peace with man." "Runakunawan thakpi kananchisraykullaqa manan hayk’aqpas Diospa kamachikuyninta p’akisunmanchu."
"Still, we do everything we reasonably can ​ — without compromising righteous principles — ​ to make peace “with all men. ”" "Ichaqa Diospa kamachikuyninkunata mana p’akispan kallpachakunchis “llapa runawan ” thakpi kawsananchispaq."
"“Do Not Avenge Yourselves ”" "“Ama [...] vengakuychischu ”"
"What reason to forgo retaliation is found at Romans 12: 19?" "¿Ima willakuymi Romanos 12: 19 textopi tarikun mana vengakunapaq?"
"Paul gives another compelling reason why we should not retaliate; it is the modest course to follow." "Pablon willallantaq huch’uyaykukuq kaymanta, chaymi kinsakaq allin ruway mana vengakuq kanapaq."
"He states: “Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath; for it is written: ‘ Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says Jehovah. ’ ”" "Paymi kayta qelqaran: “Munasqa wawqe - panaykuna, ama qankuna kikiykichisqa vengakuychischu, aswanpas Diosman chaytaqa saqeychis pay muchuchinanpaq."
"A Christian who tries to take revenge is presumptuous." "Diospa Simin Qelqan nin: ‘ Ñoqamanmi tupawan vengakunayqa, ñoqañan kutichipusaq ’ ”, nispa."
"He claims for himself a role that belongs to God." "Vengakuyta munaq runaqa hatunchakushanmi chay ruwayqa Jehová Diosllamanmi tupan."
"Moreover, by taking matters into his own hands, he shows a lack of faith in Jehovah’s assurance: “I will repay. ”" "Hinaspapas, vengakuqqa manan iñinchu “ñoqañan kutichipusaq ” nispa Jehová Diospa nisqanpi."
"In contrast, true Christians trust that Jehovah will “cause justice to be done for his chosen ones. ”" "Cheqaq cristianokunan ichaqa yachanku Jehová Dios ‘ akllakusqankunapaq [...] chaninchapunanta ’."
"They modestly leave the avenging of wrong in God’s hands. ​ — Jeremiah 30: 23, 24; Romans 1: 18." "Huch’uyaykukuqqa Diosmanmi saqen vengakuyta (Jeremías 30: 23, 24; Romanos 1: 18)."
"16, 17. (a) What does it mean to “heap fiery coals ” upon someone’s head?" "16, 17. a) ¿Ima ninanmi ‘ nina sansata uma pataman churay ’?"
"(b) Have you personally observed how kindness softened the heart of an unbeliever? If so, give an example." "b) Sichus yachanki huk cristiano sumaq sonqowan huk runaq sonqonta llanp’uyachisqanta chayqa willay."
"Taking vengeance on an enemy would likely harden his spirit, but treating him with kindness may soften his heart." "Vengakuqqa awqanpa sonqontan rumiyachinman, sumaqwan kutichiqtinmi ichaqa sonqonta llanp’uyachinman."
Why? ¿Imarayku?
"Note Paul’s words to the Christians in Rome." "Chaypaq Roma llaqtapi cristianokunaman Pabloq qelqasqanta qhawarisun: “Awqaykichus yarqachikun chayqa, mikhuchiy, ch’akichikuqtinpas ukyachiy."
"He says: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by doing this you will heap fiery coals upon his head. ”" "Chay hinata ruwaqtiykiqa, nina sansatan uman pataman churanki ”."
"What does this mean?" "¿Ima ninanmi chay simikuna?"
"To “heap fiery coals upon his head ” is a figure of speech drawn from the method of smelting metals in Bible times." "‘ Nina sansata uma pataman ’ churayqa rikch’anachiyllan, chay rimaymi tupan ñawpaq tiempopi metalta unuyachiywan."
"Ore was put into a furnace, and a layer of coals was put not only underneath the ore but also on top of it." "Herreroqa nina sansa patamanmi metalta churaq."
"Fiery coals heaped on top increased the heat so that the hard metal melted and separated from the impurities in the ore." "Hinaspapas astawan unuyananpaqmi metal pataman nina sansata churallaqtaq."
"Similarly, by doing kind deeds to an opposer, we may “melt ” his hardness and bring out his better qualities." "Chhaynallatataqmi allin ruwaykunaqa cheqnikuwaqninchispa sonqonta “unuyachinman ” otaq llanp’uyachinman, sumaq kayninkunatapas rikuchinman (2 Reyes 6: 14 - 23)."
"In fact, numerous members of the Christian congregation were first attracted to true worship by the kind deeds that Jehovah’s servants performed in their behalf." "Sumaq sonqowan Jehová Diospa kamachinkuna tratasqankuraykun kunan askha runakuna Jehová Diospa llaqtanpi kashanku."
"Why We Do Not Retaliate" "Imarayku mana vengakunchischu"
"Why is it right, loving, and modest not to retaliate?" "¿Imaynapin mana vengakuq runa rikuchin allinkaq ruwasqanta, munakuyniyoq kasqanta, huch’uyaykukuq kasqantawan?"
"In this brief consideration of Romans chapter 12, we have seen several important reasons why we “return evil for evil to no one. ”" "Romanos 12 capitulopin yacharunchis kinsa allin ruwaykunamanta, chaykunan yanapawasun ‘ ama pimanpas mana allinmantaqa mana allinllawantaq kutichinapaq ’."
"First, holding back from retaliating is the right course to follow." "Hukninmi allinkaq ruway."
"In view of God’s compassion shown toward us, it is right and reasonable that we offer ourselves to Jehovah and willingly obey his commandments ​ — including the command to love our enemies." "Diospa khuyapayawasqanchisrayku, payman qokunanchis, kamachikuyninkunata kasukunanchis, awqanchiskunatapas munakunanchis."
"Second, refusing to return evil for evil is the loving course to follow." "Iskaykaqpi munakuyta rikuchin."
"By forgoing retaliation and promoting peace, we lovingly hope to help even some fierce opposers to become worshippers of Jehovah." "Thak kayta maskhaspa mana vengakuqtinchisqa ñoqanchis contra hatariq runakunatan yanapasun Jehová Diospa kamachin kanankupaq, chaypin rikuchisun paykuna munakusqanchista."
"Third, refraining from repaying with evil is the modest course to follow." "Kinsakaqpitaq huch’uyaykukuq kayta rikuchin."
"Avenging ourselves would be presumptuous, for Jehovah states: “Vengeance is mine. ”" "Jehová Diosllamanmi tupan vengakuyqa, chaymi nin: “Ñoqañan kutichipusaq ” nispa, chayrayku vengakuqqa hatunchakushan."
"God’s Word also warns: “Has presumptuousness come? Then dishonor will come; but wisdom is with the modest ones. ”" "Ichaqa Diospa Siminmi khaynata anyawanchis: “Pipas anchaykachaqqa p’enqachisqan kapunqa, k’umuykukuqmi ichaqa yachayniyoq kapunqa ”, nispa (Proverbios 11: 2)."
"Wisely leaving the avenging of wrong in God’s hands shows modesty on our part." "Arí, Jehová Diosman vengakuyta saqespaqa yuyayniyoq, huch’uyaykukuq kasqanchistan rikuchisun."
"What will we consider in the following article?" "¿Imamantan qatimuq estudiopi yachasun?"
"Paul sums up his discussion of how we should treat others. He exhorts Christians: “Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good. ”" "Runamasinchista imayna qhawarinamanta yuyaychaspan Pablo niran: “Mana allinkaqwanqa ama atipachikuychu, aswanpas mana allinkaqtaqa allinkaqwan atipay ”, nispa."
"What evil forces are we facing today?" "¿Pikunan kay tiempopi awqanchiskuna?"
"How can we conquer them?" "¿Imaynatan atipasuman?"
"The answers to these and related questions will be considered in the following article." "Chay tapukuykunata huk tapukuykunatawanmi qatimuq estudiopi kutichikunqa."
"Can You Explain?" ¿Kutichiwaqchu?
"• In Romans chapter 12, what admonition is found again and again?" "• ¿Ima ruwaymanta karunchakunanchispaqmi Pablo yuyaychawanchis askha kutita Romanos 12 capitulopi?"

"“Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good. ” ​ — ROMANS 12: 21." "“Mana allinkaqwanqa ama atipachikuychu, aswanpas mana allinkaqtaqa allinkaqwan atipay. ”"

"Is it possible to defeat the forces that try to pull us back into the ungodly world?" "¿Atipasunmanchu millay kawsayman aysawaqninchiskunata, Diosmanta karunchakunanchista munaq awqanchiskunatapas?"
"The answer to both questions is yes!" "Arí, atipasunmanmi."
"Why do we say so?" "¿Imarayku chayta ninchis?"
"Because of what the apostle Paul states in his letter to the Romans. He writes: “Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good. ”" "Roma llaqtapi tiyaq cristianokunaman apóstol Pablo khaynata nisqanrayku: “Mana allinkaqwanqa ama atipachikuychu, aswanpas mana allinkaqtaqa allinkaqwan atipay ”."
"If we trust in Jehovah and are determined not to let the world conquer us, its evil will not overcome us." "Sichus Jehová Diospi hap’ipakusun runakunaq millay ruwayninkunamantapas karunchakusun chayqa, atipasunmi kay pachapi millay ruwaykunata millay runakunatapas."
"Further, the expression “keep conquering the evil ” shows that we can defeat evil if we keep up our spiritual fight against it." "“Mana allinkaqtaqa ” atipashallaypuni nisqa rimaymi rikuchin kallpachakuspa mana allinkaqta atipananchista."
"Only those who let their guard down and cease fighting will be overcome by this wicked world and its evil ruler, Satan the Devil. ​ — 1 John 5: 19." "Pisipaspa mana kallpachakuqkunallan kay millay pachawan aysachikunku, kay pachata kamachiq Satanaspa makinpipas urmanku."
"Why will we consider some events in the life of Nehemiah?" "¿Imamanta yachananchispaqmi Nehemiasmanta yachasun?"
"Some 500 years before Paul’s time, a servant of God living in Jerusalem demonstrated the truth of Paul’s words about the fight against evil." "Pabloq kawsasqanmanta phisqa pachak wata ñawpaqtan Jerusalén llaqtapi Diospa huk kamachin tiyaran, chay runamanta yachaspan mana allinkaq atipaymanta Pabloq qelqasqanta sut’inchasun."
"That man of God, Nehemiah, not only withstood opposition from ungodly people but also conquered evil with good." "Chay runaqa Nehemiasmi karan, payqa manan millay runakunallatachu atiparan mana allinkaqtapas allinkaqwanmi atiparan."

"In what environment did Nehemiah live, and what feat did he accomplish?" "¿Imayna runakuna ukhupin Nehemías tiyaran, ima ancha allin llank’aytan ruwaran?"
"Nehemiah served at the court of King Artaxerxes of Persia." "Nehemiasqa Persia suyupi Artajerjes kamachikuqpa kamachinmi karan."
"Although Nehemiah lived among unbelievers, he did not become “fashioned after ” the“ system of things ” of those days." "Huk dioskunata yupaychaq runakuna ukhupiña tiyaran chaypas, manan ‘ imaynatachus kawsasqankuta hinaqa kawsaranchu ’."
"When a need arose in Judah, he sacrificed his comfortable lifestyle, made the arduous journey to Jerusalem, and took on the huge task of rebuilding the city wall." "Jerusalenpa perqankuna hatarichina kananta yachaspan sumaq kawsayninta saqespa karuta puriran Judá llaqtaman chayananpaq, chaypitaqmi llaqtaq perqankunata sayarichiypi umalliran."
"Even though he was governor of Jerusalem, Nehemiah daily toiled alongside his fellow Israelites “from the ascending of the dawn until the stars came out. ”" "Chay llaqtapi kamachikuqña karan chaypas sapa p’unchaymi “pacha paqariymanta tutayanankama ” israelita wayqenkunawan llank’aran."
"As a result, within only two months, the project was completed!" "Chhaynata llank’aspan iskay killallapi perqayta tukuranku (Nehemías 4: 21; 6: 15)."
"That was an amazing feat, for during the construction work, the Israelites faced various forms of opposition." "Llank’ashantinkun imaymana sasachakuykuna karan, chhaynapi tarikushaspapas ratulla perqa sayarichisqankuqa ancha allinpunin karan."
"Who were Nehemiah’s opposers, and what was their goal?" "¿Pikunan Nehemiaspa awqankuna karan, imatan munaranku?"
"What was the goal of Nehemiah’s opposers?" "¿Imatan munaranku Nehemiaspa awqankuna?"
"The main opposers were Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem, influential men living near Judah." "Judá llaqtaq qayllanpi tiyaq Sanbalat, Tobías, Guésem atiyniyoq runakunan Nehemiaspa awqankuna karan."
"Since they were enemies of God’s people, “it seemed to them something very bad that [Nehemiah] had come to seek something good for the sons of Israel. ”" "Kay awqakunan ‘ Israel runakunaq allinninpaq [Nehemiás] Jerusalenman chayasqanta yachaspanku, sinchita phiñakurqanku ’ (Nehemías 2: 10, 19)."
"Nehemiah’s enemies were bent on stopping Nehemiah’s building plans, even resorting to evil schemes." "Nehemiaspa perqa sayarichisqanta qolluchiyta munaspan chay runakunaqa imaymana millay ruwaykunata ruwaranku. ¿Iman sucederan?"
"Would Nehemiah ‘ let himself be conquered by evil ’?" "¿Atipachikunmanchu Nehemías ‘ mana allinkaqwan ’?"
"“Angry and Highly Offended ”" "“Sinchita phiñakurqan, sonqonpas rawrarirqanraq ”"
"5, 6. (a) How did Nehemiah’s enemies react to the building work?" "5, 6. a) ¿Ima nirankun Nehemiasta awqankuna perqa sayarichisqankumanta?"
"(b) Why was Nehemiah not intimidated by opposers?" "b) ¿Imaraykun Nehemías mana manchakuranchu awqankunata?"
"Nehemiah courageously exhorted his people: “Let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem. ”" "Nehemiasmi allin kallpawan llaqtata niran: “Jerusalenpa muyuriq perqanta sayarichisun ” nispa, paykunataq kutichiranku:“ ¡Sayarichisunchis, llank’asunchis! ”"
"They replied: “We must build. ”" nispa.
"Nehemiah notes: “They strengthened their hands for the good work, ” but opposers“ began to deride us and look on us despisingly and say: ‘ What is this thing that you are doing?" "Nehemías willan: “Paykunataq kallpachanakurqanku allin yuyaykusqankuman hina llank’anankupaq ”. Willallantaq awqankunaq imayna kutichisqanta:“ Yacharqospankutaq ñoqaykumanta asikurqanku."
"Is it against the king that you are rebelling? ’ ”" "Pisichawaspankutaq niwarqanku: ¿Imatataq qankunari ruwashankichis?"
"Nehemiah was not intimidated by their taunts and false accusations." "¿Rey contrachu sayarishankichis? ” nispa."
"He told the opposers: “The God of the heavens is the One that will grant us success, and we ourselves, his servants, shall get up, and we must build. ”" "Asipayasqankuta, yanqamanta tunpasqankutawan mana kasuspan Nehemías kutichiran: “Hanaq Pacha Diosmi tukunaykukama yanapawanqaku ”, nispa (Nehemías 2: 17 - 20)."
"Nehemiah was determined to push forward with “the good work. ”" "Nehemiasqa manan chay allin ‘ llank’anata ’ saqeyta munaranchu."
"One of those opposers, Sanballat, “became angry and highly offended ” and stepped up his verbal barrage." "Hukninkaq awqan Sanbalatmi “sinchita phiñakurqan, sonqonpas rawrarirqanraq ”, chaymi astawanraq k’amiran."
"“What are the feeble Jews doing? ”" "nispa, chaymantan nillarantaq: “¿Chay k’urpa montonmanta ruphasqa rumikunatapas horqonkumanchu? ”"

"Tobiah joined in the jeering, saying: “If a fox went up against it, he would certainly break down their wall of stones. ”" "Tobiaspas k’iriq simiwanmi nillarantaq: “Mayqen atoqllapas seqarqospaqa thunirparinqan ”, nispa (Nehemías 4: 1 - 3)."
"How did Nehemiah react?" "¿Imatan ruwaran Nehemías?"
"In what ways did Nehemiah react to the accusations of his opposers?" "¿Imatan Nehemías ruwaran awqankuna k’amiqtin?"
"Nehemiah simply ignored the mockery. He followed God’s command and did not seek to retaliate." "Nehemiasqa manan kasuranchu asipayasqankuta, manataqmi vengakuranchu Diospa kamachikusqanta kasukuspa (Levítico 19: 18)."
"Rather, he left the matter in Jehovah’s hands and prayed: “Hear, O our God, for we have become an object of contempt; and make their reproach return upon their own head. ”" "Jehová Diosmanmi saqeran vengakuyta, mañakurantaq: “¡Diosniyku, uyariy khaynata pisichawasqankuta!"
"Nehemiah trusted in Jehovah’s assurance: “Vengeance is mine, and retribution. ”" "Paykunaman kutichiy k’amiwasqankuta ”, nispa (Nehemías 4: 4)."
"Further, Nehemiah and his people “kept building the wall. ”" "Ñawpaqtaraqmi Jehová Dios kayta nisqa: “Ñoqan awqakunata vengakuqqa kani, ñoqan chaskinanta pagaqqa kani ”, nispa (Deuteronomio 32: 35)."
"They did not let themselves become sidetracked." "Chay simikunapin Nehemiasqa tukuy sonqonwan hap’ipakuran."
"In fact, “the entire wall came to be joined together clear to half its height, and the people continued to have a heart for working. ”" "Chayraykun Nehemiasqa mana imata manchakuspa israelitakunawan kuska ‘ tukuy sonqo llank’ashallarqanku, chaymi kuskan perqakama sayarichirqanku. ’ (Nehemías 4: 6.)"
"The enemies of true worship had failed to halt the building work!" "Awqakunaqa manan israelitakunaq perqasqanta qolluchiyta atirankuchu."
"How can we imitate Nehemiah?" "¿Imaynapin Nehemías hina kasunman?"
"(a) How might we imitate Nehemiah when opposers falsely accuse us?" "a) Yanqamanta tunpawaqtinchis, ¿imatan ruwananchis Nehemías hina?"
"(b) Relate an experience you have had or heard about that shows the wisdom of not retaliating." "b) Willay imakunapin yanaparasunki mana vengakuq kasqayki, huk cristianomanta yachaspapas willay."
"Today, opposers at school, at work, or even at home may hurl taunts and accusations at us." "Yaqapaschá pipas escuelapi, llank’anapi, otaq wasipipas asipayawasunman otaq yanqamanta tunpawasunman."
"However, often such false charges are best handled by applying the Scriptural principle: “There is... a time to keep quiet. ”" "Mayninpiqa aswan allinmi kanman “kanmi upallakuna tiempo ” nispa Bibliaq nisqanta kasukuy (Eclesiastés 3: 1, 7)."
"Hence, like Nehemiah, we refrain from retaliating with cutting words." "Chayrayku Nehemías hina mana k’arak simiwanchu kutichinchis."
"We turn to God in prayer, trusting the one who assures us: “I will repay. ”" "Aswanmi “ñoqañan kutichipusaq ” nispa Jehová Diospa nisqanpi hap’ipakunchis."
"In that way, we do not let our opposers sidetrack us from the spiritual work that is to be carried out today ​ — the preaching of the good news of God’s Kingdom and the making of disciples." "Chaymi awqanchiskunata mana kasuspa Diospa Reinonmanta allin willakuykunata predicashanchis, runakunatapas yanapashanchis Jesuspa qatikuqnin kanankupaq."
"Each time we participate in the preaching work and refuse to be deterred by opposition, we show the same faithful spirit that Nehemiah did." "Cheqnikuwanchisña chaypas sapa kutilla predicasqanchiswanmi rikuchishanchis Nehemías hina kasqanchista."
"‘ We Shall Certainly Kill You ’" "“Wañurqachisunchis ”"
"What form of opposition did Nehemiah’s enemies unleash, and how did Nehemiah respond?" "¿Imatan Nehemiaspa awqankuna ruwallarankutaq, imatan Nehemías ruwaran?"
"When opposers of true worship in Nehemiah’s time heard that “the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem had gone forward, ” they took up their swords to“ fight against Jerusalem. ”" "‘ Jerusalén perqata usqhaylla sayarichishasqankuta ’ yacharuspan awqankunaqa espadankuta hap’ispa ‘ Jerusalenta phawaykuranku ’."
"For the Jews the situation looked gloomy. There were Samaritans in the north, Ammonites in the east, Arabs in the south, and Ashdodites in the west." "Judiokunaqa sinchi sasachakuypin tarikuranku, wichay ladopin tiyaranku samaritanokuna; inti lloqsimuy ladopi ammonitakuna; uray ladopi árabe runakuna; inti haykuy ladopitaq asdodita runakuna."
"Jerusalem was surrounded; the builders appeared to be trapped!" "Jerusalenqa chay llaqtakunaq chawpinpin tarikuran, chaymi llank’aqkunaqa wisq’asqa hina kasharanku."
"What were they to do?" "¿Imatan ruwaranku?"
"“We prayed to our God, ” says Nehemiah." "Nehemiasmi nin: “Diosniykumanta mañakurqayku ”, nispa."
"The enemies threatened: “We shall certainly kill them and put a stop to the work. ”" "Awqakunan khaynata niranku: “Wañurqachisunchis chay llank’ananku qollunanpaq ”, nispa."
"Nehemiah responded by assigning the builders the task of defending the city “with their swords, their lances and their bows. ”" "Chayta uyarispan Nehemías llank’aqkunata kamachiran ‘ espadata, lanzata, p’eqtata ’ hap’ispa llaqtankuta amachanankupaq."
"True, humanly speaking, the small band of Jews did not stand a chance against the overwhelming enemy forces, but Nehemiah urged them: “Do not be afraid..." "Chay pisi t’aqa judiokunaqa manan paykunallamanta chay kallpasapa awqakunata atipayta atinkumanchu karan."
"Jehovah the great and the fear - inspiring One keep in your mind. ” ​ — Nehemiah 4: 7 - 9, 11, 13, 14." "Nehemiasmi ichaqa khaynata kallpacharan: “Ama manchakuychischu, yuyariychis Diosninchisqa hatunmi, manchanataq [kanpas] ”, nispa (Nehemías 4: 7 - 9, 11, 13, 14)."
"(a) What caused a sudden turn of events among Nehemiah’s enemies?" "a) ¿Imarayku Nehemiaspa awqankuna qonqayllamanta kutiripuranku?"
"(b) What measures did Nehemiah take?" "b) ¿Imatan Nehemías ruwaran awqakunaq kutimunanta yachaspa?"
"Now there was a sudden turn of events." "Qonqayllamantan awqankuna kutiripuranku."
Why? ¿Imarayku?
"“The true God had frustrated their counsel, ” reports Nehemiah." "Nehemiasmi nin: ‘ Contraykupi yuyaykusqankutan Dios qolluchiran ’, nispa."
"However, Nehemiah realized that the enemies remained a threat. Therefore, he prudently adjusted the work method of the builders." "Chaypas Nehemiasqa yacharanmi awqankunaq kutimunanta, chaymi allinta yuyaykuspa hukniraymanta llank’achiran."
"From then on, “each one was active in the work with his one hand while the other hand was holding the missile. ”" "Chaymantapachan ‘ huk makiwan llank’aranku, hukkaq makiwantaq armata hap’iranku ’."
"Nehemiah also assigned a man who in case of an enemy attack would “blow the horn ” to warn the builders." "Huk runatataq churaran awqakuna hamuqtin ‘ trompetata tocananpaq ’."
"Above all, Nehemiah reassured the people: “Our God himself will fight for us. ”" "Ichaqa kay simikunawanmi israelitakunata astawan kallpacharan: “Diosninchismi ñoqanchisrayku maqanakunqa ”, nispa (Nehemías 4: 15 - 20)."
"Encouraged and prepared to deal with aggression, the builders kept working." "Chaymi paykunaqa llank’ashallaranku, awqanku hamuqtin maqanakunankupaqtaq kallpachasqa listollaña kasharanku."
"What lessons can we draw from this account?" "¿Imatan chay willakuymanta yachanchis?"
"What enables true Christians to withstand evil in lands where the Kingdom work is banned, and how do they conquer evil with good?" "¿Pimanmi cheqaq cristianokuna asuykunku Reinomanta predicayta hark’asqanku llaqtakunapi mana allinkaqta atipanankupaq, imatan ruwanku mana allinkaqta allinkaqwan atipanankupaq?"
"At times, true Christians face violent opposition." "Cheqaq cristianokunapas sinchi qatiykachasqan tarikunkuman."
"In fact, in some lands vicious opposers of true worship form an overwhelming enemy force." "Wakin suyukunapin Jehová Diospa llaqtanpa awqankuna sinchi millay kanku."
"Humanly speaking, our fellow believers in those lands do not stand a chance." "Runakunaq qhawarisqanman hinaqa manan wayqe pananchiskuna chay awqakunata atipayta atinkumanchu."
"Nevertheless, those Witnesses are confident that ‘ God will fight for them. ’" "Chay Testigokunan ichaqa ‘ Dios paykunarayku maqanakunanpi ’ suyakunku."
"Indeed, those who are persecuted for their beliefs have time and again experienced that Jehovah answers their prayers and ‘ frustrates the counsel ’ of powerful enemies." "Iñiyninkurayku qatiykachasqa cristianokunaqa yachankun mañakusqankuman hina Jehová Diospa kutichinanta, ancha atiyniyoq awqakunaq yuyaykusqanta qolluchinantapas."
"Even in countries where the Kingdom work is banned, Christians find ways to keep on preaching the good news." "Reinomanta predicayta hark’asqanku llaqtakunapipas allin yuyaywanmi allichakunku predicashanallankupaq."
"Just as the builders in Jerusalem adjusted their work method, so Jehovah’s Witnesses today prudently adjust their preaching methods when under attack." "Ñawpaqpi yachasqanchis hina Jerusalenpa perqankunata hatarichiqkunaqa hukniraymantan llank’ananku karan."
"Of course, they refrain from using physical weapons." "Chhaynatan Jehová Diospa testigonkunapas qatiykachasqa tarikuspaqa mana ima armata hap’ispa allichakunku hukniraymanta predicanankupaq."
"Even the threat of physical violence does not make them halt their preaching activities." "Imata ruwanankupaqña manchachinku chaypas predicashallankun."
"On the contrary, those courageous brothers and sisters “keep conquering the evil with the good. ”" "Paykunaqa mana manchakuspan ‘ mana allinkaqta allinkaqwan atipashallanku ’."
"“Come, and Let Us Meet ”" "“Hamuy [...] huñukusun ”"
"12, 13. (a) What strategy did Nehemiah’s opposers employ?" "12, 13. a) ¿Ima millay ruwaywanmi awqankuna Nehemiasta urmachiyta munaranku?"
"(b) Why did Nehemiah turn down the invitation to meet his opposers?" "b) ¿Imarayku Nehemías mana kasukuranchu awqankunaq waqyachisqanta?"
"After Nehemiah’s enemies realized that their open assaults had failed, they turned to more subtle forms of opposition. In fact, they tried three schemes." "Nehemiaspa llank’achisqanta mana qolluchiyta atispan, awqankuna hukniraymantañataq yuyaykuranku, kinsa millay ruwaykunatan yuyaykuranku."
"What were they?" ¿Imakunata?
"First, Nehemiah’s enemies tried to deceive him. They told him: “Come, and let us meet together by appointment in the villages of the valley plain of Ono. ”" "Ñawpaqkaqpi, Nehemiasta q’otuyta munaranku kayta nispa: “Hamuy Ono pampa nisqapi hukkaq llaqtachapi huñukusun ”."
"Ono lay between Jerusalem and Samaria." "Ono llaqtan tarikuran Jerusalén llaqtaq Samaria llaqtaq kuskanninpi, paykunan Nehemiasta nisharanku chay cheqaspi huñukuspa rimanakunankupaq."
"So the enemies proposed that Nehemiah meet them halfway to resolve the differences." "Khaynatapaschá Nehemiasqa yuyaykunman karan: “Maqanakunaykumantaqa aswanpas rimanakamusaq ”, nispa."
"Nehemiah could have thought: ‘ That sounds reasonable." "Ichaqa manan kasukuranchu, yacharanmi ‘ mana allin ruwanankupaq waqyachisqankuta ’."
"It is better to talk than to fight. ’ But Nehemiah refused." "Payqa q’otusqankutan repararan, chaymi tawa kutita kutichiran: “Manan tiempoy kanchu qankunawan huñunakunaypaq."
"He explained why: “They were scheming to do me harm. ”" "Llank’anaymi saqeykuqtiyqa qollunman ”, nispa."
"The enemies ’ attempts to get Nehemiah to compromise failed. He kept his eye focused on the building work. ​ — Nehemiah 6: 1 - 4." "Nehemiastaqa manan awqankuna urmachiyta atirankuchu, paytaqmi llank’ashallaran (Nehemías 6: 1 - 4)."
"How did Nehemiah react to his false accusers?" "¿Imanispan Nehemías kutichiran yanqamanta tunpasqankuman?"
"Second, Nehemiah’s enemies resorted to spreading false rumors, accusing Nehemiah of “scheming to rebel ” against King Artaxerxes." "Iskaykaqpi, Nehemiasmantan llullakuspa rimakacharanku, tunparankutaqmi, kamachikuq Artajerjes ‘ contranpin sayarishan ’, nispa."
"Once more, Nehemiah was told: “Let us consult together. ”" "Yapamanta nillarankutaq: ‘ rimanakusunchis ’, nispa."
"Again Nehemiah refused, for he discerned the enemies ’ intention." "Yuyaykusqankuta reparaspan Nehemiasqa mana kasukullarantaqchu."
"Nehemiah explained: “All of them were trying to make us afraid, saying: ‘ Their hands will drop down from the work so that it will not be done. ’ ”" "Nehemiasmi nin: “Paykunaqa llapankun yuyaykurqanku: Mancharichispa pisi kallpayachisunchis llank’asqankuta ama tukunankupaq ”, nispa."
"This time, however, Nehemiah did rebut his enemies ’ accusation, stating: “Things such as you are saying have not been brought about, but it is out of your own heart that you are inventing them. ”" "Kay kutipin ichaqa Nehemías yanqa tunpasqankumanta kayta kutichiran: “Rimasqaykiqa manan cheqaqchu, qanmi chaytaqa sonqoykimanta horqospa rimashanki ”, nispa."
"Moreover, Nehemiah turned to Jehovah for support, praying: “Strengthen my hands. ”" "Hinaspapas Jehová Diosta mañakuran yanapananpaq."
"He trusted that with Jehovah’s help, he would be able to foil this evil plot and push forward with the building project. ​ — Nehemiah 6: 5 - 9." "Khaynata valekuran: “Kallpachaway llank’anaypaq ” nispa, chaywanmi Nehemiasqa Jehová Diosta mañakusharan awqankunaq tunpasqanta mana kasuspa llank’ashanallankupaq (Nehemías 6: 5 - 9)."
"What recommendation did a false prophet make, and why did Nehemiah not accept the recommendation?" "¿Imata ruwananpaqmi Semaya Nehemiasta yuyaycharan, imarayku mana kasuranchu chay llulla profetaq nisqanta?"
"Third, Nehemiah’s enemies used a traitor, the Israelite Shemaiah, to try to make Nehemiah break God’s Law." "Kinsakaqpitaq, Nehemías Diospa kamachikuynin contra huchallikunanpaq Semaya israelitata lluk’iykuranku q’otunanpaq."
"Shemaiah said to Nehemiah: “Let us meet by appointment at the house of the true God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple; for they are coming in to kill you. ”" "Semayan Nehemiasta niran: “Diospa wasinpi huñukusun, ch’uya cheqasman haykuspa punkuta allinta wisq’akamusun, kunan tutan wañuchiq hamusunkiku ”, nispa."
"Shemaiah said that Nehemiah was about to be assassinated but that he could save his life by hiding in the temple." "Nehemiastan niran mana wañuchisqa kananpaq yupaychana wasipi pakakunanta."
"However, Nehemiah was not a priest. He would commit a sin by hiding in the house of God." "Nehemiasqa manataq sacerdotechu karan chayqa, huchallikunmanmi karan yupaychana wasipi pakakuspa."
"Would he break God’s Law in an attempt to save his life?" "¿P’akinmanchu Diospa kamachikuyninta mana wañuchinankurayku?"
"Nehemiah responded: “Who is there like me that could enter into the temple and live?" "¿Diospa wasinmanpas haykunmanchu kawsayninta qespichinanpaq?"
"I shall not enter! ”" "¡Manan, manan haykuymanchu! ” nispa."
"Why did Nehemiah not fall into the trap that had been set for him?" "¿Imaynapin Nehemías mana urmaranchu chay toqllaman?"
"Because he knew that although Shemaiah was a fellow Israelite, “it was not God that had sent him. ” After all, a true prophet would never advise him to break God’s Law." "Semaya runa llaqtamasinña karan chaypas Nehemiasmi reparasqa “Diospa mana kamachisqanchu rimashasqanta ”, Diospa cheqaq profetanqa manan hayk’aqpas Diospa kamachikuyninta p’akinanpaq yuyaychanmanchu."
"Again, Nehemiah did not let himself be conquered by evil opposers." "Chhaynapin Nehemiasqa yapamanta millay awqankunata atiparan."
"Shortly thereafter he could report: “At length the wall came to completion on the twenty - fifth day of Elul, in fifty - two days. ” ​ — Nehemiah 6: 10 - 15; Numbers 1: 51; 18: 7." "Chay qhepamantaq kayta willaran: “Elul killaq iskay chunka phisqayoq p’unchayninpin muyuriq perqa sayarichisqa tukukurqan, phisqa chunka iskayniyoq p’unchaypi ”, nispa (Nehemías 6: 10 - 15; Números 1: 51; 18: 7)."
"(a) How should we deal with false friends, false accusers, and false brothers?" "a) ¿Imatan ruwananchis iskay uya amigokuna, yanqamanta tunpawaqninchiskuna, wayqe panaman tukuqkunapas mana urmachiwananchispaq?"
"(b) How do you show that you refuse to compromise your beliefs at home, at school, or at work?" "b) ¿Imaynatan rikuchinchis wasipi, escuelapi, llank’anapipas iñiyninchispi qaqa sayasqanchista?"
"Like Nehemiah, we too might face opposers in the form of false friends, false accusers, and false brothers." "Nehemiasta hinan ñoqanchistapas iskay uya amigokuna, yanqamanta tunpawaqninchiskuna, wayqe panakunaman tukuqkunapas urmachiyta munawasunman."
"Some individuals may invite us to meet them halfway, so to speak." "Wakinqa iñiyninchispin waqllichiwasunman."
"They may try to convince us that if we serve Jehovah with a little less zeal, we could pursue worldly goals at the same time." "Niwasunmanpaschá, manachu Jehová Diospa munaynin ruwasqaykimanta tiempoykita t’aqawaq ima munasqaykitapas aypanaykipaq, nispa."
"However, because God’s Kingdom comes first in our lives, we refuse to compromise." "Ichaqa manan uyariqpas tukunchischu Diospa Reinonta ñawpaqman churasqanchisrayku."
"Opposers also spread false accusations against us." "Cristianokunapas yanqamanta tunpasqan kanchis."
"In some lands we are accused of posing a threat to the State, just as Nehemiah was accused of rebelling against the king." "Imaynan Nehemiasta tunparanku, kamachikuqpa contranpi sayarin nispa, chhaynatan ñoqanchistapas wakin suyukunapi tunpawanchis, kamachikuqpa contranpin sayarishanku, nispa."
"Some accusations have been successfully rebutted in judicial courts." "Mayninqa yanqamanta tunpawasqanchistan tribunalkunapi sut’inchakun maynintaq ichaqa mana."
"But whatever the outcome in individual situations, we confidently pray that Jehovah will direct matters according to his will." "Imaynaña kaqtinpas Jehová Diosmantan mañakushallanchis paypa munasqanman hina imapas ruwakunanpaq."
"Opposition may also come from those who pretend to serve Jehovah." "Jehová Diospa kamachinman tukuq runakunapas urmachiytan munawasunman."
"Just as a fellow Jew tried to persuade Nehemiah to break God’s Law to save his life, so apostate former Witnesses may try to influence us to compromise in one way or another." "Imaynan Nehemiasta huk llaqtamasin urmachiyta munaran Diospa kamachikuyninta p’akinanpaq, chhaynatan ñoqanchistapas Diospa llaqtanmanta t’aqakuq runa imapipas urmachiyta munawasunman."
"However, we reject apostates because we know that our lives are saved, not by breaking God’s laws, but by keeping them!" "Diospa kamachikuyninkunata p’akispaqa manan wiñaypaqchu kawsasunman, chaymi Diosmanta t’aqakuq runataqa mana uyarinchischu."
"Yes, with Jehovah’s help we can conquer any form of evil." "Arí, Jehová Diospa yanapayninwanmi mana allinkaqkunata atipasun."
"Sharing Good News Despite Facing Evil" "Mana allinkaqkuna ukhupiña tiyanchis chaypas predicashallanchismi"
"17, 18. (a) What do Satan and his agents endeavor to achieve?" "17, 18. a) ¿Imatan Satanaspas yanapaqninkunapas munanku?"
"(b) What are you determined to do, and why?" "b) ¿Imata ruwananchispaqmi yuyaykunchisña, imarayku chayta yuyaykunchis?"
"God’s Word states regarding Christ’s anointed brothers: “They conquered [Satan] because... of the word of their witnessing. ”" "Hawisqa wayqe panakunamantan Diospa Simin nin: ‘ Diospa siminta willasqankuwanmi dragonta [Satanasta] atiparqanku ’, nispa."
"Hence, there is a direct connection between conquering Satan ​ — the source of evil — ​ and preaching the Kingdom message." "Arí, Reinomanta allin willakuykunata predicasqanchiswanmi mana allinkaqta paqarichiq Satanasta atipanchis."
"No wonder that Satan relentlessly attacks both the anointed remnant and the “great crowd ” by stirring up opposition! ​ — Revelation 7: 9; 12: 17." "Chayrayku Satanasqa hawisqa cristianokunata ‘ ancha askha runakunatapas ’ qatiykachachiwanchis."
"As we have seen, opposition may come in the form of verbal attacks or threats of physical violence or in more subtle forms." "Yacharunchismi yanqa tunpaykunawan, manchachiykunawan, imaymanakunapiwan Satanaspa qatiykachawasqanchista."
"In any case, Satan’s goal is always the same ​ — to put a stop to the preaching work." "Chaykunawanmi Satanasqa predicacionta qolluchiyta munan."
"However, he will fail miserably because in imitation of Nehemiah of old, God’s people are determined to “keep conquering the evil with the good. ”" "Ichaqa manan atinqachu, ñan Diospa llaqtanqa Nehemías hina ‘ mana allinkaqta allinkaqwan atipananpaq ’ yuyaykunña."
"They will do so by keeping up the preaching of the good news until Jehovah says that the work is done! ​ — Mark 13: 10; Romans 8: 31; Philippians 1: 27, 28." "Chayrayku chhayna kananpaq predicashallasun Jehová Diospa niwasqanchis p’unchaykama."

"Can a Christian actually sin against God’s holy spirit, or active force?" "¿Huk cristiano Diospa santo espiritun contra huchallikunmanchu?"
"Yes, it is possible to sin against Jehovah’s holy spirit." "Diospa Simin Qelqaqa willawanchismi Jehová Diospa santo espiritun contra huchallikuymanta."
"“Every sort of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, ” said Jesus Christ,“ but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven. ”" "Jesusmi niran: “Diosmi runakunaq ima huchantapas tukuy mana allin rimaywan k’amisqankutapas pampachanqa, pipas Santo Espíritu contra mana allinta rimaspa pisichaqmi ichaqa mana hayk’aqpas pampachasqachu kanqa ”, nispa."
"We are warned: “If we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left, but there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment. ”" "Bibliaqa willallantaqmi: “Cheqaq - kayta reqsishaspanchisñachus yuyaymantapuni huchallikusunchis chayqa, manan hucha pampachaq sacrificio kanñachu, aswanpas manchay - manchay hatun juiciollañan suyawanchis ”, nispa."
"And the apostle John wrote: “There is a sin that does incur death. ”" "Apóstol Juanpas niranmi: “Kanmi wañuyman aysaykuq hucha ”, nispa."

"Jehovah is the final Judge of wrongdoers." "Jehová Diosmi kay pachantin Juezqa."
"Indeed, all of us must render an account to him, and he always does what is right." "Llapanchismi payman cuentata qosunchis, payqa chanin kaqtapunin ruwan (Génesis 18: 25; Romanos 14: 12)."
"Jehovah determines whether we have committed an unforgivable sin, and he can withdraw his spirit from us." "Jehová Diosllan nin pikunachus mana pampachana huchaman urmasqanchista, payllan chay huchaman urmasqanchismantapas santo espiritunta qechuwasunman (Salmo 51: 11)."
"However, if we are deeply grieved over a sin we have committed, it is very likely that we are truly repentant." "Sichus huchaman urmasqanchismanta khuyayta llakikushanchis chayqa, cheqaqtan pesapakushanchisman."
"What, though, is genuine repentance?" "¿Imataq cheqaq pesapakuyri?"
"(a) How would you define repentance?" "a) ¿Imataq pesapakuyri?"
"(b) What is so comforting about Psalm 103: 10 - 14?" "b) ¿Imarayku kallpachawanchis Salmo 103: 10 - 14 textoq nisqan?"
"To repent means that we change our attitude toward past or intended wrongdoing." "Pesapakuyqa huchaman urmasqamanta khuyayta llakikuymi, huchata saqespa Diosman kutirikuymi."
"It means that we feel sorrow or regret and turn away from a sinful course. If we have sinned seriously but have taken the necessary steps to show that we have really repented, we can draw comfort from the psalmist’s words: “He [Jehovah] has not done to us even according to our sins; nor according to our errors has he brought upon us what we deserve." "Sichus hatun huchaman urmasqanchismanta cheqaqtapuni pesapakuranchis, chay huchatapas saqeranchistaq chayqa, kallpachawanchismi salmistaq nisqan: “Manan mana chanin ruwasqanchiskunaman hinachu ñoqanchistaqa muchuchiwanchis, manan huchanchiskunaman hinapaschu pagawanchis."

"Comforting, too, are the apostle John’s words: “By this we shall know that we originate with the truth, and we shall assure our hearts before him as regards whatever our hearts may condemn us in, because God is greater than our hearts and knows all things." "Kallpachallawanchistaqmi apóstol Juanpa nisqan, paymi niran: “Chay hinapin yachanchis cheqaq - kaypi kashasqanchista, chaymi Diospa ñawpaqenpiqa mana manchakusunchischu, sonqonchisña imamanta huchachawaqtinchispas."

"Our heart will “not condemn us ” if we trust in Jehovah, display brotherly love, and are not guilty of practicing deliberate sin." "Payqa yachanmi ‘ wayqe - panapura ch’uya sonqowan munanakusqanchista ’, huchamanta karunchakusqanchista, munayninta ruwanapaq kallpachakusqanchistapas, chaymi khuyapayawanchis."

"What determines whether a sin is forgivable or not?" "¿Imaynapi yachakunman ima huchapas pampachanaraqchus icha manañachus chayta?"
"What sins are not forgiven?" "¿Ima huchakunataq mana pampachana kanman?"
"To answer this question, let us consider some Biblical examples." "Chayta yachanapaq Bibliapi ejemplokunata qhawarisun."
"This should prove comforting to us if we are repentant but are still sorely distressed over our serious errors." "Chaykunamanta yachaymi kallpachawasunchis sichus hatun huchaman urmasqanchismanta pesapakuspaña sinchitaraq llakikushanchis chayqa."
"We will see that it is not so much a matter of what kind of sin a person has committed; rather, it is the motive, the heart condition, and the degree of willfulness involved that determines whether a sin is forgivable or not." "Chaypi kayta yachasunchis: Hucha pampachasqa otaq mana pampachasqa kananpaqqa manan hucha ruwakusqallantachu qhawarikunan, aswanpas qhawarikunan imarayku runa huchallikusqanta, sonqon imayna kasqanta, maykama huchallikusqantapas."
"How did some first - century Jewish religious leaders sin against the holy spirit?" "¿Imaynatan judío umallikuna santo espirituq contranpi huchallikuranku?"
"First - century Jewish religious leaders who maliciously opposed Jesus Christ were sinning against the holy spirit." "Ñawpaq kaq siglopi Jesuspa contranpi churakuq judío umallikunaqa santo espirituq contranpi huchallikuranku."
"They saw God’s spirit at work in Jesus as he performed miracles that honored Jehovah." "Jesusqa Diospa espiritunwanmi milagrokunata ruwaran Jehová Diosta hatunchananpaq."
"Yet, these enemies of Christ attributed this power to Satan the Devil." "Chaywanpas, chay judiokunaqa niranku: Satanaspa atiyninwanmi chay milagrokunata ruwashan, nispa."
"According to Jesus, those who thus blasphemed against God’s holy spirit were thereby committing a sin that would not be forgiven in the present “system of things nor in that to come. ” ​ — Matthew 12: 22 - 32." "Jesuspa nisqan hina, Diospa santo espiritun contra mana allinta rimaspa pisichaqkunaqa manan pampachasqachu kanqaku, ‘ aswanmi wiñaypaq huchayoq kapunku ’."
"What is blasphemy, and what did Jesus say about it?" "¿Iman mana allinta rimaspa pisichay, imanirantaq Jesús chaymanta?"
"Blasphemy is defamatory, injurious, or abusive speech." "Dios contra otaq runa contra mana allinta rimaspa pisichayqa yanqamanta tumpaymi, k’arak simikunawan k’amiymi."
"Since the holy spirit has God as its Source, saying things against his spirit is the same as speaking against Jehovah." "Diosmantataq santo espíritu paqarimun chayqa, chay espíritu contra rimayqa Dios contra rimayllataqmi."
"Unrepentantly resorting to speech of that kind is unforgivable." "Chay huchaman urmaspa mana pesapakuqkunaqa manan pampachasqachu kanqaku."
"Jesus ’ words about such sin show that Jesus is referring to those who willfully oppose the operation of God’s holy spirit." "Wakin runakunaqa yuyaypipuni Diospa santo espiritun contra churakuranku, chaymi Jesús rimaran mana pampachana huchamanta."
"Because Jehovah’s spirit was at work in Jesus but his opposers ascribed this power to the Devil, they sinfully blasphemed against the spirit." "Cristoq awqankunaqa repararankun Jehová Diospa espiritunwan Jesús milagrokuna ruwasqanta, chaywanpas niranku: Saqraq atiyninwanmi ruwashan, nispa."
"Hence, Jesus declared: “Whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit has no forgiveness forever, but is guilty of everlasting sin. ” ​ — Mark 3: 20 - 29." "Jesusmi chaymanta niran: “Pipas Santo Espíritu contra mana allinta rimaspa pisichaqmi ichaqa mana hayk’aqpas pampachasqachu kanqa, aswanmi wiñaypaq huchayoq kapun ”, nispa."
"Why did Jesus call Judas “the son of destruction ”?" "¿Imaraykun Jesús Judasta suticharan ‘ chinkananpuni kaq runa ’, nispa?"
"Consider also the case of Judas Iscariot." "Kunanqa rimasun Judas Iscariotemanta."
"He pursued a dishonest course, stealing from the money box entrusted to his care." "Judasmanqa qolqe churana cajatan hap’ichiranku, ichaqa suwakullaqpuni kasqa."
"Judas later went to the Jewish rulers and arranged to betray Jesus for 30 pieces of silver." "Qhepamantaq Judasqa judío kamachikuqkunawan rimanakuran 30 qolqerayku Jesusta hap’ichinanpaq."
"Yes, Judas felt remorse after the betrayal, but he never repented of his deliberate sin." "Chay ruwasqanmanta sonqonña huchacharan chaypas manapunin pesapakuranchu."
"Consequently, Judas is not worthy of a resurrection. Jesus therefore called him “the son of destruction. ” ​ — John 17: 12; Matthew 26: 14 - 16." "Chayraykun Judasqa mana kawsarichisqachu kanqa, chaymi Jesús suticharan ‘ chinkananpuni kaq runa ’, nispa."

"How did King David sin in connection with Bath - sheba, and what comfort may be drawn from the way God dealt with them?" "¿Ima huchakunaman David urmaran? ¿Imaynatan kallpachawanchis paykunata Diospa pampachasqanmanta yachay?"
"Occasionally, Christians who have confessed their serious sin and who have received spiritual help from congregation elders may still be plagued by concern over past transgressions of God’s law." "Huk cristiano hatun huchaman urmasqanmanta willakunña congregacionpi ancianokunaman, paykunataq yanaparanku Diosman kutirikunanpaq, chaywanpas chay cristianoqa sinchitaraq nanachikushan huchallikusqanmanta."

"King David sinned gravely in connection with Bath - sheba, the wife of Uriah." "Ñawpaqta yachasun Davidmanta, paymi Uriaspa warmin Bat - sebawan wasanchay huchata ruwaran."
"Having seen this beautiful woman bathing as he looked down from his nearby rooftop, David had her brought to his palace and had sexual relations with her." "Davidmi wasi patamanta rikuran sumaq rikch’ayniyoq warmi bañakushaqta, hinaspa kamachiran payman pusaykunankupaq, chay warmiwantaq puñuran."
"Later informed that she was pregnant, he schemed to have her husband, Uriah, sleep with her to cover up the adultery." "Chay qhepamantaq warmiqa onqoq qheparan, chayta yachaspataq Davidqa huchanta pakayta munaspa Uriasta waqyachimuran Bat - sebawan puñunanpaq."
"When that plot failed, the king arranged for Uriah to be killed in battle." "Uriasmi ichaqa mana Bat - sebawan puñuranchu, chaymi Davidqa yuyaykuran Uriasta maqanakuypi wañuchinankupaq."
"Thereafter, Bath - sheba became David’s wife and bore him a child who died. ​ — 2 Samuel 11: 1 - 27." "Urías wañuqtintaq Davidqa Bat - sebawan casarakuran, Bat - sebaq wachakusqan wawataq pisi tiempollamanta wañupuran (2 Samuel 11: 1 - 27)."
"Jehovah handled matters involving David and Bath - sheba." "¿Imatan Jehová Dios ruwaran Davidta Bat - sebatawan?"
"God forgave David, apparently taking into account such factors as his repentance and the Kingdom covenant made with him." "Diosqa Davidpa pesapakusqanta rikuspa, Reinomanta rimanakusqanta mana p’akiyta munaspanmi Davidta pampacharan (2 Samuel 7: 11 - 16; 12: 7 - 14)."
"Bath - sheba evidently had a repentant attitude, for she was privileged to become the mother of King Solomon and an ancestress of Jesus Christ." "Bat - sebapas huchanmanta pesapakunmanmi karan, chaymi payqa Salomonta wachakuran, paypa mirayninmantataq Jesuspas hamuran."
"If we have sinned, it is good to remember that Jehovah takes note of our repentant attitude." "Sichus huchallikuranchis chayqa, yuyarinanchismi Jehová Diosqa pesapakuqkunata pampachaq kasqanta."
"How is the extent of God’s forgiveness illustrated in King Manasseh’s case?" "¿Imaynatan Jehová Dios ancha pampachaykuq kasqanta rikukun Manasesta pampachasqanpi?"
"The extent of Jehovah’s forgiveness is also illustrated in the case of King Manasseh of Judah." "Jehová Diospa ancha pampachaq kasqanta rikullanchistaq Judá rey Manasesta pampachasqanpi."
"He did what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes." "Chay reyqa Jehová Diospa ñawpaqenpi sinchi millaykunata ruwaran."
"Manasseh set up altars to Baal, worshipped “all the army of the heavens, ” and even built altars to false gods in two temple courtyards." "Baalpaq altarkunata ruwachiran, “hanaq pachapi kaq llapan ch’askakunatapas ” yupaycharan, Dios yupaychana wasiq iskaynin pationpipas altarkunata ruwachiran yanqa dioskunata yupaychanankupaq."
"He made his sons pass through the fire, encouraged spiritistic practices, and caused the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem “to do worse than the nations that Jehovah had annihilated from before the sons of Israel. ”" "Churinkunatapas sacrificiopi ruphachiran, watuytapas layqakuytapas astawan mast’arichiran, chaymantapas Judá runakunata Jerusalenpi tiyaq runakunatapas waqllichiran ‘ Señor Diospa wikch’usqan runakunamantapas aswantaraq huchallikunankupaq ’."

"Define kindness, and cite examples of it." "¿Imaynatan sumaq sonqo kayta allin runa kayta rikuchisunman?"
"Kindness is displayed when we show interest in others by means of friendly and helpful words and acts." "¿Pikuna chhayna kanku? Sumaq sonqo kaywan allin runa kaywanqa tupanasqan kashan, chaytaqa rikuchinchis hukkunapi interesakuspa, paykunapaq allin kaqta ruwapuqtinchis rimayninchiswan ruwayninchiswanpas."
"Jehovah is kind, and so is his Son." "Jehová Dioswan Jesuswanqa sumaq sonqon kanku."
"Kindness is expected of servants of God and Christ." "Paykunaq kamachinkunaqa sumaq sonqollataqmi kananchis."
"Even some lacking a personal relationship with God have shown “extraordinary human kindness. ”" "Diosta mana serviqkunapas runamasinkuta ‘ khuyapayankun sumaqtataq rikunkupas ’."
"Surely, then, we can display kindness if we “keep walking by spirit. ”" "Chayrayku ‘ santo espirituq munasqanman hina kawsaqkunaqa ’ astawanraq sumaq sonqo kananchis."
"What are some circumstances that should move us to show kindness?" "¿Imaynakunapin rikuchisunman sumaq sonqo kasqanchista?"
"Kindness can be shown even if we have justifiably become angry because of someone’s hurtful words or inconsiderate actions." "Mayninpiqa razonwanmi phiñakunchis pipas k’arakta rimapayawaqtinchis otaq mana allinta ruwawaqtinchis."
"“Be wrathful, and yet do not sin, ” said Paul." "Chhaynapi tarikuspapas sumaq sonqowanmi tratananchis."

"It is especially fitting to display kindness toward those experiencing trials." "Astawanqa khuyapayakuq sumaq sonqo kananchis sasachakuykunapi tarikuqkunawan."
"Of course, a Christian elder would not be showing kindness if he failed to give Scriptural counsel just to avoid hurting the feelings of someone clearly in danger of abandoning the course of “goodness and righteousness and truth. ” ​ — Ephesians 5: 9." "Pipas ‘ chanin kawsaymanta cheqaq - kaymantawan ’ karunchakushan chayqa, sumaq sonqo ancianokunaqa Bibliawanmi sumaqllata aconsejananku, manataq upallakunankuchu: Sonqontapaschá k’irisaq, nispa yuyaykuspaqa."
"17, 18." "17, 18."
"How is goodness defined, and what role should this quality play in our life?" "¿Imakunawanmi tupallantaq sumaq sonqo kay? ¿Imaynatataq chayman hina kawsasunman?"
"Goodness is virtue, moral excellence, or the quality or state of being good." "Sumaq sonqo kayqa tupallantaqmi allin kaqta ruwaywan allin runa kaywanpas."
"God is good in the absolute sense." "Jehová Diosqa tukuy ruwasqanpin rikuchin sumaq sonqo kasqanta (Salmo 25: 8)."
"Jesus is virtuous and has the quality of moral excellence." "Jesuspas allin kaqllatapunin ruwan."
"Yet, he would not accept “Good ” as a title when he was called“ Good Teacher. ”" "Chaywanpas, Jesusta: “Allin yachachikuq ” niqtinkun payqa mana munaranchu Allin nispa sutichanankuta."
"This was evidently because he recognized God as the pinnacle of goodness." "Jesusqa yacharanmi Dioslla lliwmantapas aswan allin kasqanta."
"Our ability to do good is hindered because of inherited sin." "Huchayoq runamanta hamusqanchisrayku sasan ñoqanchispaq sumaq sonqo kay."
"Nevertheless, we can display this quality if we pray that God ‘ teach us goodness. ’" "Ichaqa, sichus Diosmanta mañakunchis “sumaq sonqo kayta yachachiway ” nispa chayqa, atisunmi sumaq sonqo runa kayta (Salmo 119: 66, NM)."
"Paul told fellow believers in Rome: “I myself also am persuaded about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are also full of goodness, as you have been filled with all knowledge. ”" "Roma llaqtapi tiyaq cristianokunamanmi apóstol Pablo qelqaran: “Wawqe - panaykuna, ñoqaqa manan iskayrayanichu qankunaq sumaq sonqo kasqaykichismanta, hunt’asqata yachasqaykichismantapas ”, nispa."
"A Christian overseer must be “a lover of goodness. ”" "Congregacionpi umalliqkunaqa ‘ allin kaq ruwayta munaqmi ’ kananku."
"If we are led by God’s spirit, we will become known for goodness, and Jehovah will ‘ remember us for the good we do. ’ ​ — Nehemiah 5: 19; 13: 31."

"“Faith Without Hypocrisy ”" "“Cheqaq iñiy ”"
"Define faith, in keeping with Hebrews 11: 1." "Hebreos 11: 1 textoq nisqanman hina, ¿imataq iñiyri?"
"Faith ​ — also part of the spirit’s fruitage — ​ “is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld. ”" "Iñiypas santo espirituq ruruchisqallantaqmi, “iñiyqa suyasqata cheqaqtapuni chaskinapaq yuyaymi, mana rikusqakunamanta pruebakuna kasqanmi ”."
"If we have faith, we are certain that everything Jehovah promises is as good as done." "Iñiyninchis kaqtinqa manan iskayasunchu Jehová Diospa promesankuna hunt’akunanmanta."
"The convincing evidence of unseen realities is so strong that faith is said to be equivalent to that evidence." "Mana rikuna kaqkunamantaqa sut’in pruebakuna kashan, chay pruebakunataq tupan iñiywan."
"For instance, the existence of created things convinces us that there is a Creator." "Ejemplopaq tukuy imaymana kamasqakuna rikuchiwanchis Kamaq kasqanta."
"That is the kind of faith we will display if we keep walking by spirit." "Chhayna iñiyniyoqmi kasunchis Diospa espiritunman hina kawsaqtinchisqa."
"What is “the sin that easily entangles us, ” and how can we avoid it and the works of the flesh?" "¿Imaynatan chay huchamanta runaq munasqan millay ruwaykunamantapas karunchakusunman?"
"Lack of faith is “the sin that easily entangles us. ”" "Ichaqa, mana iñiyniyoq kaytan ninchis “usqhaylla mayt’uykuwaqninchis hucha ”, nispa."
"We need to rely on God’s spirit in order to avoid works of the flesh, materialism, and false teachings that can destroy faith." "Runaq millay munasqan ruwaykunamanta, qolqe sonqo kaymanta, iñiyninchista waqllichiq yachachikuykunamantapas karunchakunapaqqa Diospa espiritunpa munasqanman hina kawsananchis."
"God’s spirit produces in Jehovah’s present - day servants faith like that of pre - Christian witnesses and others of Bible record." "Chay espiritun kunan tiempopi Diospa kamachinkunata yanapan ñawpa tiempopi allin iñiyniyoq runakuna hina kanankupaq."
"And our own “faith without hypocrisy ” may well bolster the faith of others. ​ — 1 Timothy 1: 5; Hebrews 13: 7." "Chaymantapas, “cheqaq iñiyninchisqa ” kallpachanmanmi iñiqmasinchispa iñiyninta."
"Exhibit Mildness and Self - Control" "Llamp’u sonqo kaywan cuerpo kamachiq kaywan"
"21, 22." "21, 22."
"How is mildness defined, and why should we display it?" "¿Imataq llamp’u sonqo kayri? ¿Imaraykutaq llamp’u sonqo kananchis?"
"Mildness is gentleness in temperament and behavior." "Llamp’u sonqo kayqa rimaypi ruwaypipas samp’alla kaymi."
"One of God’s attributes is mildness of temper." "Jehová Diosqa llamp’u sonqon."
"We know this because Jesus, who was a mild - tempered man, perfectly reflected Jehovah’s personality." "Chaytaqa rikukun Jesús llamp’u sonqo kasqanpin, payqa Taytan hinapunin karan."
"What, then, is required of us as God’s servants?" "Chhaynaqa, ¿imaynan kananchis Diospa kamachinkuna?"

"We can exhibit mildness if we consistently walk by spirit and exercise self - control." "Llamp’u sonqo kananchispaqqa santo espirituq munasqanman hinapuni kawsananchis, cuerponchistapas kamachinanchis."
"23, 24." "23, 24."
"What is self - control, and how does it help us?" "¿Imataq cuerpo kamachiyri? ¿Imaynatan yanapawasunman?"
"Self - control enables us to keep our thoughts, speech, and actions in check." "Cuerponta kamachiqqa manan cuerponpa nisqantachu kasun yuyaykuspa rimaspa ruwaspapas."
"Jehovah “kept exercising self - control ” in dealing with the Babylonian desolaters of Jerusalem." "Jehová Diosqa ˈaguantakuranmiˈ babiloniokuna llaqtanta muchuchiqtinpas, paykunan Jerusalenta thuniranku (Isaías 42: 14)."
"His Son ‘ left us a model ’ by exercising self - control during his sufferings." "Jesusmi ejemplonta saqewanchis payta ‘ qatikunanchispaq ’, paypas aguantakuranmi ñak’ariypi tarikuspa."
"And the apostle Peter counseled fellow Christians to ‘ supply to their knowledge self - control. ’ ​ — 1 Peter 2: 21 - 23; 2 Peter 1: 5 - 8." "Apóstol Pedro cristianokunata niran: “Yachaymantaq cuerpowan kasuchikuyta ” yapaychis, nispa."
"Christian elders are expected to be self - controlled." "Congregacionpi umalliqkunaqa cuerponkutan kamachinanku."
"Actually, all who are led by holy spirit can exercise self - control and can thus avoid immorality, vulgar speech, or anything else that could result in Jehovah’s disapproval." "Llapanchismi santo espirituq munasqanman hina kawsaqkunaqa cuerponchista kamachinanchis, chhaynapin karunchakusunchis qhelli huchapi puriymanta, qhelli simikunata rimaymanta, imapas Diosmanta karunchawasunman chaymantapas."
"If we allow God’s spirit to produce self - control within us, this will be apparent to others because of our godly speech and conduct." "Sichus Diospa espiritunwan yanapachikusun cuerponchista kamachinapaq chayqa, sut’itan rikukunqa rimayninchispi ruwayninchispipas."

"As those who are guided by holy spirit, we will also be sources of spiritual encouragement to fellow worshippers of Jehovah." "Santo espirituwan pusachikusun chayqa, iñiqmasinchiskunatapas kallpachasunmi santo espirituwan pusachikunankupaq."
"Is that not what all Christians want to be?" "¿Manachu lliw cristianokuna chayta munanchis?"
"In this world under Satan’s control, it is not easy to walk by spirit." "Satanasmi kay pachata kamachishan, chaymi sasa santo espirituq munasqanman hina kawsayqa."
"Nevertheless, millions are doing so today." "Chaywanpas, waranqa - waranqanpi runakunan chay hinata ruwashanku."

"On one occasion when Jesus was speaking to the crowd on some spiritually enlightening matters, a man interrupted the discussion with a request: “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me. ”" "Huk kutinmi Jesús yachachisharan Diospa Siminmanta askha runakunaman, chayllamanmi huk runa rimasqanta tatichispa kayta mañakuran: “Yachachikuq, wawqeyta niykapuway herenciaykuta rakinakapunaykupaq ”, nispa."
"In response, Jesus provided the man ​ — and all those listening — ​ with some serious counsel." "Mañakusqanta kutichispan Jesusqa chay runaman llapa uyariqkunamanwan allinta yuyaycharan."
"He sounded a strong warning against covetousness and reinforced that warning with a thought - provoking illustration." "Ñawpaqtaqa munapayaymanta karunchakunankupaqmi yachachiran, chaypi yuyaykunankupaqtaq huk rikch’anachiyta willaran."
"We do well to take heed of what Jesus said on that occasion and see how we can benefit by applying it in our own life. ​ — Luke 12: 13 - 21." "Jesuspa yachachisqanman hina kawsananchispaqqa allinta entiendenanchis yuyaychasqanta."
"An Inappropriate Request" "Mana allin kaqta mañakuran"
"Why was the man’s interrupting Jesus inappropriate?" "¿Imarayku mana allinchu karan Jesuspa rimasqanta huk runaq tatichisqan?"
"Prior to the man’s interruption, Jesus was speaking to his disciples and others about being on guard against hypocrisy, about having the courage to confess union with the Son of man, and about receiving help from the holy spirit." "Chay runa manaraq tatichishaqtinmi Jesús rimasharan iskay uya kayman ama urmaykuymanta, runaq Churinpa qatikuqnin kasqankuta ‘ reqsichikuymanta ’, santo espirituq yanapasqanmantawan."
"Surely these are vital subjects that the disciples needed to take to heart." "Chay yachachikuykunaqa ancha allinpunin karan, chaymi Jesuspa qatikuqninkunapas llapa runakunapas tukuy yuyaywan uyarinanku karan."
"In the midst of such a soul - searching discourse, however, the man abruptly cut in and asked Jesus to arbitrate in what appeared to be a family squabble over material possessions." "Chay allin yachachikuykunata yachachishaqtinmi, qonqayllamanta runakuna ukhumanta huk runa Jesusta nimuran herenciamanta familianpi ch’aqway kasqanta allichapunanpaq."
"Yet, there is an important lesson that we can learn from this event." "Chaymantan qatimuq parrafokunapi allinta yachasun."
"What did the man’s request reveal about him?" "¿Imatan chay runa rikuchiran mañakusqanpi?"
"It has been said that “the character of a man is often indicated by the direction which his thoughts take when he is listening to a religious exhortation. ”" "Huk qelqan nin: “Diosmanta rimakushaqtin hukkunapi yuyaykusqanwanmi runaqa reqsichikun imayna kasqanta ”, nispa."
"While Jesus was speaking about serious spiritual matters, the man was probably thinking about what he could do to achieve certain financial advantages." "Jesuspa rimasqanta tatichiq runaqa qhapaq kaykunata imayna tariypipaschá yuyaykusharan allin yachachikuykunata Jesús yachachishaqtin."
"Whether he had a legitimate cause for grievance in connection with the inheritance is not stated." "Bibliaqa manan willanchu herenciamanta quejakusqan allinchus mana allinchus kasqantaqa."
"Perhaps he was trying to capitalize on Jesus ’ authority and reputation as a wise judge in human affairs." "Jesús atiyniyoq kasqanta chanin juez kasqantawan qhawarispapaschá chayta mañakuran (Isaías 11: 3, 4; Mateo 22: 16)."
"In any case, his question suggested that deep down, there was a problem ​ — a serious lack of appreciation for spiritual matters." "Imaynaña kaqtinpas chhayna mañakusqanpin rikuchiran espiritual kaqkunapi mana interesakusqanta."
"Is this not good reason for us to examine ourselves?" "Ñoqanchisri, ¿imaynatan qhawarishanchis espiritual kaqkunata?"
"At Christian meetings, for example, it is easy to allow our mind to wander or to dwell on what we might do later." "Huñunakuypi kashaspa yaqapaschá imaymana ruwananchiskunapi yuyaykushanchis."
"Instead, we should pay attention to what is said and think of ways to make personal application of the information so that we can improve our relationship with our heavenly Father, Jehovah God, and with our fellow Christians. ​ — Psalm 22: 22; Mark 4: 24." "Chay ruwananchismantaqa aswanpas tukuy yuyaywanmi uyarinanchis, chayman hina hanaq pachapi kaq Taytanchis Jehová Dioswan wayqe pananchiskunawanpas allinpi kananchispaq (Salmo 22: 22; Marcos 4: 24)."
"Why did Jesus decline to act as the man requested?" "¿Imarayku Jesús mana kasuranchu chay runaq mañakusqanta?"
"Whatever motivated the man to make the request, Jesus declined to act upon it. Instead, Jesus said to him: “Man, who appointed me judge or apportioner over you persons? ”" "Chay runaq mañakusqan allinña mana allinña karan chaypas Jesusqa manan kasuranchu, aswanmi kayta niran: “Uyariy, runa, ¿pitaq qankuna ukhupi juezpaqpas rakiqpaqpas churawarqan? ”"
"In saying that, Jesus was referring to something that the people were well - aware of, for according to the Mosaic Law, judges in the cities were appointed to rule on just such matters." "nispa. Moisespa Kamachikuy Simiq nisqanman hinaqa juezkunan chay sasachaytaqa allichanan karan, chaytan Jesusqa nisharan (Deuteronomio 16: 18 - 20; 21: 15 - 17; Rut 4: 1, 2)."
"Jesus, on the other hand, was concerned with more important things ​ — to bear witness to Kingdom truth and to teach people God’s will." "Jesusqa manan chaykunata ruwaqchu hamuran, aswanmi hamuran Reinomanta cheqaqta yachachiq Diospa munayninmantawan yachachinanpaq."
"Following Jesus ’ example, rather than being sidetracked by mundane issues, we use our time and energy to preach the good news and to “make disciples of people of all the nations. ” ​ — Matthew 24: 14; 28: 19." "Ñoqanchispas Jesús hinan kananchis, tukuy kallpawanmi allin willakuykunata willamunanchis ‘ llapa runakunamanpas yachachimunanchis ’, amataq huk ruwaykunallapiqa tiemponchista usuchisunchu."
"Beware of Covetousness" "Munapayaymanta cuidakusun"
"What penetrating observation did Jesus make?" "¿Ima niranmi Jesús munapayaymanta?"
"Being able to discern the deepest intentions of the heart, Jesus was aware that something more serious was involved in the man’s request for Jesus to intervene in a personal matter." "Chay runaqa manan herencia rakipunallantachu munaran aswanmi sonqonpi mana allin kaqta munasharan, chaytan Jesusqa yacharan. Chaymi Jesusqa mana kasuranchu chay runaq mañakusqanta, aswanmi sonqonpi kasqanta sut’incharan."
"Thus, instead of simply turning down the request, Jesus got to the heart of the matter and said: “Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of covetousness, because even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses. ” ​ — Luke 12: 15." "Paymi niran: ‘ Qhawarikuychis, tukuy imaymana munapayaymanta cuidakuychis. Runaq kawsayninqa manan askha kaqniyoq kaspallachu allin kanqa ’, nispa."
"What is covetousness, and what can it lead to?" "¿Iman munapayay, imamanmi tanqawasunman?"
"Covetousness is more than simply the desire to have money or certain things, which could have their proper use and purpose." "Munapayayqa manan necesitasqanchiskunata munayllachu."
"It is the “inordinate desire for wealth or possessions or for another’s possessions, ” according to one dictionary." "Aswanmi munapayayqa qolqeta, qhapaq kayta, hukpa kaqnintapas sinchita munay, chaytan askha diccionariokuna nin."
"It can involve the insatiable, greedy urge to have things ​ — perhaps those belonging to someone else — ​ simply for the sake of having them, without regard for one’s own needs or the effect on others." "Mayninqa manaña necesitankuchu chaypas kaqniyoq kani ninallankupaqmi imatapas rantinku otaq runakunaq qhawarinallanpaq."
"A covetous person allows the object of his desire to dominate his thinking and actions to such an extent that it in essence becomes his god." "Munapayaq runaqa munasqallanpiñan yuyaykun chayman hinallañan imatapas ruwan, chaytaqmi diosninman tukupun."
"Recall that the apostle Paul equates a greedy person with an idolater, who has no share in God’s Kingdom. ​ — Ephesians 5: 5; Colossians 3: 5." "Apóstol Pablopas ídolo yupaychaywanmi munapayayta tupachiran, nirantaq munapayaqkunaqa manan Diospa Reinonman haykunqakuchu nispa."
"In what ways can covetousness be manifested?" "¿Imakunatan munapayasunman?"
"Give some examples." "Ejemplokunata willay."
"Interestingly, Jesus warned against “every sort of covetousness. ”" "Jesusqa anyaranñan “tukuy imaymana munapayaymanta ”."
"Covetousness comes in many forms." "Arí, imaymanatan munapayasunman."
"The last of the Ten Commandments enumerated some of them, stating: “You must not desire your fellowman’s house." "Diospa Chunka Kamachikuykuna qosqanpa tukuyninpin willan wakinmanta: “Aman munapayankichu runamasiykiq wasinta, warminta, qhari kamachinta, warmi kamachinta, toronta, asnonta, runamasiykiq imantawanpas ”, nispa (Éxodo 20: 17)."
"You must not desire your fellowman’s wife, nor his slave man nor his slave girl nor his bull nor his ass nor anything that belongs to your fellowman. ”" "Bibliaq willasqan hina, askha runakunan hatun huchaman urmaykuranku munapayaq kasqankumanta."
"The Bible is replete with examples of individuals who have fallen into grievous sin on account of covetousness of one kind or another." "Ñawpaqtaqa Satanasmi Jehová Diospa hatunchayninta, yupaychayninta, atiynintawan munapayaran."
"Satan was the first to covet something that belonged to someone else ​ — the glory, honor, and authority that are Jehovah’s alone." "Evapas munayniyoq kayta munapayaspa Saqrawan q’otuchikuran, chhaynapin huchata wañuytawan paqarichiran (Génesis 3: 4 - 7)."
"The demons were angels who became discontented with “their original position but forsook their own proper dwelling place ” for something to which they were not entitled." "Mana contentakuq supaykunapas paykunapaq mana kaqta munapayaspa ‘ hanaq pacha tiyanankuta saqepuranku ’."
"Think, too, of Balaam, Achan, Gehazi, and Judas." "Chhaynan kallarankutaq Balaam, Ahan, Giezi, Judas Iscariotepas."
"Instead of being content with their lot in life, they allowed an inordinate desire for material possessions to cause them to misuse their trust, plunging them into ruin and destruction." "Kaqninkunawan kusisqa kanankumantaqa qhapaq kaykunata munapayaspan imachus hunt’anankuta saqepuranku, chaytaqmi paykunata wañuyman aparan."
"How should we ‘ keep our eyes open, ’ as Jesus admonished?" "¿Imarayku Jesuspa yuyaychasqan hina allinta ‘ qhawarikunanchis ’?"
"How fitting that Jesus prefaced the warning against covetousness with the words “keep your eyes open ”!" "Munapayaymanta anyananpaqmi Jesús khaynata qallariran: ‘ Qhawarikuychis ’, nispa."
Why? "¿Imarayku chayta niran?"
"Because it is so easy for people to see that someone else is being greedy or covetous, but it is rare that they will acknowledge that they themselves are guilty of it." "Apóstol Pablo niran, “Qolqe sonqo - kaymi tukuy mana allinkunaq saphinqa ”, nispa. Santiagon nillantaq, mana allin kaqta munaymi“ saphichakuspa huchata paqarichin ”, nispa."
"Yet, the apostle Paul points out that “the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things. ”" "Chaymi Jesuspa yuyaychasqanta kasukuspa allinta ‘ qhawarikunanchis ’."
"The disciple James explains that wrong desire, “when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin. ”" "Manan hukkunatachu qhawana munapayaqchus icha manachus kasqankuta, aswanmi sapanka qhawarikunanchis imayna kasqanchista."
"In line with Jesus ’ admonition, we should ‘ keep our eyes open, ’ not to observe others to see if they fit the description, but to examine ourselves to see what we have set our hearts on, so as to “guard against every sort of covetousness. ”" "Chhaynapin ‘ tukuy imaymana munapayaymanta cuidakusun ’."
"A Life of Abundance" "Askha kaqniyoq kaspa"
"11, 12. (a) What warning did Jesus give against covetousness?" "11, 12. a) ¿Imaraykun Jesús niran munapayaymanta cuidakuychis nispa?"
"(b) Why do we need to heed Jesus ’ warning?" "b) ¿Imarayku yuyaymanananchis chay nisqanpi?"
"There is yet another reason why we must guard against covetousness." "Kallantaqmi huk razón munapayaymanta cuidakunanchispaq."
"Note what Jesus next said: “Even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses. ”" "Chaypaq qhawarisun Jesuspa kay nisqanta: “Runaq kawsayninqa manan askha kaqniyoq kaspallachu allin kanqa ”."
"This certainly is food for thought in our materialistic age, when people equate affluence and prosperity with happiness and success." "Kay tiempopi runakunaqa qhapaq kayninpi maskhanku kusikuyta allin kawsaytapas, chaymi Jesuspa chay nisqanpi allinta yuyaymanananchis."
"By those words, Jesus was pointing out that a truly meaningful and satisfying life does not result from or depend on material possessions, no matter how abundant." "Chhayna nisqanpi Jesús rikuchisharan, imayna qhapaqña runakuna kankuman chaypas manan cheqaq kusikuyta allin kawsaytapas tarinkumanchu."
"Some, however, may disagree." "Wakin runakunan ichaqa mana chhaynatachu yuyaykunku."
"They may reason that material possessions make life more comfortable and enjoyable, thus more worthwhile." "Aswanmi ninku, qhapaq kaspa imaymanayoq kanchis chaykunawantaqmi aswan allinta kawsanchis, nispa."
"Hence, they devote themselves to pursuits that would give them the ability to acquire all the goods and gadgets that they desire." "Chhaynata yuyaykuspan imaymanata ruwanku tukuy munasqankuta tarinankupaq."
"This, they think, will result in a good life." "Chhaynata yuyaykuqkunaqa manan yuyarinkuchu Jesuspa nisqanta."
"But in so thinking, they miss the point Jesus was making." "¿Imaynatan qhawarina kawsayta imaymanayoq kaytapas?"
"What is a balanced view of life and possessions?" "Jesusqa manan askha kaqniyoq kay allin otaq mana allin kasqanmantachu rimaran."
"Instead of focusing on whether it is right or wrong to have an abundance, Jesus was making the point that a man’s life does not result from “the things he possesses, ” that is, the things he already has." "Aswanmi niran, runakunaq kawsayninqa “manan askha kaqniyoq ” kasqanmantachu kanqa nispa."
"In this regard, we all know that to live, or to sustain the life we have, does not really require very much." "Kawsananchispaqqa manan askhatachu necesitanchis."
"It takes only a little food, something to wear, and a place to lie down." "As pisi mikhunata, p’achata, maypi samarikunallatawanmi necesitanchis."
"The rich have an abundance of these things, and the poor may have to struggle to obtain what they need." "Qhapaqkunaqa imaymanayoqmi kanku, wakchakunan ichaqa anchata llank’ananku imachus necesitasqankuta tarinankupaq."
"What difference there is, however, is equalized when life comes to its end ​ — everything comes to naught." "Ichaqa wakchaña qhapaqña kanku chaypas wañupuqtinkuqa lliwmi tukukapun (Eclesiastés 9: 5, 6)."
"Thus, for life to have meaning and worth, it cannot and should not simply consist of things that one can acquire or possess." "Chaymi mana qhapaq kaykunapichu allin kawsayta maskhana."
"This thought becomes evident when we examine what life Jesus was speaking about." "Chaytan yachanchis Jesús imayna kawsaymanta rimasqanpi."
"What can we learn from the word for “life ” found in the Bible account?" "¿Imatan yachanchis ‘ kawsaymanta ’ Jesuspa willasqanpi?"
"When Jesus said that “life does not result from the things he possesses, ” the word used here for“ life ” in Luke’s Gospel (Greek, zo·eʹ) refers, not to the manner or style of living, but to life itself, life in the absolute sense." "Lucas qelqapi willasqan hina, ¿imatan Jesús nisharan, “runaq kawsayninqa manan askha kaqniyoq kaspallachu allin kanqa ” nispa nisqanwan? Chay textopi ‘ kawsay ’ simiqa zo·é nisqa griego rimaymantan t’ikrakun, chay simin tupan kawsaywan manan imayna kawsasqanchiswanchu."
"* Jesus was saying that whether we are rich or poor, whether we live in luxury or we barely eke out an existence, we do not have complete control over how long we may live or whether we will even be alive tomorrow." "* Jesusqa kaytan nisharan, qhapaqña wakchaña kanchis chaypas manan yachanchischu hayk’a tiempo kawsananchista paqarin kawsasunraqchus manachus chaytapas."
"Jesus stated in his Sermon on the Mount: “Who of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span? ”" "Orqo Patapi yachachishaspapas kaytan niran: “¿Mayqenniykichistaq atinman llakikushaspa, sayayninman [otaq kawsayninman] huk chhikallantawanpas yapaykukuyta? ”"
"The Bible clearly shows that Jehovah alone is “the source of life, ” and only he can grant faithful ones“ the real life, ” or “everlasting life, ” life without end, either in heaven or on earth. ​ — Psalm 36: 9; 1 Timothy 6: 12, 19." "nispa. Bibliaq willasqan hina, Jehová Diosmantan “kawsayqa paqarimun ”, payllan hunt’aq kamachinkunaman hanaq pachapipas kay Hallp’apipas ‘ cheqaq kawsayta ’ otaq ‘ wiñay kawsayta ’ qonqa (Salmo 36: 9; 1 Timoteo 6: 12, 19)."
"Why do many put their trust in material possessions?" "¿Imarayku askha runakuna qhapaq kaykunata maskhanku?"
"Jesus ’ words point out how easy it is for people to have a warped or distorted view of life." "Runakunaqa manan allintachu kawsayta rikusunman, chaytan Jesuspa nisqanpi reparanchis."
"Whether rich or poor, all humans are imperfect and have but one eventuality." "Llapa runakunan — wakchapas qhapaqpas — huchayoq kanchis, llapallanchistaqmi kaqpi tukukapunchis."
"Moses of old observed: “In themselves the days of our years are seventy years; and if because of special mightiness they are eighty years, yet their insistence is on trouble and hurtful things; for it must quickly pass by, and away we fly. ”" "Profeta Moisesmi khaynata rimaran: “Qanchis chunka watallan kawsayku, kallpasapakunataq pusaq chunkakama chayayku, chaypas, chay watakunapiqa uma nanayllan, sasa kawsayllan. Usqhayllan watakunaqa ripushan, ñoqaykupas chinkaripushaykun ”, nispa (Salmo 90: 10; Job 14: 1, 2; 1 Pedro 1: 24)."
"For this reason, people who have not cultivated a good relationship with God often adopt the “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we are to die ” mentality, referred to by the apostle Paul." "Chayrayku, apóstol Pablo nisqan hina, Diosta mana reqsiq runakunaqa khaynata yuyaykunku: “Mikhusunchis, ukyasunchis, paqarinmi wañupusunchis ”, nispa."
"Others, sensing that life is fleeting and uncertain, try to find security and permanence in material possessions." "Wakin runakunataq imapaq kawsasqankuta mana yachaspa pisi tiempolla kawsasqankutawan reparaspa qhapaq kaykunata maskhanku thakpi, allinpi kawsanankupaq."
"Perhaps they feel that having many physical, tangible material things will somehow make life more secure." "Chay qhapaq kaykunawan aswan allin kawsanankutapaschá yuyaykunku."
"Thus, they labor incessantly to amass wealth and possessions, mistakenly equating such things with security and happiness. ​ — Psalm 49: 6, 11, 12." "Chayraykun mana samaspa llank’anku qhapaq kaykunata huñunankupaq chaywan aswan kusisqa kawsanankuta yuyaykuspa (Salmo 49: 6, 11, 12)."
"A Secure Future" "Aswan allinta kawsanapaq"
"On what is true worth in life not based?" "¿Imakunan mana sinchi chaniyoqchu?"
"It may be true that a higher living standard ​ — having an abundance of food, clothing, shelter, and other amenities — ​ could contribute to a more comfortable life or may even allow for better medical care and thus add a few years to a person’s life span." "Yaqapaschá allinta kawsasunman askha mikhunayoq, p’achayoq, imaymanayoq kaspapas. Aswan allin medicokunawanpaschá hanpichikusunman aswan unayta kawsanapaq."
"However, is such a life really more meaningful and more secure?" "Ichaqa ¿aswan chaniyoqchu kanman chay kawsay?"
"True worth in life is not measured in the number of years one might live or the amount of material things one might possess or enjoy." "Manan aswan unayta kawsaspachu nitaq imaymanayoq kaspachu aswan allinta kawsasunchis."
"The apostle Paul pointed to the danger of putting too much stock in such things." "Apóstol Pablon anyaran chaykunaman ama k’askakunapaq."
"To Timothy he wrote: “Give orders to those who are rich in the present system of things not to be high - minded, and to rest their hope, not on uncertain riches, but on God, who furnishes us all things richly for our enjoyment. ” ​ — 1 Timothy 6: 17." "Timoteoman kayta qelqaran: “Kay pachapi qhapaqkunata kamachiy ama hatunchakuq kanankupaq, amataq qhapaq kaykunamanpas k’askakunankupaq, aswanpas kawsaq Diosman hap’ipakunankupaq. Qhapaq kaykunaqa tukurqokuqllan."
"17, 18. (a) What outstanding examples with regard to material possessions are worthy of our imitation?" "Payllan kusikunanchispaq tukuy imaymanatapas askhatapuni qowanchis ”, nispa. 17, 18. a) ¿Pikunan allin ejemplo karanku qhapaq kayman mana k’askakuypi?"
"(b) What parable of Jesus will be considered in the following article?" "b) ¿Ima rikch’anachiymantan qatimuq estudiopi yachasun?"
"To rest one’s hope on riches is unwise because they are “uncertain. ”" "Qhapaq kaykunaqa ‘ tukurqokuqllan ’, chaymi chaykunaman k’askakuyqa mana allinchu."
"The patriarch Job was very well - off, but when disaster struck suddenly, his riches could not help him; they vanished overnight." "Ñawpa tayta Jobpas sinchi qhapaqmi karan. Ichaqa manan sasachakuyninkunamanta qespichiranchu, aswanmi chay qhapaq kaykunaqa ch’usaqman tukupuran."
"It was his solid relationship with God that preserved him through all the trials and tribulations." "Aswanpas Diosman k’askakusqanmi kallpacharan wateqaypi ñak’ariypi tarikushaqtin (Job 1: 1, 3, 20 - 22)."
"Abraham did not allow his abundant material possessions to prevent him from accepting a challenging assignment from Jehovah, and he was blessed with becoming the “father of a crowd of nations. ”" "Abrahanpas qhapaqña karan chaypas kasukuranmi Diospa kamachisqanta. Chaymi ‘ askha runaq taytan ’ kananpaq saminchasqa karan (Génesis 12: 1, 4; 17: 4 - 6)."
"These and other examples are worthy of our imitation." "Chay iskay runakuna hinan askha runakuna qatikunapaq hina kanku."
"Young or old, we need to examine ourselves to see what is truly important in our life and on what we rest our hope. ​ — Ephesians 5: 10; Philippians 1: 10." "¿Imatan ñawpaqta maskhashanchis, imamanmi k’askakushanchis?, chaytan wayna sipaskunapas kuraqkunapas qhawarikunanchis."
"The few words that Jesus spoke on covetousness and the proper view of life are meaningful and instructive indeed." "Munapayaymanta, kawsayta imayna qhawarinamantawan Jesuspa rimasqanqa ancha allinpunin."
"However, Jesus had something further in mind, and he went on to relate a thought - provoking parable, or illustration, about an unreasonable rich man." "Ichaqa huk rikch’anachiytawanmi willaran mana yuyayniyoq qhapaq runamanta."
"How is that illustration pertinent to our life today, and what can we learn from it?" "¿Imapin chay rikch’anachiy yanapawasunman, imatawanmi chaymanta yachasunman?"
"The next article will provide the answers." "Qatimuq estudiopin chay tapuykuna kutichikunqa."
[Footnote] "[Uranpi willakuy]"
"Another Greek word translated “life ” is biʹos, from which come such English words as“ biography ” and “biology. ”" "‘ Kawsay ’ simiqa bí·os nisqa griego rimaymantan t’ikrakullantaq, chaymantan paqarimun españolpi biografía, biología nisqa simikunapas."
"According to Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words, biʹos refers to “the period or duration of life, ”“ the manner of life, ” and “the means of life. ”" "E. Vine, nisqa qelqan bí·os simita tupachin “hayk’a tiempo kawsasqanchiswan ”,“ imayna kawsasqanchiswan ” otaq “imakunawan kawsasqanchispiwan ”."

"Are You “Rich Toward God ”?" "¿Qhapaqchu kanchis Diospaq?"
"“So it goes with the man that lays up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God. ” ​ — LUKE 12: 21." "“Chhaynan payllapaq qhapaq kayta waqaychaqqa, Diospa qhawarinanpaqmi ichaqa wakcha. ”"
"1, 2. (a) For what have people been willing to make great sacrifices?" "1, 2. a) ¿Imata munaspan askha runakuna hatun sacrificiokunata ruwanku?"
"(b) What challenge and danger must Christians face?" "b) ¿Ima sasachakuykunapin cristianokuna tarikunku, imamanmi chay tanqanman?"
"TREASURE HUNTING is not just a game that children like to play; it is also a real - life drama played out again and again in many ages and societies." "PAKASQA qorita maskhayqa manan wawakunaq pukllasqan hinallachu. Tukuy tiempopin llapa llaqtakunapin runakunaqa qori maskhaypi puriqku."
"For example, the gold rush of the 19th century in Australia, South Africa, Canada, and the United States attracted people from far away who were willing to leave home and loved ones to seek fortunes in strange, sometimes hostile, lands." "Siglo XIX nisqapin qori maskhay q’oñiriran, chaymi sinchi askha runakuna Australia, Canadá, Estados Unidos, Sudáfrica nisqa suyukunata riranku qorita maskhanankupaq."
"Yes, many people are willing to take extreme risks and make enormous sacrifices in order to attain the riches that their hearts desire." "Qhapaq kayta munaspan wasinkuta, munakusqanku runakunatapas saqespa karuta riranku mana reqsisqa cheqaskunata, mayninpiqa mana tiyanapaq hina cheqaskunata."
"Though most people today are not taking part in a literal treasure hunt, they do have to work hard to make a living." "Arí, qhapaq kaykunata munapayasqankuraykun askha runakuna hatun sacrificiokunata ruwanku."
"To do that in the present system of things can be challenging, demanding, and burdensome." "Kay tiempopi manaña qori maskhaypichu runakuna purinku chaypas, anchatan kallpachakunku familiankuta mantienenankupaq."
"It is easy to become so concerned with food, clothing, and shelter that the more important things are neglected or even forgotten." "Kay tiempopi qolqe tariyqa sinchi sasan. Chaymi, mikhunamanta, p’achamanta, wasimantawan sinchita llakikuspa qonqapunku aswan chaniyoq kaqkunata."
"Jesus gave an illustration, or parable, that accurately delineated this human tendency." "Chaykunapi runakunaq afanakusqantan Jesús huk rikch’anachiypi sut’incharan."
"It is found at Luke 12: 16 - 21." "Chaymi tarikun Lucas 12: 16 - 21 textopi."
"Briefly relate Jesus ’ illustration recorded at Luke 12: 16 - 21." "Pisillapi willay Lucas 12: 16 - 21 textopi Jesuspa rikch’anachiy ruwasqanmanta."
"Jesus ’ illustration was given on the same occasion that he spoke about the need to guard against covetousness, which we examined in some detail in the preceding article." "Manaraq chay rikch’anachiyta willashaspan Jesusqa munapayaymanta cuidakunapaq rimasharan, chaytaqa ñawpaq estudiopin allinta t’aqwiranchisña."
"After warning about covetousness, Jesus spoke about a rich man who is not content with storehouses filled with good things he already has but who tears them down and builds bigger ones in order to lay up more good things." "Chay rikch’anachiypin huk qhapaq runa taqena wasinkuna hunt’a kasqanwan mana contentakuspa taqena wasinkunata thunispa aswan hatuchachaqkunata sayarichiran."
"Just as he thinks he is ready to relax and enjoy a good life, God tells him that his life is coming to an end and all the good things the man has stored up will go to someone else." "Qhapaq kayninkunawan samakuspa allin kawsananta yuyaykushaqtinmi ichaqa Dios willaran wañupunanta qhapaq kayninkunapas hukpa kapunanta."
"Then Jesus added the concluding statement: “So it goes with the man that lays up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God. ”" "Rikch’anachiymanta willayta tukushaspataq Jesús kayta niran: “Chhaynan payllapaq qhapaq kayta waqaychaqqa, Diospa qhawarinanpaqmi ichaqa wakcha [kashan] ”, nispa."
"What lesson can we learn from this parable?" "¿Imatan yachanchis chay rikch’anachiymanta?"
"How can we apply the lesson to our own life?" "¿Imaynatan kawsasunman chay rikch’anachiypi yachasqanchisman hina?"
"A Man With a Problem" "Huk runa sasachakuypi tarikun"
"What kind of man could we say was portrayed in Jesus ’ parable?" "¿Ima nisunmanmi rikch’anachiypi Jesuspa rimasqan runamanta?"
"The illustration that Jesus gave is a familiar one." "Jesusmi chay rikch’anachiyta willaspa khaynata qallariran: “Huk qhapaq runan chakranmanta askhallataña cosecharqan ”, nispa."
"We note that Jesus introduced the story simply by saying: “The land of a certain rich man produced well. ”" "Jesusqa manan chay runamanta niranchu, suwakuspan qhapaq kayta tariran nispa, nitaq millay runata hinachu rikuchiran."
"Jesus did not say that the man acquired his riches by some devious or unlawful means." "Aswanmi rimasqanpi reparanchis chay runaqa anchata llank’aspa qhapaqman tukupusqanta."
"At least it can be understood that he was a man who planned and saved for the future, perhaps with the welfare of his family in mind." "Chay rikch’anachiypi runaqa yaqapaschá familianpa allin kananta munaspa hamuq tiempopaq qhapaq kayta waqaycharan."
"Thus, from a secular point of view, he can be taken to represent a hardworking man who took his obligations seriously." "Arí, qhawarinapaqqa imaymana ruwananta hunt’ananpaq allin llank’aq runan karan."
"What problem confronts the man in Jesus ’ parable?" "¿Ima sasachakuypin tarikuran rikch’anachiypi runa?"
"In any case, Jesus did call the individual in the parable a rich man, meaning someone who already had in his possession an abundance of material goods." "Imaynaña kaqtinpas chay runaqa qhapaq runan karan."
"However, as Jesus described it, the rich man had a problem." "Ichaqa Jesuspa willasqan hina sasachakuypin tarikuran."
"His land produced much more than he expected, above and beyond what he needed or could care for." "Tarpusqanmi sinchi askhata rurusqa: sinchi askhallañan karan, chaymi taqena wasikunapas manaña ayparanchu."
"What should he have done?" "¿Imatan ruwanan karan?"
"What choices do many of God’s servants face today?" "¿Imakunatan munachinku kay tiempopi Jehová Diospa testigonkunaman?"
"Many of Jehovah’s servants today face situations very much like that of the rich man." "Chay qhapaq runa hinan kay tiempopi Diospa kamachinkunapas tarikunku."
"True Christians strive to be honest, diligent, and conscientious workers." "Cheqaq cristianokunaqa hukpaqña kikinkupaqña llank’anku chaypas, kallpachakunkun honrado kanankupaq, hunt’aq kanankupaq, allin llank’aq kanankupaqpas."
"Whether they are employed or they have their own business, they often do well, even excel in what they do." "Chhayna kasqankuraykun allin llank’anayoq kanku allinkamataq lloqsin ima ruwasqankupas."
"When promotions or new opportunities come along, they are confronted with a decision." "Ichaqa allintan qhawarikunanku aswan allin llank’anata munachiqtinku otaq aswan allin llank’ana kaqtinpas."
"Should they move up or expand?" "¿Llank’anankuchu chaykunapi aswan qolqeyoq kanankupaq?"
"Likewise, many Witness youths do well in school." "Chhaynallataqmi yachay wasipi kaqkunapaqpas."
"As a result, they may be offered awards or scholarships for advanced education at prestigious institutions." "Allin yachaq kasqankuraykun wayna sipas Testigokunaman munachinku becakunata otaq huk yanapaykunatapas allin universidadkunapi estudianankupaq."
"Should they simply go along and accept what is offered?" "¿Yachaqmasinkuna chay yanapaykunata chaskikusqankuraykuchu paykunapas chaskikunkuman?"
"How did the man in Jesus ’ parable deal with his problem?" "¿Imatan yuyaykuran rikch’anachiypi runa sasachayninta allichananpaq?"
"Coming back to Jesus ’ illustration, what did the rich man do when his land produced so well that he had nowhere to store his harvest?" "Jesuspa rikch’anachiy ruwasqanpi, ¿imatan qhapaq runa ruwaran taqena wasinkunaman cosechasqan mikhuykuna manaña haykuqtin?"
"He decided to tear down the storehouses that he had and build bigger ones to store all the excess grain and good things." "Taqena wasikunata thunispa aswan hatuchaq wasikunata sayarichinanpaq yuyaykuran chayman llapa mikhuyninkunata kaqninkunatapas waqaychananpaq."
"That plan apparently gave him such a sense of security and satisfaction that he thought to himself: “I will say to my soul: ‘ Soul, you have many good things laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, enjoy yourself. ’ ” ​ — Luke 12: 19." "Chhayna yuyaykusqanwan allin kananta yuyaykuspan niran: “Sonqoyta nisaq: Sonqolláy, ñan askhaña kaqniykikuna askha watapaq taqesqa kapusunki.

"Why “Unreasonable ”?" "¿Imarayku chay runata nikun “mana yuyayniyoq ” nispa?"
"What vital element did the man in Jesus ’ parable overlook?" "¿Ima chanin ruwaytan Jesuspa rikch’anachisqanpi runa qonqapusqa?"
"As Jesus presented it, however, the rich man’s plan provided only a false sense of security." "Jesuspa nisqan hina, chay runa qhapaq kaywan allinpi kawsananta yuyaykusqanqa yanqapaqmi karan."
"Practical as it might have seemed, it left out one vital element ​ — God’s will." "Allin hinaña yuyaykusqan karan chaypas, qonqapusqan imachus Diospa munaynin kasqanta."
"The man was only thinking about himself, how he would be able to take his ease and eat, drink, and enjoy himself." "Chay runaqa thak kaypi, mikhuypi, ukyaypi, kusisqa kawsanallanpin yuyaykuran."
"He thought that because of having “many good things, ” he would also have“ many years. ”" "‘ Askha kaqniyoq ’ kasqanraykun yuyaykuran chaykunawan ‘ askha watakuna ’ kusisqa kawsananta."
"But too bad for him, things did not work out that way." "Ichaqa manan chhaynachu karan."
"Just as Jesus said earlier, “even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses. ”" "Jesuspa nisqan hina, “runaq kawsayninqa manan askha kaqniyoq kaspallachu allin kanqa ”."
"That very night, everything the man had worked for came to an abrupt end, for God said to him: “Unreasonable one, this night they are demanding your soul from you." "Chaymi rikch’anachiypi runapas chay tutapacha saqepunan karan llank’aspa tukuy imaymana huñusqanta, Diosmi payta niran: “Mana yuyayniyoq runa, kunan tutan wañupunki."
"Who, then, is to have the things you stored up? ” ​ — Luke 12: 20." "Waqaychasqaykikunari, ¿pipaqtaq kanqa? ” nispa."
"Why was the man in the parable called unreasonable?" "¿Imaraykun rikch’anachiypi runata nikun mana yuyayniyoq nispa?"
"Here, we come to the central point of Jesus ’ illustration." "Kunanqa Jesuspa rikch’anachiy ruwasqanta sut’inchasun."
"God called the man unreasonable." "Diosmi chay runata niran mana yuyayniyoq nispa."
"The Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament explains that forms of the Greek word used “always signify a lack of understanding. ”" "Diccionario exegético del Nuevo Testamento nisqa qelqan mana yuyayniyoq nisqa simita tupachin “allin yuyaymanta t’aqakuywan ”."
"It observes that in this parable, God is represented as using the word to expose “the meaninglessness of the future plans of the rich. ”" "Chay diccionarion nillantaq, rikch’anachiypi runatan Dios nisqa mana yuyayniyoq nispa “hamuq tiempopaq qhapaq kaykunata yanqapaq huñusqanrayku ”, hinaspapas mana yuyayniyoq nisqa simiqa manan mana yachayniyoq kaywanchu tupan, aswanmi“ Diosmanta yuyaypi karunchakuywan ”, nispa."
"The word refers, not to one who lacks intelligence, but to “one who refuses to acknowledge dependence on God. ”" "Rikch’anachiypi runamanta nisqanta hinan Laodicea (Asia Menor) congregacionpi kaq cristianokunatapas Jesús niran: “Qanqa ninkin: Ñoqaqa qhapaqmi kani, tukuy imapas allinkaman kawan, manan imapas pisiwanchu, nispa."
"Jesus ’ description of the rich man brings to mind what he later said to the Christians in the first - century congregation in Laodicea, Asia Minor: “You say: ‘ I am rich and have acquired riches and do not need anything at all, ’ but you do not know you are miserable and pitiable and poor and blind and naked. ” ​ — Revelation 3: 17." "Ichaqa manan reparakunkichu, huk khuyapayana, mana imayoq, wakcha, ñawsa, q’alalla kashasqaykita ”, nispa."
"Why is the possession of “many good things ” no guarantee of having“ many years ”?" "¿Imaraykun mana ‘ askha kaqniyoq ’ kaychu aswan ‘ askha watata ’ kawsachiwasunman?"
"We do well to take the lesson to heart." "¿Urmasunmanchu chaypi ñoqanchispas?"
"Could we be like the man in the parable ​ — work very hard to make sure that we would have “many good things ” yet fail to do what is necessary to gain the prospect of having“ many years ”?" "Rikch’anachiypi runa hinapaschá ‘ askha kaqniyoq ’ kanapaq sinchita llank’asunman, ‘ askha watakuna ’ kawsanapaqtaq ichaqa pisita ruwasunman."
"The Bible says: “Valuable things will be of no benefit on the day of fury, ” and“ the one trusting in his riches ​ — he himself will fall. ”" "Biblia nin: “Qhapaq kaykunaqa juicio p’unchaypi manan imapaqpas valenqachu ”,“ qhapaq kayninman k’askakuqqa urmaykunqan ”, nispa (Proverbios 11: 4, 28)."
"Therefore, Jesus added this final admonition to the parable: “So it goes with the man that lays up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God. ” ​ — Luke 12: 21." "Chaymi Jesusqa rikch’anachiyta willayta tukuspa kayta anyaran: “Chhaynan payllapaq qhapaq kayta waqaychaqqa, Diospa qhawarinanpaqmi ichaqa wakcha ”, nispa."
"Why is it futile to build one’s hope and security on material possessions?" "¿Imaraykun mana allinchu kanman qhapaq kaykunaman k’askakuy?"
"When Jesus said “so it goes, ” he was pointing out that what happened to the rich man in the illustration will also happen to those who build their life ​ — their hope and their security — ​ solely on material possessions." "“Chhaynan ”, nispa nisqanwanmi Jesús rikuchisharan qhapaq kayllawan allin kanankuta yuyaykuqkunatapas rikch’anachiypi qhapaq runata hina sucedenanta."
"The fault is not so much in ‘ laying up treasure for oneself ’ as it is in failing to be “rich toward God. ”" "‘ Qhapaq kayta waqaychayqa ’ manan huchachu, ‘ Diospa qhawarinanpaq [...] wakcha ’ kaymi ichaqa mana allinchu."
"The disciple James sounded a similar warning when he wrote: “Come, now, you who say: ‘ Today or tomorrow we will journey to this city and will spend a year there, and we will engage in business and make profits, ’ whereas you do not know what your life will be tomorrow. ”" "Santiagopas chayman rikch’akuqtan nillarantaq: “Wakinniykichismi ninkichis: Kunanpas paqarinpas chay llaqtata risunchis, chaypitaq huk watata kamusun, qhatumusunchis, hinaspa qolqeta tarimusunchis, nispa, chayrayku uyariwaychis, qankunaqa manan yachankichischu imachus paqarin sucedenasuykichista ”."
"What should they do?" "¿Ima nispan Santiago yuyaycharan?"
"“Instead, you ought to say: ‘ If Jehovah wills, we shall live and also do this or that. ’ ”" "“Aswanpas kay hinatachá niwaqchis: Señor munaqtinqa kawsasunchis, hinaspa kaytapas chaytapas ruwasunchis ”, nispa."
"No matter how rich a person may be or how many possessions he may have, all will prove to be futile unless he is rich toward God." "Qhapaq kaykunaqa yanqapaqmi kanqa Diospaq mana qhapaq kaspaqa."
"What, then, does it mean to be rich toward God?" "¿Imaynatan Diospaq qhapaq kasunman?"
"To Be Rich Toward God" "Diospaq qhapaq kasun"
"Doing what will make us rich toward God?" "¿Imata ruwaspan Diospaq qhapaq kasun?"
"In Jesus ’ statement, being rich toward God is set in contrast with laying up material treasures for oneself, or enriching oneself materially." "Rikch’anachiyta tukushaspan Jesús sut’incharan Diospaq qhapaq kay aswan allin kasqanta kay pachapi qhapaq kaykuna huñuymantaqa."
"Thus, Jesus was saying that our main concern in life should not be the accumulation of material riches or the enjoyment of what we may possess." "Chaywanmi rikuchiran ama qhapaq kaykuna huñuypi afanakunanchista."
"Instead, we should use our resources in such a way as to enrich, or build up, our relationship with Jehovah." "Aswanmi tukuy atisqanchista ruwananchis Jehová Dioswan allinpi kananchispaq."
"Doing so will surely make us rich toward God. Why? Because it opens the door to many blessings from him." "Chayta ruwaspan Diospaq qhapaq kasun saminchaynintapas chaskisun."
"The Bible tells us: “The blessing of Jehovah ​ — that is what makes rich, and he adds no pain with it. ” ​ — Proverbs 10: 22." "Biblia niwanchis: “Señor Diospa saminchayninqa qhapaqyachinmi, chay saminchayqa manan llakichinchu ”, nispa (Proverbios 10: 22)."
"How does Jehovah’s blessing ‘ make rich ’?" "¿Imaynapin Jehová Diospa saminchaynin ‘ qhapaqyachin ’?"
"When Jehovah bestows blessings on his people, he always gives them the best." "Jehová Diosqa allin kaqkunawanmi kamachinkunata saminchan."
"For example, when Jehovah gave the Israelites a home, it was “a land flowing with milk and honey. ”" "Yachanapaq, israelitakunaman Jehová Diospa qosqan “hallp’aqa lecheq miel misk’iq askha kananmi ” karan."
"Although the land of Egypt had also been described that way, the land that Jehovah gave the Israelites was different in at least one vital respect." "Chhaynataña rimaranku Egipto suyupi hallp’amanta chaypas, israelitakunaq tiyasqan hallp’aqa hukniraymi karan. ‘ Chay hallp’ataqa [...]"
"It was “a land that Jehovah your God is caring for, ” Moses told the Israelites." "Señor Diosmi mana saqespa makilla waqaychasharan ’ israelitakunaman Moisespa nisqan hina."
"In other words, they would prosper because Jehovah would be looking after them." "Jehová Diospa waqaychasqanraykun israelitakunaqa qhapaqyananku karan."
"As long as the Israelites remained faithful to Jehovah, they were richly blessed by him and enjoyed a way of life that was visibly superior to that of all the nations round about." "Chhaynan karan, Jehová Diosta kasukuspaqa askha saminchaykunatan chaskiranku, huk suyukunamantapas aswan allinpin karanku."
"Yes, it is Jehovah’s blessing that “makes rich ”! ​ — Numbers 16: 13; Deuteronomy 4: 5 - 8; 11: 8 - 15." "Arí, Jehová Diospa saminchayninqa ‘ qhapaqyachikunmi ’ (Números 16: 13; Deuteronomio 4: 5 - 8; 11: 8 - 15)."
"What do those who are rich toward God enjoy?" "¿Imaynapin tarikunku Diospaq qhapaq kaqkuna?"
"The expression “rich toward God ” is also rendered“ rich in God’s sight ” (Today’s English Version) or “rich in the eyes of God. ”" "Diospaq qhapaq kay nisqa rimaymi t’ikrakullantaq “Diospa qhawarinanpaq qhapaq kay ” nispa (Biblia de América, español)."
"B. Phillips) Those who are rich materially are generally concerned with how they might appear in the eyes of others." "Qhapaqkunaqa allin qhawarisqa kaytan munanku, chaytataq imayna kawsasqankupi rikuchinku."
"This is often reflected in their way of life." "Runakunaq qhawarinanta munaspan ‘ kay pacha kawsaypi hatunchakunku ’."
"They want to impress people with what the Bible calls “the showy display of one’s means of life. ”" "Diospaq qhapaq kaqkunan ichaqa paypa allin qhawarisqan, khuyapayasqan ima kanku."
"In contrast, those who are rich toward God enjoy God’s approval, favor, and undeserved kindness in abundance and have a warm personal relationship with him." "Hinaspapas Dioswan hukllachasqa kashanku."
"Being in such a precious state surely gives them a sense of well - being and security, more than any material riches can provide." "Chaywanmi aswan allin aswan kusisqa kawsanku, chaytaqa manan kay pachapi qhapaq kaywan tarinkumanchu (Isaías 40: 11)."
"The question that remains is, What must we do in order to be rich in God’s eyes?" "¿Imatawanmi ruwana Diospaq qhapaq kananchispaq?"
"Rich in God’s Eyes" "Diospa qhawarinanpaq qhapaq kay"
"What must we do in order to be rich toward God?" "¿Imatawanmi ruwananchis Diospaq qhapaq kananchispaq?"
"In Jesus ’ illustration, the man planned and worked hard only to enrich himself, and he was called unreasonable." "Rikch’anachiypi runaqa qhapaq kaykunata tariyllapin yuyaykuran chayllapaqtaqmi llank’aranpas, chayrayku “mana yuyayniyoq runa ” nispa suticharan."
"To be rich toward God, therefore, we must endeavor to work hard and have a full share in the activities that are truly valuable and worthwhile in God’s eyes." "Chaymi Diospaq qhapaq kanapaqqa kallpachakunanchis aswan chaniyoq llank’aykunapi yanapakunanchispaq."
"Among these is what Jesus commanded: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations. ”" "Huknin llank’aymantan Jesús khaynata kamachiran: “Rispa llapa suyu runakunata yachachimuychis, yachachisqaykuna kanankupaq ”, nispa."
"Using our time, energy, and talents, not for self - advancement, but in the Kingdom - preaching and disciple - making work can be likened to making an investment." "Qhapaq kaykunata maskhaypi tiemponchista kallpanchistapas usuchishanamantaqa Diospa Reinonmantan willamunanchis munaqkunamantaq Bibliamanta yachachimunanchis, chhayna ruwayqa iñiyninchispin yanapawasun."
"Those who have done so have reaped rich dividends spiritually, as shown by the following experiences. ​ — Proverbs 19: 17." "Chayta qatimuq experienciakunapi rikusun (Proverbios 19: 17)."
"16, 17." "16, 17."
"What experiences can you relate to show the way of life that makes one rich in God’s eyes?" "¿Imaynapin Diospaq qhapaq kasunman?, chaymanta huk experienciata willay."
"Consider the case of a Christian man in a country in the Orient." "Qhawarisun Asia nisqapi tiyaq cristianomanta."
"He had a well - paying job as a computer technician." "Payqa computadorakunawan llank’asqanpin allin sueldota chaskiq."
"However, his work occupied practically all his time and left him feeling spiritually impoverished." "Ichaqa sinchi llank’asqanwanmi iñiyninpi chiriyapusharan."
"Finally, instead of trying to get ahead in his job, he quit and took up making ice cream and selling it on the street so that he would have more time to care for his spiritual needs and responsibilities." "Chaymi llank’ananpi astawan qolqe maskhananmantaqa, llank’ananta saqespa heladota ruwaran callekunapi vendenanpaq. ¿Imarayku chayta ruwaran?"
"Former workmates made fun of him, but how did things turn out?" "Paypa ruwanankunata espiritualpi ruwaykunatapas hunt’ananpaq."
"“Actually, I was better off financially than when I worked with computers, ” he said." "Llank’aqmasinkunaña chay ruwasqanmanta asipayaranku chaypas, pay kayta nin: “Aswan askha qolqetan ganakurani ”, nispa."
"“It has made me happier because I do not have the stress and worry that I had with my former job." "Nillantaq: “Ñawpaqtaqa manan thakpichu kawsarani llakisqallan karanipas, kunanmi ichaqa kusisqa kani."
"And most important, I now feel closer to Jehovah. ”" "Jehová Dioswan hukllachakusqaymantan astawanqa kusisqa kani ”, nispa."
"The change enabled this Christian to enter the full - time ministry, and he is now serving at the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in his country." "Allin llank’ananta saqespan precursor karan, kunantaq Betel wasipi llank’ashan."
"Jehovah’s blessing indeed “makes rich. ”" "Arí, Jehová “Diospa saminchayninqa qhapaqyachikunmi ”."
"Another example is that of a woman who grew up in a family in which education was highly valued." "Huk warmitapas erqechanmantapachan familian kallpachasqa allin profecionniyoq kananpaq."
"She attended universities in France, Mexico, and Switzerland and was headed for a promising career." "Chaymi Francia, México, Suiza nisqa suyukunapi estudiaran allin profecionniyoq kananpaq."
"“Success smiled upon me; prestige and privilege accompanied me, ” she said,“ but on the inside, there was a void, a deep dissatisfaction. ” Then she learned about Jehovah." "Paymi nin: “Allin kawsanaypaq hinapunin karan, respetasqan karani, ancha allin llank’anakunatan munachiwarankupas ichaqa manan chaykunawan kusisqachu karani ”, nispa."
"She said: “As I progressed spiritually, my desire to please Jehovah and to return a little of what he had given me helped me to see clearly the road to take ​ — serve him full - time. ”" "Biblia estudiayta qallarisqan qhepamanmi kayta niran: “Bibliamanta astawan yachaspan Diospa sonqonta kusichiyta munarani, tukuy qowasqanmanta pisillatapas kutichiyta."
"She resigned from her position and was soon baptized." "Chaymi decidekurani ima ruwanayta: tukuy tiempoywan Diospa munaynin ruwayta ”, nispa."
"For the past 20 years, she has happily served in the full - time ministry." "Ahinapin llank’ananta saqepuran, chay qhepamantaq bautizakuran."
"“Some think that I have wasted my talents, ” she relates,“ but they recognize that I am happy, and they admire the principles by which I live my life." "Payqa iskay chunka watañan tukuy tiemponwan Jehová Diospaq kusisqa llank’ashan."
"Every day I pray to Jehovah to help me to be humble so as to have his approval. ”" "Paymi nillantaq: “Wakinmi niwanku, allin kanaykitan usuchishanki nispa, ichaqa reparankun aswan kusisqa kasqayta sumaqtataqmi qhawarinku Diospa kamachikusqanman hina kawsasqaytapas. ”"
"Like Paul, how can we be rich toward God?" "¿Imatan ruwasunman apóstol Pablo hina Diospaq qhapaq kanapaq?"
"Saul, who became the apostle Paul, had a promising career ahead of him." "Apóstol Pabloman tukupuq Tarso llaqtayoq Saulopas allin profecionniyoqmi karan."
"Yet, he later wrote: “I do indeed also consider all things to be loss on account of the excelling value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. ”" "Ichaqa cristianoman tukupuspan kayta qelqaran: “Tukuy imaymanayoq kaytapas mana valeq q’opata hinan qhawani Señorniy Jesucristota reqsinaypaq ”, nispa."
"To Paul, the riches he gained through Christ excelled anything that the world could offer." "Cristorayku espiritualpi qhapaq kaykuna tarisqanmi Pablopaqqa aswan chaniyoq karan kay pachapi qhapaq kaykuna tariymantaqa."
"Likewise, by relinquishing any selfish ambitions and pursuing a life of godly devotion, we too can enjoy a life that is rich in God’s eyes." "Sichus ñoqanchispas Pablo hina mana qhapaq kaykunata munapayasunchu, Diospa kamachikusqanman hina kawsananchispaqtaq kallpachakusun chayqa, Diospaqmi qhapaq kasun."
"God’s Word assures us: “The result of humility and the fear of Jehovah is riches and glory and life. ” ​ — Proverbs 22: 4." "Biblia niwanchis: “Huch’uyyaykukuqqa Señor Diostapas manchakuqqa qhapaq kayta, hatunchasqa - kayta, unay kawsaytawanmi tarinqa ”, nispa (Proverbios 22: 4)."

"Jehovah Is a Lover of Justice" "Jehová Diosqa chanin kaytan munakun"
"“I, Jehovah, am loving justice. ” ​ — ISAIAH 61: 8." "“Ñoqaqa chanin - kaytan munakuni. ” (ISAÍAS 61: 8.)"
"1, 2. (a) What do the words “justice ” and“ injustice ” mean?" "1, 2."
"(b) What does the Bible say about Jehovah and his quality of justice?" "¿Iman chanin kay, imataq mana chanin kayri?"
"JUSTICE is defined as ‘ the quality of being impartial, fair, acting in conformity with what is morally upright and good. ’" "CHANIN kayqa mana pimanpas sayapakuspa allin kaqta ruwaymi."
"Injustice involves being unfair, prejudiced, bad, inflicting undeserved harm on others." "Mana chanin kaytaq ichaqa, wakinman sayapakuspa hukkunata millayta trataymi, mana imallamanta yanqapas qasi hukkunata ñak’arichiymi."
"Nearly 3,500 years ago, Moses wrote regarding the Universal Sovereign, Jehovah: “All his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice. ”" "Yaqa kinsa waranqa phisqa pachak wataña Moisés Tukuy Munayniyoq Jehová Diosmanta niran: “Chaninmi ruwasqankunaqa, hunt’aq Diosmi payqa, [...] chanintaq cheqaqtaqmi payqa ”, nispa (Deuteronomio 32: 4)."
"Over seven centuries later, God inspired Isaiah to record these words: “I, Jehovah, am loving justice. ”" "Qanchis pachak wata qhepatataq Diosqa Isaiasta yuyaycharan kayta qelqananpaq: “Señor Diosmi nin: Ñoqaqa chanin - kaytan munakuni ”, nispa (Isaías 61: 8)."
"Then in the first century, Paul exclaimed: “Is there injustice with God?" "Ñawpaq siglopitaq Pablo niran: “¿‘ Diosqa manan chaninchu ’ nisunchu?"
"Never may that become so! ”" "¡Manapunin imaynamantapas! ”"
"And in the same century, Peter declared: “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. ”" "nispa. Chay tiempollapitaq apóstol Pedropas niran: “Diosqa manan mayqen runatapas rikch’ayninta qhawaspachu akllan, aswanpas may suyupipas payta yupaychaspa chanin - kayta ruwaqtaqa chaskinmi ”, nispa."
"Yes, “Jehovah is a lover of justice. ” ​ — Psalm 37: 28; Malachi 3: 6." "Arí, Jehová Diosqa “chanin runatan munakun ” (Salmo 37: 28; Malaquías 3: 6)."
"Injustice Prevails" "Mana chanin kayqa sinchi mast’arisqan kashan"
"How did injustice on earth originate?" "¿Imaynapin kay pachapi qallariran mana chanin kay?"
"Justice is not a prevailing quality today." "Chanin kayqa chinkapushanmi."
"We can become victims of unjust acts at all levels of society ​ — at our place of work, in school, in our dealings with officials, and in other ways — ​ even in the family circle." "Mana chanin ruwaykunan ichaqa maypipas rikukushallan: llank’anapi, escuelapi, familia ukhupi, kamachikuqkunapipas."
"Of course, such injustices are not new." "Ichaqa manan kay tiempollanchispichu mana chanin ruwaykunataqa rikukun."
"They came upon the human family when our first parents rebelled and became lawless, spurred on by the rebellious spirit creature who became Satan the Devil." "Mana chanin ruwaykunaqa kay pachapi qallariran ñawpa tayta mamanchis huk angelpa kallpachasqan Dios contra huchallikuqtinku, chay millay angelmi Satanasman tukuran."
"It surely was unjust for Adam, Eve, and Satan to misuse the wonderful gift of free will that Jehovah had granted them." "Adanpas Evapas Satanaspas kikillankumantan mana chaninta ruwaranku Diospa contranpi huchallikuspa."
"Their wrong actions would result in enormous suffering and death for the entire human family. ​ — Genesis 3: 1 - 6; Romans 5: 12; Hebrews 2: 14." "Chayraykun lliw runa ñak’ariyman wañuyman huchachasqa kanchis (Génesis 3: 1 - 6; Romanos 5: 12; Hebreos 2: 14)."
"For how long has injustice been part of human history?" "¿Hayk’a tiempoña kay pachapi mana chaninkunata ruwakushan?"
"For some 6,000 years since the rebellion in Eden, injustice has been part of human society." "Diospa contranpi hatarisqankumantaqa soqta waranqa watañan pasarun, llapa chay watakunapitaq runakunaqa mana chaninta ruwashallankupuni."
"This could well be expected because Satan is the god of this world." "Satanasmi kay pacha kamachiq dios, chaymi runakunaqa mana chaninta kawsanku."
"He is a liar and the father of the lie, a slanderer and a resister of Jehovah." "Payqa llullan, llullakunaq taytantaq kanpas; payqa Jehová Diosmanta mana chaninta rimaspa contranpi churakun."
"He has always perpetrated gross injustices." "Satanasqa sinchi mana chaninkunallatapunin ruwan."
"For example, in part because of Satan’s evil influence before the Flood of Noah’s day, God noted that “the badness of man was abundant in the earth and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time. ”" "Manaraq Millp’uq para unu chayamushaqtinmi Diosqa rikuran “kay pachapi runakunaq sinchi mana allin kasqanta, sonqonkuq lliw yuyaykusqanpas mana allinllapuni kasqantawan ”, chhaynatan runakuna kawsasharanku Saqraq pantachisqanrayku (Génesis 6: 5)."
"That situation still prevailed in the time of Jesus. He said: “Sufficient for each day is its own badness, ” meaning its own distressing problems, such as injustice." "Kaqllataqmi karan Jesuspa tiemponpipas, chaymi Jesús niran: “Sapa p’unchay llakikuyqa chay p’unchayllapaq kachun ”, nispa, chaywanqa nisharan sapa p’unchay ñak’ariykunamanta, mana chanin ruwaykunamantawan."
"The Bible so accurately says: “All creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together until now. ” ​ — Romans 8: 22." "Chayrayku Biblia sut’illantapuni nin: “Yachankichismi Diospa tukuy imaymana kamasqankunaqa kunankama waqasqankuta muchusqankutapas ”, nispa."
"Why are there more injustices in our time than ever before?" "¿Imaraykun astawan yapakushan mana chanin ruwaykuna?"
"Thus, bad things resulting in gross injustices have been happening throughout human history." "Yachasqanchispas hina, runaqa ñawpa tiempomantaraqmi mana chaninkunata ruwashan."
"Now the situation is worse than ever. Why?" "Kunanqa aswan millaytaraqmi runaqa kawsashan."
"Because this present ungodly system of things has been in its “last days ” for many decades, experiencing“ critical times hard to deal with ” as it nears its end." "Yachasqanchis hina unayñan kay pacha ‘ tukukuy qaylla p’unchaykunapi ’ kashan; tiempoq pasasqanman hinataq aswan sinchi ‘ sasa tiempokunaman ’ chayashanchis."
"The Bible foretold that during this period in history, people would be “lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self - assuming, haughty, blasphemers,... unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self - control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride. ”" "Bibliaq willasqan hina, kay tiempopi runakunaqa kananku karan “kikinkuta munakuqkuna, qolqe sonqokuna, alabakuqkuna, hatunchakuqkuna, runamasinkuta k’amiqkuna, [...] mana reqsikuqkuna, Diosta mana manchakuqkuna, mana munakuyniyoqkuna, mana khuyapayakuqkuna, yanqa qasi tumpakuqkuna, aychankuq munaynillanta ruwaqkuna, millay yana alma runakuna, tukuy allinkaqta cheqnikuqkuna, amigonkunata hap’iykachiqkuna, waq’a hina ruwaqkuna, pay - payman tukuqkuna ima ”."

"What huge injustices have afflicted the human family in modern times?" "¿Ima mana chanin ruwaykunatan kay tiempopi runakuna ruwashan?"
"The past hundred years have seen injustices on a scale never before experienced." "Kay pachak qhepa watakunapin sinchi mana chanin ruwaykunata rikukuran."
"For one thing, these years have been the most war - torn." "Chay watakunapin askha guerrakuna karan."
"For example, some historians estimate that in World War II alone, the dead totaled from some 50 million to 60 million, the majority of whom were civilians ​ — innocent men, women, and children." "Wakin historiadorkunaq nisqanman hina, segunda guerra mundial nisqallapis wañunman karan phisqa chunka otaq soqta chunka millón runakuna, aswantaqa wañuranku mana soldado runakuna, paykuna karanku qharikuna, warmikuna, wawakuna ima."
"Since that war ended, millions more have been killed in various conflicts, the majority again being civilians." "Chay guerra tukuqtintaq waranqanpi runakuna wañullarankutaq huk guerrakunapi, chaypipas mana soldado runakunan aswantaqa wañuranku."
"Satan promotes such injustices because he is in a rage, knowing that soon Jehovah will totally defeat him." "Satanasmi chay mana chaninkunata ruwachin, payqa yachanmi Jehová Dios pisi tiempollamanta atipananta."
"Bible prophecy puts it this way: “The Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time. ” ​ — Revelation 12: 12." "Biblian kayta willaranña: “Saqran qankunaman uraykamun, sinchi phiñasqan kashan, tiempoqa pisillaña kananta yachaspa ”, nispa."
"Global military spending is now about a trillion dollars each year." "Ichaqa millonninpi runakunan mana ima necesitasqankuta rantiyta atinkuchu wakcha kasqankurayku."
"Hundreds of millions of people do not have the necessities of life, so think of the good all that money could do if spent on peaceful pursuits." "Sichus armakuna ruwaypi qolqe gastasqankuta churankuman allin kaqkunata ruwanankupaq chayqa, may allinchá kanman."
"About one billion people do not have enough to eat, while others have an abundance." "Yaqa waranqa millón runakunan pisichikunku mikhunamanta, wakintaq ichaqa wikch’unkuraq mikhunata."
"According to a United Nations source, about five million children die from the effects of hunger each year." "Naciones Unidas nisqan hina, sapa watas phisqa millón wawakuna wañunku yarqaymanta."
"How unjust!" "¡Chayqa mana chaninpunin!"
"Then, too, consider the many innocents who are killed by abortions. Estimates vary from 40 million to 60 million worldwide every year!" "Chaymantapas sapa watas tawa chunka otaq soqta chunka millón wawachakunata wañuchinku mamanpa wiksallanpiraq kashaqtin."
"What a horrendous injustice!" "¡Chayqa sinchi mana chaninpunin!"
"How only can true justice for humankind come about?" "¿Pillan runakunapaq chanin kayta apamunman?"
"Human rulers are not finding solutions to the vast problems plaguing mankind today; nor will the situation get better because of human efforts." "Kay pachapi kamachiqkunaqa manan atishankuchu runakunaq ñak’ariynin tukuchiyta, manataqmi hayk’aqpas atinqakuchu."
"God’s Word foretold that in our time “wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled. ”" "Kay tiemponchismanta rimaspa Diospa Simin Qelqa willaranña: “Millay runakunapas q’otuq runakunapas aswan - aswanraqmi mana chanin - kayman chayanqaku, q’otuspanku q’otuchikuspanku ima ”, nispa."
"Injustice is so much a part of the fabric of daily living that men cannot remove it." "Mana chanin kayqa sinchi mast’arisqan kashan, chaymi runaqa mana atinchu chinkachiyta."
"Only the God of justice can remove it." "Chanin Diosllan atinman chinkachiyta."
"Only he can remove Satan, the demons, and evil humans. ​ — Jeremiah 10: 23, 24." "Payllan Satanastapas, supaykunatapas, millay runakunatapas chinkachinman (Jeremías 10: 23, 24)."

"9, 10." "9, 10."
"Why did Asaph become disheartened?" "¿Imaraykun Asaf iñiyninpi chiriyaran?"
"In the past, even some Bible writers wondered why God had not already intervened in human affairs and ushered in true justice and righteousness." "Ñawpa tiempopiqa Dios sonqo runakunapas tapukurankun: ¿Imarayku Dios manaraq tukuchinchu mana chaninkunata?"
"Take, for example, one particular man in Bible times." "nispa. Huk runamanta yachasun."
"The superscription to Psalm 73 provides the name Asaph, referring either to a prominent Levite musician during the reign of King David or to the musicians of the house of which Asaph was the paternal head." "Salmos 73 textoq umanpi qelqasqa kashan Asaf suti, yaqapaschá karan Davidpa tiemponpi Leví ayllumanta allin tocaq runa, otaq Asafpa mirayninmanta mayqen tocaqpas."
"Asaph and his descendants wrote many musical compositions that were used in public worship." "Asafpas mirayninpas qelqarankun askha yupaychay takikunata."
"Yet, at one point in his life, the writer of this psalm became spiritually downhearted." "Ichaqa huk tiempon Asaf iñiyninpi chiriyaran."
"He saw the material prosperity of wicked men, and he noticed that they often seemed to be content with their life, not experiencing any adverse consequences." "Asafqa qhawariran millay runakunaq qhapaqyasqanta, llakhilla kasqankuta, mana ima sasachakuypi tarikusqankutapas."
"We read: “I became envious of the boasters, when I would see the very peace of wicked people." "Asafmi niran: “Millaykunaq qhapaqyasqanta rikuspaymi hatunchakuqkunata envidiakurqani."
"For they have no deathly pangs; and their paunch is fat." "Manan paykunaqa llakikunkuchu, qhalillapunin kanku."
"They are not even in the trouble of mortal man, and they are not plagued the same as other men. ”" "Manan runakuna hinapunichu muchunku, manan wakinkuna hinapaschu sasachaykunata rikunku ”, nispa (Salmo 73: 2 - 8)."
"But in time that Bible writer came to realize that such a negative viewpoint was wrong." "Qhepamantaqmi ichaqa reparakuran pantasqanta (Salmo 73: 15, 16)."
"The psalmist tried to adjust his thinking, but he could not fully comprehend why the wicked seemed to get away with doing wrong while rightly disposed people often suffered." "Chaymi mana allin yuyaykusqanta cambiaran, ichaqa manaraqmi entienderanchu imarayku millay runakuna llakhilla kawsanku, chanin runakunataq ñak’arinku chayta."
"What did the psalmist Asaph come to understand?" "¿Imatan Asaf entienderan?"
"David wrote: “Hope in Jehovah and keep his way, and he will exalt you to take possession of the earth." "Chaymantan Asafqa entienderan Jehová Dios millay runakunamanta cuenta mañananta (Salmo 73: 17 - 19)."
"When the wicked ones are cut off, you will see it. ” ​ — Psalm 37: 9, 11, 34." "Davidmi qelqaran: “Señor Diosta suyakuy, simintapas kasukuy, paytaqmi hatunchasunki hallp’ata chaskinaykipaq, ñawiykiwanmi rikunki millaykunaq wañurasqanta ”, nispa (Salmo 37: 9, 11, 34)."

"(b) How do you feel about that solution to the problem of injustice?" "b) ¿Imaninkin mana chanin kawsayta Jehová Dios tukuchinanmanta?"
"For a certainty, it is Jehovah’s purpose to eliminate wickedness and its accompanying injustices from this earth in his own due time." "Tiempollanpin Jehová Diosqa mana chanin kawsayta tukuchinqa."
"That is something of which even loyal Christians should remind themselves regularly." "Cheqaq cristianokunapas yuyaymanashanallanchismi chaypi."
"Jehovah is going to remove those who go contrary to his will, and he will reward those who live in harmony with it." "Ama qonqasunchu, Jehová Diosqa paypa contranpi kaqkunataqa wañuchinqan, paypa munayninta ruwaqkunatataqmi ichaqa sumaqta qhawarinqa."
"“His own eyes behold, his own beaming eyes examine the sons of men." "“Payqa runakunatan qhawamushan, ruwasqankutan t’aqwimushan."
"Jehovah himself examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one, and anyone loving violence His soul certainly hates." "Señor Diosqa chanin runakunatan t’aqwimun, ichaqa millay runakunatapas maqaylla maqaqkunatapas cheqnikunmi."
"He will rain down upon the wicked ones traps, fire and sulphur and a scorching wind..." "Millay runakunataqa muchuchinqan, sansakunawan rawrashaq azufrepiwan. Ruphashaq wayran paykunataqa hasut’inqa."

"A New World of Justice" "Mosoq pachapi chanin kay t’ikarinqa"

"Why will righteousness and justice prevail in the new world?" "¿Imaraykun mosoq pachapi t’ikarinqa chanin kay?"
"When Jehovah destroys this unjust system of things that is under Satan’s control, He will usher in a glorious new world." "Maypachachus Jehová Dios tukuchinqa Satanaspa kamachisqan kay pachata, chayraqmi qallarinqa mosoq pacha."
"It will be controlled by God’s heavenly Kingdom, for which Jesus taught his followers to pray." "Chay mosoq pachatan Diospa Reinon kamachimunqa hanaq pachamanta, chayta mañakunankupaqmi Jesús yachachiran qatikuqninkunata."
"Wickedness and injustice will be replaced by righteousness and justice, for then the prayer will be answered in the fullest sense: “Let your kingdom come." "Chaypachan chanin kayqa pachantinpi mast’arikunqa, chinkapunqataq mana allin kawsay mana chanin kawsaypas, hinan hunt’akunqa kay mañakuy: “Qhapaqsuyuyki [‘ Reinoyki ’, NM] hamuchun, munayniyki kay pachapi ruwakuchun, imaynan hanaq pachapipas ruwakun hinata ”, nispa."

"Regarding the King Jesus Christ, Isaiah 9: 7 foretells: “To the abundance of the princely rule and to peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom in order to establish it firmly and to sustain it by means of justice and by means of righteousness, from now on and to time indefinite." "Rey Jesucristomanta Isaías 9: 7 textopas nillantaq: “Davidpa kamachikuy tiyananpin tiyanqa, kamachikuy atiyninqa hinantinmanmi mast’arikunqa, thak - kaypas manan tukukunqachu.

"In God’s new world, we will no longer have reason to express the words we find at Ecclesiastes 4: 1: “I myself returned that I might see all the acts of oppression that are being done under the sun, and, look!" "Mosoq pachapiqa manañan pipas ninqañachu Eclesiastés 4: 1 textoq nisqanta: “Rikullarqanitaqmi kay pachapi tukuy sarunchaykunatapas."

"Yes, Jehovah will correct everything that is wrong, doing so in a way that is far beyond our expectations." "Jehová Diosqa tukuy mana allinkunata allichanqa, yuyaykusqanchismantapas aswan allintaraqmi ruwanqa."
"How appropriate that Jehovah God inspired the apostle Peter to write: “There are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell ”! ​ — 2 Peter 3: 13." "Chaychá Jehová Diosqa apóstol Pedrota yuyaycharan kayta qelqananpaq: “Ñoqanchismi ichaqa Diospa prometewasqanchis mosoq hanaq pachata mosoq hallp’a pachatawan suyashanchis, chaykunapiqa tukuy imapas chaninkaman kanqa ”, nispa."
"How has the “new heavens ” been established, and in what sense is the“ new earth ” being prepared today?" "¿Imaynapin ‘ mosoq hanaq pachapas ’ ‘ mosoq hallp’a pachapas ’ takyasqaña kashan?"
"Indeed, the “new heavens, ” God’s heavenly government in the hands of Christ, has been set in place already." "Chay ‘ mosoq hanaq pachaqa ’ (otaq Cristoq umallisqan hanaq pacha gobierno) ñan takyachisqaña kashan."
"Those who will form the nucleus of the “new earth, ” a new earthly society of rightly disposed people, are being gathered during these last days." "‘ Mosoq hallp’a pachapas ’ (otaq mosoq pachapi tiyayta qallariqkunaqa) huñusqañan kashanku kay tukukuy p’unchaykunapi."
"They are already nearly seven million strong, in at least 235 lands and in some 100,000 congregations." "Yaqa qanchis millón runakunañan kashanku 235 nacionkunapiña, yaqa pachak waranqa congregacionkunapitaq huñunakushanku."
"These millions have been learning the righteous and just ways of Jehovah, and as a result, worldwide they enjoy a unity that is cemented by Christian love." "Paykunaqa Jehová Diospa chanin kamachikuyninkunata yachaspa, cheqaqta munanakuspa huk nisqalla kawsanku."
"Their unity is the most pronounced and enduring in the history of the world, a unity exceeding anything experienced by Satan’s subjects." "Satanaspa kamachisqan pachapi tiyaq runakunaqa manan hayk’aqpas Diospa llaqtan hina huk nisqalla kawsarankuchu."
"Such love and unity are foregleams of the marvelous time to come in God’s new world, which will be governed in righteousness and justice. ​ — Isaiah 2: 2 - 4; John 13: 34, 35; Colossians 3: 14." "Sumaq kawsasqankuqa rikuchishanñan mosoq pachapi kusi kawsay kananta, chaypi tiyaq runakunaqa chanin kayman hinapuni kamachisqa kanqaku (Isaías 2: 2 - 4; Juan 13: 34, 35; Colosenses 3: 14)."
"Satan’s Attack to Fail" "Satanaspa phawaykusqanqa mana imapin tukunqa"
"Why is Satan’s final attack on Jehovah’s people certain to fail?" "Satanasqa manan atipanqachu Diospa llaqtanman phawaykuspaqa, ¿imaynapin chayta yachanchis?"
"Satan and his followers will soon come against Jehovah’s worshippers in an attempt to stamp them out." "Satanaspas paywan kaqkunapas as pisi tiempollamantan Jehová Diospa llaqtanman phawaykunqaku wañuchiy yuyaywan (Ezequiel 38: 14 - 23)."
"That will be part of what Jesus called the “great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again. ”" "Jesusqa willaranmi ‘ manchay ñak’ariy ’ tiempopi chay kananta, paypa nisqan hina, chay manchay ñak’ariy hinaqa “manan hayk’aqpas kay pacha qallariymantapacha kunankama karqanchu, manataqmi kanqapaschu ”."
"Will Satan’s attack succeed?" "¿Atipanqachu Satanás?"
No. Manan.
"God’s Word assures us: “Jehovah is a lover of justice, and he will not leave his loyal ones." "Diospa Simin Qelqa nin: “Señor Diosqa chanin runatan munakun, manan pay sonqo runataqa saqerparinchu."
"To time indefinite they will certainly be guarded; but as for the offspring of the wicked ones, they will indeed be cut off." "Wiñaypaqmi paykunaqa waqaychasqa kanqaku, millay runakunaq mirayninmi ichaqa chinkachisqa kanqaku."
"The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it. ” ​ — Psalm 37: 28, 29." "Chanin runakunaqa kay hallp’atan hap’ikapunqaku, chaypin wiñaypaq tiyanqaku ”, nispa (Salmo 37: 28, 29)."
"(a) How will God react to Satan’s coming attack on His people?" "a) ¿Imatan Dios ruwanqa Satanás llaqtanman phawaykuqtin?"
"(b) Why has it been good for you to review this Bible - based information about the triumph of justice?" "b) Chanin kaypa atipananmanta yachasqayki, ¿imaynata kallpachasunki?"
"The attack by Satan and his horde on Jehovah’s servants will be the final insult." "Satanaspas paywan kaqkunapas chay kutillatawanña Diospa llaqtanman phawaykunqaku."
"Jehovah foretold through Zechariah: “He that is touching you is touching my eyeball. ”" "Jehová Diosmi profeta Zacariaswan qelqachiranña: “Pipas qankunata tupaykuqqa ñawi ruruytan tupaykun ”, nispa (Zacarías 2: 8)."
"It is as if someone were thrusting a finger in Jehovah’s eyeball." "Pipas ñawinchisman dedonta churaykunman chayqa kaqpachallan horqosunman, chay hinallataq Jehová Diospas kaqpacha wañuchinqa llaqtanman phawaykuqkunata."
"He will respond immediately and eliminate the perpetrators. Jehovah’s servants are the most loving, united, peaceful, law - abiding people on earth." "Llapa runakunamantaqa Diospa kamachinkunan kanku aswan llamp’u sonqo, munakuq, sumaqta kawsaqkuna, kasukuqkuna ima; chayrayku paykunaman phawaykusqankuqa manapuni chaninchu."
"So that attack against them will be totally unwarranted, unjust. The great “lover of justice ” will not tolerate it." "Diosqa ‘ chanin runa ’ munakuqtaq chayqa, manan hinallatachu qhawanqa, aswanpas llaqtanman phawaykuqkunata wiñaypaq wañuchinqa, chhaynapin mana chanin kayta chinkachinqa llaqtantataq qespichinqa."
"His acting in their behalf will result in the eternal destruction of the enemies of his people, in the triumph of justice, and in the salvation of those who worship the only true God." "¡Maytan kusikunchis chay p’unchay qayllaykamushasqanta yachaspa!"

"NO NORMAL person wants to suffer; neither does our Creator, Jehovah God, want humans to suffer." "MANAN pi runapas munanchu ñak’ariytaqa, nitaqmi Kamaqninchis Jehová Diospas munanchu."
"We can see this when we examine his inspired Word and note what took place following his creation of man and woman." "Chaytan Biblia sut’inchawanchis runa kamasqan qhepaman."
"First, God made the man." "Jehová Diosqa ñawpaqta qharita kamaran."
"“Jehovah God proceeded to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man came to be a living soul. ”" "“Ñut’u hallp’amanta Señor Diosqa runata ruwarqan, hinaspa kawsay samayta senqanman samaykurqan, chaymi runaqa kawsashaq kapurqan. ” (Génesis 2: 7.)"
"Adam was perfect in body and mind, and he did not have to get sick or die." "Adanqa ch’uya yuyayniyoq ch’uya cuerpoyoqmi karan, chayrayku mana imamanta onqonanchu karan nitaq wañunanpaschu karan."
"What about Adam’s living conditions?" "¿Imanisunmantaq tiyasqan cheqasmanta?"

"Thus Jehovah God made to grow out of the ground every tree desirable to one’s sight and good for food. ”" "Señor Diosmi hallp’amanta phutuchimurqan lliw munayllaña sach’akunata, mikhunapaqpas sumaqta. ”"
"Yes, Adam had a marvelous home." "(Génesis 2: 8, 9.)"
"There was no suffering in Eden." "Edén huertapiqa manan ñak’ariy karanchu."
"What prospects did the first human couple have?" "¿Imaynatan kawsananku karan Adanwan Evawan?"

"The Bible further informs us: “God blessed them and God said to them: ‘ Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it. ’ ”" "Ñawpa tayta mamanchisqa kay pachantintan sumaq Paraisoman tukuchinanku karan."
"The first human pair would have the wonderful privilege of expanding the Paradise of Eden until, in time, it covered the earth, making a global paradise." "Chaymantapas wawankunawan kuska kusisqa kawsananku karan mana ñak’arispa."
"And they would produce happy offspring, who would be free from suffering." "¡Ima sumaqmi karan qallariypi kawsasqankuqa!"
"What a magnificent beginning! ​ — Genesis 1: 31." "(Génesis 1: 31.)"
"Suffering Begins" "Imaynapin ñak’ariy paqariran"
"From a historical standpoint, what is obvious about humankind?" "Runaq kawsasqanta qhawarispa, ¿imatan sut’ita rikunchis?"
"Yet, when we look at the condition of the human family down through history, it is obvious that something went horribly wrong." "Runaq imayna kawsasqanta qhawarispa reparanchis qallariypi sumaq kawsay chinkapusqanta."
"Bad things have happened, and the human family has suffered greatly." "Hatun llakikuykuna ñak’ariykunan runakunata muchuchin."
"Over the centuries, all of Adam and Eve’s descendants have become sick, have grown old, and have eventually died." "Ñawpaqmantapachan Adanpa mirayninqa onqoranku, machuyaranku, wañurankupas."

"How were our first parents involved in introducing suffering into the human family?" "¿Imatan ruwaranku ñawpa tayta mamanchis kay pachapi ñak’ariy paqarinanpaq?"
"Jehovah is not to blame for the enormous suffering that has existed for so long." "Manan Jehová Dioschu huchayoq ñak’ariykuna kasqanmantaqa (2 Samuel 22: 31)."
"Part of the blame must be placed on humans. “They have acted ruinously, they have acted detestably in their dealing. ”" "Wakinpiqa runakunan huchayoq kanku ‘ waqllipusqankurayku, millaykunata ruwasqankuraykupiwan ’ (Salmo 14: 1)."
"Our first parents were given everything good as a start." "Ñawpa tayta mamanchispaqqa tukuy imaymananmi karan ch’uya kawsayniyoqtaq karankupas."
"All that was required for such to continue was obedience to God, but Adam and Eve chose to pursue independence from Jehovah." "Chay hinalla kawsayninku kashananpaqqa Diostan kasukunanku karan, ichaqa iskayninkun Jehová Diosmanta t’aqakapuranku."
"Since our first parents pulled away from Jehovah, they would no longer be sustained as perfect by him. They would deteriorate until death overtook them." "Jehová Diosmanta t’aqakapusqankurayku manaña ch’uya runañachu kapuranku, hinan machuyaspa wañupuranku."
"Imperfection has been passed on to us. ​ — Genesis 3: 17 - 19; Romans 5: 12." "Llapa mirayninmantaq saqewaranchis huchata (Génesis 3: 17 - 19; Romanos 5: 12)."
"What part did Satan play in originating suffering?" "¿Imaynapin Satanaspas huchayoq karan ñak’ariy paqarisqanmanta?"
"Also involved in the beginning of all suffering is the spirit creature who came to be called Satan the Devil." "Satanasman tukuq angelpas huchayoqmi karan ñak’ariy paqarisqanmantaqa."
"He had been endowed with free will. However, he misused that faculty in an attempt to receive worship." "Kay angelqa payta yupaychanata munaspa mana allintachu utilizaran Diospa qosqan akllakuy atiyta."
"Yet, only Jehovah should be worshipped, not his creations." "Jehová Diosllan yupaychaytaqa chaskinan, manataq mayqen kamasqanpas."
"It was Satan who induced Adam and Eve to seek independence from Jehovah, as if they could thus “be like God, knowing good and bad. ” ​ — Genesis 3: 5." "Satanasmi ichaqa payta yupaychanata munaspa Adanta Evatawan tanqaran Jehová Diosmanta t’aqakunankupaq, kay hinatan paykunata niran: ‘ Dios hina allinkaqta mana allinkaqta reqsinkichis ’, nispa (Génesis 3: 5)."
"Only Jehovah Has the Right to Rule" "Jehová Diosllan kamachiqqa kanan"
"What do the consequences of rebellion against Jehovah demonstrate?" "Jehová Diospa contranpi churakusqankumanta sasachakuykuna kasqan, ¿imatan rikuchin?"
"The bad consequences of rebellion demonstrate that only Jehovah, the Universal Sovereign, has the right to rule and that only his rule is righteous." "Diospa contranpi churakusqankumanta sasachakuykuna kasqanmi rikuchin, Hinantinpi Qollana Jehová Dioslla kamachiq kananta, paypa kamachisqallan chanin kasqantapas."
"The past thousands of years have demonstrated that Satan, who became “the ruler of this world, ” has developed a wicked, unrighteous, and violent rulership that is completely unsatisfactory." "Satanasmi tukupuran ‘ kay pacha kamachikuqman ’, waranqa - waranqa watakunaq pasasqanpitaq rikukushan Satanaspa kamachisqan millay mana chanin kasqanta."
"The long, miserable rulership of humans under Satan’s control has also demonstrated that they lack the ability to rule in righteousness." "Satanaspa yanapayninwan runakunaq kamachisqanpipas rikukullantaqmi runakuna mana chanin kamachiy atisqankuta (Jeremías 10: 23)."
"Thus, every conceivable type of rulership apart from Jehovah’s must result in failure." "Diosmanta karunchakuspa runakunaq imayna kamachikuyta yuyaykusqankuqa mana allinpipuni tukunqa."
"History has proved this beyond any doubt." "Chaytan sut’itapuni rikuchin tukuy tiempo runakunaq kamachisqan."
"What is Jehovah’s purpose as to all forms of human rulership, and how will he accomplish that purpose?" "¿Imatan Jehová Dios ruwanqa kay pachapi gobiernokunawan, imaynatataq chayta ruwanqa?"
"Now that Jehovah has allowed thousands of years for humans to experiment with rulership independent from him, he is justified in clearing all these forms of rule off the earth and replacing them with his own government." "Jehová Diosqa unayña hinallata qhawaran runakuna paymanta t’aqakuspa imaymana clase gobiernokunawan kamachikunankuta, chayraykun tukuchinqa llapa kay pachapi gobiernokunata paypa gobiernollantaq qhepanqa."
"A prophecy about this says: “In the days of those kings [human rulerships] the God of heaven will set up a kingdom [his heavenly government in the hands of Christ] that will never be brought to ruin...." "Biblian willaranña: “Chay reykuna [kay pachapi gobiernokuna] kamachikushaqtinmi, Hanaq Pacha Diosqa mana hayk’aq thunikuq suyuta [Diospa gobiernonpi Cristoq umallisqanta] sayarichinqa, [...] llapa suyukunatan ñut’uspa tukunqa, wiñaypaqtaq kanqapas ”, nispa (Daniel 2: 44)."
"It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite. ”" "Saqrawan supaykunawan kay pachata kamachisqanku, runakunaq kamachisqanpas manaña kapunqañachu."
"Demonic and human rule will cease, and only God’s heavenly Kingdom will exist and rule the earth." "Diospa Reinollanña qhepanqa teqsimuyuntinta kamachinanpaq."
"Christ will be the King, and he will have as corulers 144,000 faithful humans taken from the earth. ​ — Revelation 14: 1." "Diospa Reinonpi Reyqa Jesucriston, kay pachamanta akllasqa 144.000 hunt’aq runakunan paywan kuska kamachimunqaku."
"Benefiting From Suffering" "Allinninchispaqmi ñak’ariykunapi qaqata sayayqa"
"9, 10." "9, 10."
"How did Jesus benefit from the things he suffered?" "¿Imaynatan Jesusta yanaparan ñak’arisqan?"
"It is of interest to examine the qualifications of those who will rule in the heavenly Kingdom." "Diospa Reinonpi kamachikuqkuna imayna wakichisqa kasqankuta t’aqwiriyqa allinpunin."
"First, Christ Jesus showed how well - suited he is for his role as King." "Qhawarisun imayna wakichisqa kashan Jesús Rey kananpaq."
"He had spent untold ages of time alongside Jehovah doing his Father’s will, being His “master worker. ”" "Payqa ñawpa tiempomantaraqmi Taytanpa munayninta ruwaran ‘ llank’aqmasin ’ kaspa (Proverbios 8: 22 - 31, Edición 1988)."
"When Jehovah arranged for him to come to the earth, Jesus willingly complied." "Jesusta Jehová Dios hallp’aman hamunanpaq kamachiqtinpas payqa tukuy sonqomanta kasukuran."
"There he focused on telling others about Jehovah’s sovereignty and Kingdom." "Hallp’api kashaspataq runakunaman rimayta qallariran Diospa Reinonmanta Jehová Dioslla hinantinpi qollana kasqanmantawan."
"Jesus set an excellent example for all of us by being totally submissive to that sovereignty. ​ — Matthew 4: 17; 6: 9." "Taytanta llapallanpi kasukusqanwan ñoqanchisman allin ejemplota saqewanchis."
"Jesus suffered persecution, and finally he was put to death." "Jesustaqa qatiykacharankun, qhepamantaq wañuchiranku."
"During his ministry, he was able to note all around him the pitiful condition of humankind." "Chaymantapas Hallp’api Diospa Siminta willashaspa rikuran runakunaq ñak’arisqanta."
"Was there any benefit to him for having seen that and for having suffered personally?" "¿Yanaparanchu Jesusta ñak’arisqan runakunaq ñak’arisqanta rikusqanpas?"
Yes. Arí.
"Hebrews 5: 8 states: “Although he was a Son [of God], he learned obedience from the things he suffered. ”" "Hebreos 5: 8 texto nin: “Chay hinapin Churi kashaspapas muchusqanwan kasukuyta yacharqan ”, nispa."
"Jesus ’ experience while on the earth made him more understanding and compassionate." "Jesustaqa yanaparanmi muchusqan runakunaq muchusqanta rikusqanpas, aswan khuyapayakuq llamp’u sonqo ima kananpaq."
"He experienced firsthand the human family’s condition." "Pay kikinpuni rikuran runakunaq ñak’arisqanta."
"He could sympathize with those who suffer and could better appreciate his role in coming to their rescue." "Chaymi llakipayaran ñak’ariq runakunata, entienderantaq runakuna ñak’ariyninpi paypa yanapayninta necesitasqankuta."
"Note how the apostle Paul highlights this in the book of Hebrews: “He was obliged to become like his ‘ brothers ’ in all respects, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, in order to offer propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of the people." "Chay hinata apóstol Pablo Hebreos qelqapi niran: “Chaypaqtaq tukuy imapipas wawqenkuna hinapuni kanan karqan. Ahinapi Diospa ñawpaqenpi khuyapayakuq hunt’aq uma sacerdote karqan, runakunaq huchankunatapas wañusqan sacrificiowan pampachachinanpaq."
"For in that he himself has suffered when being put to the test, he is able to come to the aid of those who are being put to the test. ”" "Pay kikinmi ñak’arirqan wateqasqa kaspa, chayraykun payqa wateqasqakunatapas yanapayta atin ”, nispa."
"“We have as high priest, not one who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tested in all respects like ourselves, but without sin." "“Uma sacerdotenchisqa pisi kallpa kashaqtinchispas khuyapayawanchispunin, payqa ñoqanchis hinan imaymanapi wateqasqa karqan, ichaqa manan huchallikurqanchu."
"Let us, therefore, approach with freeness of speech to the throne of undeserved kindness, that we may obtain mercy and find undeserved kindness for help at the right time. ” ​ — Hebrews 2: 17, 18; 4: 14 - 16; Matthew 9: 36; 11: 28 - 30." "Chay hinaqa, ama manchakuspa Diospa khuyapayakuq qayllanman chimpaykusunchis khuyapayawananchispaq, yanapaykuna kashaqtinchispas yanapaykuwananchispaq. ”"
"How will the experience on earth of the future kings and priests benefit them as rulers?" "¿Imaynatan hamuq tiempopi reykunata sacerdotekunatapas yanapan Hallp’api ñak’arisqanku?"
"Much the same could be said of the 144,000, who “were bought ” from the earth to be corulers with Christ Jesus in the heavenly Kingdom." "Kaqllatataqmi nisunman 144.000 runakunamantapas, paykunan Hallp’amanta “rantisqa ” kanku hanaq pachamanta Jesucristowan kuska kamachimunankupaq."
"They were all born as humans on earth, grew up in a world surrounded by suffering, and suffered themselves." "Llapallankun kay pachapi kashaspanku rikuranku runamasinkuq ñak’arisqanta, paykunapas ñak’ariranku."
"Many were persecuted, and some were even killed because of keeping their integrity to Jehovah and being willing to follow Jesus." "Jesusta qatikusqankurayku Jehová Diospaq hunt’aq kasqankuraykupiwan wakinqa qatiykachasqa karanku, wakintaq wañuchisqa karanku."
"But they ‘ did not become ashamed of the witness about their Lord, taking their part in suffering evil for the good news. ’" "Manataqmi ‘ p’enqakurankuchu Señorninchismanta willayta, allin willakuykunarayku ñak’ariytapas ’."
"Their experience on earth makes them particularly qualified to judge the human family from heaven." "Hallp’api muchusqankun paykunata allinta wakichin hanaq pachamantapacha runakunata juzgamunankupaq."
"They have learned to be more sympathetic, kind, and eager to help people. ​ — Revelation 5: 10; 14: 2 - 5; 20: 6." "Kunanqa yachankun aswan khuyapayakuq kayta llamp’u sonqo kaytapas, maytataq munashanku runakuna yanapayta."
"Happiness of Those With an Earthly Hope" "Hallp’api tiyayta suyakuqkunapaq kusikuy"
"12, 13." "12, 13."
"How can those with an earthly hope benefit from suffering?" "¿Imaynatan yanapan Hallp’api wiñay kawsayta suyakuqkunata ñak’ariykunapi qaqata sayasqanku?"
"Can present suffering produce anything good in those who hope to live forever on a paradise earth free from sickness, sorrow, and death?" "Mana onqospa, mana muchuspa paraisopi wiñaypaq tiyayta suyakuqkunata, ¿yanapanmanchu ñak’ariykunapi qaqata sayasqanku?"
"The pain and anguish that suffering brings are not in themselves things to be desired." "Sut’in kashan, ñak’ariykunapas nanaykunapas manan kusikunapaqchu."
"But when we endure such suffering, good personal qualities can be enhanced and happiness produced." "Ichaqa ñak’ariykunapi qaqata sayasqanchismi sumaq kayninchiskunata yapachin kusikuytapas qowanchis."
"Consider what God’s inspired Word says about this: “Even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy. ”" "Chaypaq qhawarisunchis Diospa Simin Qelqaq nisqanta: “Chaninkaqta ruwasqaykichisraykuchus muchuchisunkichis chayqa, ¡kusisamiyoqmi kankichis! ” nispa."
"“If you are being reproached for the name of Christ, you are happy. ”" "“Cristoraykuchus k’amisqa kankichis chayqa, kusisamiyoqmi kankichis. ”"
"“Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake." "“Kusisamiyoqmi kankichis, ñoqarayku k’amisuqtiykichispas qatiykachasuqtiykichispas, hinallataq tukuy mana allinkunata llullakuspa qankunamanta rimaqtinkupas."
"Rejoice and leap for joy, since your reward is great in the heavens. ”" "Kusikuychis q’ochukuychis, hanaq pachapi premioykichisqa hatunmi. ”"
"“Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life. ” ​ — James 1: 12." "“Kusisamiyoqmi wateqayta muchuq runaqa, chaywan probasqa kaspa mana atipachikuqqa wiñay kawsay coronatan chaskinqa. ”"
"What is it about suffering that makes Jehovah’s worshippers happy?" "¿Imaynapin ñak’ariykuna Jehová Diospa kamachinkunata kusichinman?"
"It is certainly not the actual suffering we may go through that makes us happy." "Ñak’ariyqa manan kusichiwanchischu."
"The happiness, the satisfaction, comes from knowing that we are suffering because we are doing Jehovah’s will and following the pattern of Jesus." "Diospa munayninta ruwaspa Jesusta qatikuspa ñak’arisqanchismi kusichiwanchis."
"For example, in the first century, some of the apostles were jailed and then brought before the Jewish high court and denounced because of preaching about Jesus Christ." "Ñawpaq siglopin wakin apostolkunata carcelpi wisq’aranku, qhepamantaq uma sacerdotekunaman aparanku, hinan paykunata huchacharanku Jesusmanta willasqankurayku."
"They were flogged and then released." "Chaymantataq soq’aspa kacharipuranku."
"What was their attitude?" "¿Imaynan paykuna chaywan sientekuranku?"
"The Bible account says that they “went their way from before the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name. ”" "Biblia khaynata nin: “Apostolkunataq chay huñunakuymanta kusisqa ripurqanku, Jesuspa sutinrayku p’enqayta muchunankupaq akllasqa kasqankurayku ”, nispa."
"They were happy, not for the flogging and the physical pain that ensued, but for the understanding that this had taken place because they kept their integrity to Jehovah and followed in Jesus ’ footsteps. ​ — Acts 16: 25; 2 Corinthians 12: 10; 1 Peter 4: 13." "Paykunataqa manan soq’achikusqankuchu kusichiran. Paykunaqa kusikuranku Jehová Diospaq hunt’aq kasqankurayku Jesusta qatikusqankurayku ñak’arisqankumanta."
"How can our enduring suffering now benefit us in the future?" "Kunan tiempo ñak’ariykunapi qaqata sayasqanchis, ¿imaynata yanapawanchis hamuq tiempopaq?"
"If we endure opposition and persecution with the right attitude, it can build endurance in us. This will help us to weather future sufferings." "Sichus allin yuyaywan qaqata sayashallasun runakuna hark’awaqtinchis qatiykachawaqtinchispas chayqa, preparasqa kasunchis hamuq tiempo ñak’ariykunapipas qaqata sayananchispaq."
"We read: “Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you meet with various trials, knowing as you do that this tested quality of your faith works out endurance. ”" "Biblian niwanchis: “Wawqe - panaykuna, imaymana sasachakuykunapichus rikukunkichis chayqa, anchata kusikuychis, iñiyniykichis probasqa kaqtin aswan pacienciayoq kanaykichista yachaspa ”, nispa."
"Similarly, Romans 5: 3 - 5 informs us: “Let us exult while in tribulations, since we know that tribulation produces endurance; endurance, in turn, an approved condition; the approved condition, in turn, hope, and the hope does not lead to disappointment. ”" "Romanos 5: 3 - 5 textopin chay hinata niwallanchistaq, chaypi nin: “Ñak’ariykunapipas kusikullanchistaqmi."
"So the more we now endure trials because of our Christian course, the better equipped we will be to endure further trials in this wicked system of things." "Yachanchismi ñak’ariykunaqa pacienciakunanchispaq [otaq qaqata sayananchispaq] kallpachawasqanchista. Pacienciakuspan allinpaq hap’isqa kanchis, allinpaq hap’isqa kaytaq suyakuyta yachachiwanchis."
"Jehovah Will Repay" "Suyakuyqa manan p’enqachiwanchischu ”, nispa."
"What will Jehovah do for the future kings and priests that will compensate for their suffering?" "¿Imaynatan Jehová Dios saminchanqa Jesuswan kuska kamachikuqkunata ñak’arisqankumanta?"
"Even when we experience the loss of material things because of opposition or persecution that we suffer for holding to the Christian way, we can be content knowing that Jehovah will reward us fully." "Diospa kamachisqanta kasukusqanchisraykun qatiykachaykunapi kaqninchiskunata chinkachipusunman. Chhaynaña kaqtinpas kusisqallan kashanchis, yachanchismi Jehová Dios aswantaraq saminchawananchista."
"For example, to some who had the hope of going to heaven, the apostle Paul wrote: “You... joyfully took the plundering of your belongings, knowing you yourselves have a better and an abiding possession ” as rulers in God’s Kingdom." "Apóstol Pablo hanaq pachapaq kaq cristianokunaman qelqaran: “Kaqniykichista qechushasuqtiykichispas kusisqallapunin muchurqankichis, hanaq pachapi aswan allin kaqniykichis, mana hayk’aq tukukuq kasqanta yachaspa ”, Diospa Reinonpi kamachikuq kanaykichista yachaspa, nispa."
"And imagine the joy that will be theirs when under the direction of Jehovah and Christ they share in dispensing marvelous blessings to earth’s inhabitants in the new world." "Imayna kusikuyraqmi paykunapaq kanqa mosoq pacha chayamuqtin, chay tiempopin hawisqakunaqa Jehová Diospa nisqanman hina, Cristoq nisqanman hinapiwan, Hallp’api tiyaqkunapaq saminchaykunata mast’arinqaku."
"How true the apostle Paul’s words to faithful Christians: “I reckon that the sufferings of the present season do not amount to anything in comparison with the glory that is going to be revealed in us. ” ​ — Romans 8: 18." "Apóstol Pabloqa chay hinatapuni niran hunt’aq cristianokunaman qelqaspa: “Yachanin, kunan kay ñak’arisqanchiskunaqa manan imapasraqchu qhepa tiempopi Diospa hatunchasqan kananchiswan tupachiqtinchisqa ”, nispa."
"What will Jehovah do for those with the earthly hope who serve him loyally now?" "¿Imatan Jehová Dios ruwanqa hamuq tiempopi kay Hallp’api tiyaqkunapaq?"
"Similarly, no matter what those with the earthly hope may now lose or voluntarily give up because of serving Jehovah, he will reward them superabundantly with what he will do in the future." "Hallp’api wiñay kawsayta suyakuqkunamanpas Jehová Diosqa hamuq tiempopin saminchanqa tukuy imaymana chinkachisqankumanta, payta servispa ima munasqankuta saqesqankumantapas."
"He will give them perfect, endless life on a paradise earth." "Diosqa paraisopin wiñaypaq ch’uya kawsayta paykunaman qonqa."
"In that new world, Jehovah “will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. ”" "Biblia niwanchis chay mosoq pachapiqa Jehová Diosmi “paykunaq ñawinkumanta tukuy weqeta pichanqa, manan wañuypas kanqañachu, manallataqmi llakikuypas, waqaypas, nanaypas kanqañachu ”, nispa."
"What a wonderful promise!" "¡Ima sumaqraqmi chayqa!"
"Nothing we may willingly or unwillingly give up in this present world for Jehovah’s sake can equal the marvelous life to come, which he will give his faithful servants who endure suffering." "Jehová Diosta servisqanchisrayku ima kaqninchiskunatapas chinkachisqanchisqa manan tupanmanchu Jehová Dios ñak’ariypi qaqata sayaqkunaman sumaq kawsay qonanwanqa."
"What comforting promise does Jehovah give us in his Word?" "¿Ima sumaq promesatan Jehová Dios Qelqanpi willawanchis?"
"Any suffering we may yet have to endure will in no way interfere with our enjoyment of everlasting life in God’s new world." "Ima ñak’ariypipas muchusqanchisqa manan hark’awasunchu mosoq pachapi kusisqa kawsananchista."
"All of that will be completely offset by the magnificent conditions in the new world." "Chay mosoq pachapi kawsayqa ancha sumaqpunin kanqa, chaymi ñawpaqpi ñak’arisqanchistapas manaña yuyarisunñachu."
"Isaiah 65: 17, 18 tells us: “The former things will not be called to mind, neither will they come up into the heart." "Isaías 65: 17, 18 texto nin: “Ñawpaq sucedesqankunaqa qonqasqan kapunqa, manañan yuyarisqapasñachu kanqa [...], chayrayku, wiñaypaq kusikuychispas q’ochukuychispas [kamasqaykunapi] ”, nispa."
"But exult, you people, and be joyful forever in what I am creating. ” Consequently, it was appropriate for Jesus ’ half brother James to declare: “We pronounce happy those who have endured. ”" "Chayraykun Jesuspa wayqen Santiagopas kayta qelqaran: “Ñoqanchisqa ñak’arispa pacienciakuqkunataqa [otaq qaqata sayaqkunataqa] kusisamiyoqpaqmi hap’inchis ”, nispa."
"Yes, if we faithfully endure present suffering, we can benefit now and in the future." "Chay hinaqa, sichus qaqata sayashallasunpuni ñak’ariykunapi chayqa, askha saminchaykunatan chaskisun kunan tiempopi hamuq tiempopipas."

"Parents ​ — Train Your Children With Love" "Tayta mamakuna, wawaykichista munakuywan uywaychis"
"“Let all your affairs take place with love. ” ​ — 1 CORINTHIANS 16: 14." "“Tukuy imatapas ruwaspaykichisqa munakuywan ruwaychis. ”"
"What feelings do parents experience at the birth of a child?" "¿Imaynan sientekunku tayta mamakuna wawayoq kaspa?"
"MOST would agree that the birth of a child can be one of life’s most joyful events." "YAQA LLAPA tayta mamakuna anchata kusikunku wawanku naceqtin."
"“When I first gazed at my newborn daughter, it was a wonderful feeling, ” says a mother named Aleah." "Huk mama Aleah sutiyoq nin: “Wachakusqay qhepaman ususiyta qhawaykuspaymi anchata kusikurani."
"“I thought she was the most beautiful child I had ever seen. ”" "Manan hayk’aqpas chhayna sumaq rikch’ayniyoq wawachata rikuranichu ”, nispa."
"Such a joyful occasion, though, can also create anxiety for parents." "Maytaña tayta mamakuna kusikunku chaypas kanmi llakikuykuna."
"“My concern, ” says Aleah’s husband,“ was whether I could properly prepare my daughter for the trials of life. ”" "Aleahq qosanmi ususinta imayna uywananmanta llakikuspa kayta niran: “¿Allintachu ususiyta yanapasaq kawsayninpi sasachakuykunata atipananpaq? ” nispa."
"Many parents share such concerns and realize the need for training their children with love." "Chhaynatan askha tayta mamakuna tapukunku, yachankutaqmi wawankuta munakuywan uywanankutapas."
"However, Christian parents who desire to give such loving training face challenges." "Chaymi cristiano tayta mamakunamanpas sasachakuykunata apamun."
"What are some of them?" "¿Ima sasachakuykunata?"
"What challenges do parents face?" "¿Ima sasachakuykunan kan tayta mamakunapaq?"
"We are now living deep in the last days of this system." "P’uchukay p’unchaykunapin kawsanchis."
"As foretold, a loveless attitude pervades society." "Biblia nisqan hina kay tiempopi runakunaqa manañan munakuyniyoqchu kanku."
"Even among family members, people display “no natural affection ” and have become“ unthankful, disloyal,... without self - control, fierce. ”" "Familia ukhupipas ‘ mana munakuyniyoqkunan ’ kanku, “mana khuyapayakuqkuna ”,“ mana reqsikuqkuna ”, “mana manchakuqkuna ”,“ tukuy allinkaqta cheqnikuqkuna ” ima."
"Daily contact with people who display such traits can affect the way members of Christian families treat one another." "Chay runakuna ukhupi tiyasqanchisraykun paykuna hina familianchistapas tratasunman."
"In addition, parents wrestle with their own inherited tendency to lose self - control, to say things they do not mean, and to use poor judgment in other ways. ​ — Romans 3: 23; James 3: 2, 8, 9." "Hinaspapas tayta mamakuna huchayoq kayninkupi mayninpiqa mana munashaspa k’arakta rimarunku otaq mana allinta yuyaykuspa imatapas ruwanku."
"How can parents raise happy children?" "¿Imaynatan tayta mamakuna wawankuta yanapankuman kusisqa kanankupaq?"
"Despite these challenges, parents can raise happy, spiritually healthy children." "Chhayna sasachakuykunaña kaqtinpas tayta mamakunaqa yanapankumanmi wawankuta kusisqa kawsanankupaq Diosta munakunankupaqpas."
How? ¿Imaynata?
"By following the Bible’s advice: “Let all your affairs take place with love. ”" "Kay yuyaychayta kasukuspa: “Tukuy imatapas ruwaspaykichisqa munakuywan ruwaychis ”."
"Indeed, love is “a perfect bond of union. ”" "Arí, “munakuymi tukuy imatapas sumaqta hukllaman tukuchin ”."
"Let us examine three aspects of love described by the apostle Paul in his first letter to the Corinthians and discuss some specific ways parents can put this quality to work as they train their children. ​ — 1 Corinthians 13: 4 - 8." "Apóstol Pablo Corinto llaqtapi congregacionman ñawpa kaq cartanpi qelqaran imakunapin munakuy rikukunman. Kinsamanta yachasun, qhawarisuntaq imaynatan chaykuna yanapawasunman wawakunata uywanapaq."
"The Need to Be Long - Suffering" "Tayta mamakuna pacienciayoqmi kanaykichis"
"Why do parents need to be long - suffering?" "¿Imarayku tayta mamakuna pacienciayoq kananku?"
"Paul wrote: “Love is long - suffering. ”" "Hukninmanta Pablo kayta qelqaran: “Munakuqqa muchukuqllan ”, nispa (1 Corintios13: 4)."
"The Greek expression translated “long - suffering ” denotes patience and slowness to anger." "“Muchukuqllan ” nisqa simiqa griego rimaymanta t’ikrakun, chaymi tupan pacienciayoq kaywan, mana usqhaylla phiñakuywan ima."
"Why do parents need to be long - suffering?" "¿Imarayku tayta mamakuna pacienciayoq kananku?"
"Most parents can no doubt think of many reasons." "Yachasqanku hina askha razonkunan kan."
"Consider just a few." "Wakinta qhawarisun."
"Children seldom ask just once for some desired object." "Wawakunaqa manan huk kutillachu ima munasqankutapas mañakunku."
"Even if a parent replies with a firm no, the child may ask again and again, hoping for a different answer." "Tayta mamakunaña “manan ” niqtinkupas, mañakushallankun munasqankuta."
"Teenagers may want to argue at length that they should be allowed to take some course of action that the parent knows to be foolish." "Wayna sipas karuspataq munasqankuta ruwanankupaq tayta mamankuta imaymanawan q’otunku (Proverbios 22: 15)."
"And like all of us, children are prone to repeat some of their mistakes. ​ — Psalm 130: 3." "Llapa runakuna hinan wayna sipaskunapas pantashallanku (Salmo 130: 3)."
"What can help parents to be long - suffering?" "¿Iman tayta mamakunata yanapanqa pacienciayoq kanankupaq?"
"What can help parents to be long - suffering and patient with their children?" "¿Iman tayta mamakunata yanapanqa pacienciayoq kanankupaq?"
"King Solomon wrote: “The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger. ”" "Kamachikuq Salomonpa nisqanta yuyarinanku: “Runaq allin yuyayniyoq - kayninqa phiñakuytan hark’an ” (Proverbios 19: 11)."
"Parents gain insight into their children’s behavior by recalling that at one time they too used to “speak as a babe, to think as a babe, to reason as a babe. ”" "Allin yuyayniyoq taytapas mamapas wawanta entiendenanpaqqa yuyarinanmi paypas ‘ huch’uyllaraq kashaspa wawa hina rimasqanta, yuyaykusqanta, unanchasqantapas ’."
"Parents, can you remember bothering your mother or father to give in to a childish request?" "Qankunari tayta mamakuna, ¿imaynan karankichis wayna sipas kashaspa?"
"As a teenager, did you ever think that your parents just did not understand your feelings or problems?" "Wayna sipas kashaspayki, ¿manachu kay hinata yuyaykuranki, tayta mamayqa mana entiendenchu imayna sientekusqayta ima sasachakuykunapi tarikusqaytapas, nispa?"
"If so, you likely appreciate why your children behave as they do and why they need constant, patient reminders of your decisions." "Chaykunata yuyarispan aswan allinta wawaykikunata entiendenki imarayku chhayna kasqankuta, imarayku necesitanku familiapaq kamachikuykunata pacienciawan yuyarichinaykitapas."
"It is worth noting that Jehovah told Israelite parents to “inculcate ” his laws in their young ones." "Jehová Diosmi kamachiran wawankuman ‘ yachachinankupaq ’ (Deuteronomio 6: 6, 7)."
"The Hebrew word for “inculcate ” means“ to repeat, ” “to say again and again, ”“ to impress. ”" "Hebreo rimaypi “yachachiy ” nisqa simiqa kay ninanmi,“ yuyayninpi takyachiy ”, “rimapayashallay ”."
"This implies that parents may have to repeat themselves many times before a child learns to apply God’s laws." "Chaymi tayta mamakunaqa wawankuta rimapayashanallanku Diospa kamachikuyninta kasukunankupaq."
"Similar repetition is often needed to teach other lessons in life." "Tukuy ruwasqankupipas yuyarichishanallankun allin kanankupaq."
"Why is a long - suffering parent not a permissive one?" "Pacienciayoqña tayta mamakuna kananku chaypas, ¿imarayku mana hinallatachu qhawananku wawankuq tukuy ima ruwasqantapas?"
"A long - suffering parent, however, is not a permissive parent." "Tayta mamakuna wawankupaq pacienciayoqña kananku chaypas manan chayraykuchu hinallata qhawananku ima ruwasqankutapas."
"God’s Word warns: “A boy let on the loose will be causing his mother shame. ”" "Proverbios qelqa kayta anyan: “Ima munasqanta ruwananpaq hinallata qhawasqa wawan [...] mamanta p’enqachin ”."
"To prevent such an outcome, the same proverb states: “The rod and reproof are what give wisdom. ”" "Kikin qelqan nillantaq: “Wanaykachiyqa anyaykuyqa wawatan yachachin ”, nispa (Proverbios 29: 15)."
"At times, children may question the right of parents to reprove them." "Mayninpiqa manan wawakuna wanachisqa kayta munanqakuchu."
"But Christian families should not be run as a democracy, as if the parents ’ right to enforce rules were somehow dependent on the children’s approval." "Ichaqa cristiana familiapiqa manan pipas munaynillantaqa ruwanmanchu, chayraykun tayta mamakunaqa mana wawankutaraqchu tapunanku imayna kamachikunankutapas."
"Rather, Jehovah, as the ultimate Head of the family, confers on parents the authority to train and discipline their children lovingly." "Jehová Diosmi llapa familiakunaq Uman, paymi tayta mamakunata kamachin wawankuta yachachinankupaq munakuywan wanachinankupaqpas."
"In fact, discipline is closely linked with the next aspect of love mentioned by Paul." "Munakuymanta Pabloq rimasqanmi tupallantaq wanachiywan."
"How to Discipline in Love" "Imaynata munakuywan wanachina"
"Why will kind parents discipline their children, and what is included in such discipline?" "¿Imapaqmi munakuq tayta mamakuna wawankuta wanachinanku, imataq wanachiyri?"
"Paul wrote that “love is... kind. ”" "Apóstol Pablo munakuymanta kayta nillantaq: “Pipas munakuqqa [...] sumaq sonqollan ”, nispa."
"Parents who are truly kind will discipline their children in a consistent manner." "Munakuq tayta mamakunaqa allin yuyaywan, sumaq sonqowanmi wawankuta wanachinanku."
"By doing so, they imitate Jehovah. “Whom Jehovah loves he disciplines, ” wrote Paul." "Chayta ruwaspan Jehová Diosta qatikunqaku, payqa apóstol Pabloq nisqan hina “pitachus munakun chaytan wanachin ”."
"Please note that the type of discipline referred to in the Bible does not simply mean punishment. It carries the idea of training and education." "Wanachiyqa manan soq’ayllachu nitaq maqayllachu, aswanmi allinta uywaspa allin kananpaq yachachiy."
"What is the purpose of such discipline?" "¿Imapaqmi wanachina?"
"“To those who have been trained by it, ” Paul states,“ it yields peaceable fruit, namely, righteousness. ”" "Apóstol Pablo kutichin: “Wanachisqawan yachaqaspa chaninta, sumaqta purinchis ”, nispa."
"When parents kindly educate their children according to God’s will, they give them the opportunity to become peaceable, upright adults." "Chhaynaqa, ¿imapaqmi tayta mamakuna munakuywan Diospa kamachikuyninman hina wawankuta yachachinanku? Wawanku wiñaspa thakpi kawsanankupaq chanin runa kanankupaqwan."
"If children accept “the discipline of Jehovah, ” they gain wisdom, knowledge, and discernment ​ — assets more valuable than silver or gold. ​ — Proverbs 3: 11 - 18." "‘ Señor Diospa wanachiyninta ’ chaskikuq wawakunaqa allin yachayniyoqmi allin reparakuqtaqmi kanqaku, chayqa qorimanta qolqemantapas aswan chaniyoqmi (Proverbios 3: 11 - 18)."
"What usually results when parents fail to discipline their children?" "¿Imaynan kanku mana wanachisqa wawakuna?"
"On the other hand, it is not a kindness when parents fail to discipline their children." "Munakuq tayta mamakunaqa wanachinankupunin wawankuta."
"Jehovah inspired Solomon to write: “The one holding back his rod is hating his son, but the one loving him is he that does look for him with discipline. ”" "Jehová Diosmi Salomonta yuyaycharan kayta qelqananpaq: “Wawanta mana wanachiqqa wawantan cheqnikun, wawanta munakuqmi ichaqa sumaqta wanachin ” (Proverbios 13: 24)."
"Children raised without consistent discipline are likely to be self - centered and unhappy." "Estudiokuna ruwakusqanpi ninku, mana wanachisqa wawakunaqa paykunallapaq munaq kanku manataqmi kusisqachu kankupas."
"In contrast, the children of parents who are sympathetic but maintain firm limits were found to perform better at school, to have better social skills, and to be generally happy." "Ichaqa munakuywan wanachisqa wawakunan escuelankupi allinta yachanku hukkunawanpas allinpi kawsanku kusisqataq kankupas, nispa."
"Certainly, then, parents who discipline their children are being kind to them." "Arí, chaypi rikusqanchis hina munakuq tayta mamakunaqa wawankutan wanachinku."
"What do Christian parents teach their children, and how should these requirements be viewed?" "¿Imatan tayta mamakuna wawankuman yachachinanku, imatan sut’inchanallankutaq?"
"What is involved in disciplining children in a kind and loving manner?" "¿Imatan cristiano tayta mamakuna ruwananku wawankuta munakuywan sumaq sonqowan wanachinankupaq?"
"Parents need to discuss with their children exactly what is required of them." "Sut’itan yachachinanku ima kamachikuykuna hunt’anankuta."
"For example, from infancy, children of Christian parents are taught fundamental Bible principles as well as the need to participate in the various aspects of true worship." "Qholla wawa kasqankumantapachan yachachinanku Bibliapi qallariy yachachikuykunata, Jehová Dios yupaychanapaq huk ruwaykunamantawan (Éxodo 20: 12 - 17; Mateo 22: 37 - 40; 28: 19; Hebreos 10: 24, 25)."
"Children need to know that these requirements are nonnegotiable." "Sut’itan yachachinaykichis cristianokunapaq kamachikuykuna mana rimapakuspalla kasukuna kasqanta."
"10, 11." "10, 11."
"Why might parents consider their children’s concerns when making house rules?" "¿Imarayku mayninpiqa wawakunaq necesitasqanman hina familiapaq kamachikuykunata churakunman?"
"At times, though, parents may want to bring their children into the discussion when formulating house rules." "Mayninpiqa tayta mamakunan wawankuwan rimanakunku wasipi ima kamachikuykuna kasukuna kasqanta."
"If youths are able to share in discussions about those rules, they may be more inclined to obey them." "Chaymi astawan wayna sipaskunata yanapanman kasukunankupaq."
"For instance, in case parents decide to impose a curfew, they could choose a specific hour that the children are required to be at home." "Ejemplopaq, tayta mamakunan ninkuman wawanku ima horata wasiman kutipunankuta."
"Or, as an alternative, they might allow their children to suggest an hour and to offer reasons for their preference." "Otaq wayna sipaskuna ñawpaqta willankuman ima horata wasiman kutipuyta munanku imarayku chay horata akllakusqankutapas."
"The parents may then state their own desired time and explain why they feel that this is appropriate." "Tayta mamakunapas ninkumanmi ima horata munanku wawanku kutipunanta, paykunapas willananku imarayku chay horata akllanku."
"If there is a difference of opinion, as there will likely be, what then?" "Ichaqa, ¿tayta mamaq akllasqan hora, wawankuq akllasqan horawan mana tupaqtinri?"
"In some cases, the parents may decide that it might be possible to accommodate their children’s wishes when Bible principles are not jeopardized." "Mayninpiqa wawaykichispa akllakusqanman hinan ruwawaqchis ichaqa Diospa kamachikuyninta ama p’akispa."
"Does this mean that the parents are abdicating, or giving up, their authority?" "¿Chay hina ruway mana kasuchikuychu kanman?"
"To answer that question, consider the way in which Jehovah lovingly exercised his authority when dealing with Lot and his family." "Chay tapuyta kutichinapaq yuyarisun imaynatan Jehová Dios Lotta, warminta, ususinkunatawan munakuywan kamachiran."
"After escorting Lot, his wife, and his daughters out of Sodom, the angels said to them: “Escape to the mountainous region for fear you may be swept away! ”" "Angelkunan paykunata Sodoma llaqta hawaman horqomuspa Lotta niranku: “¡Orqo - orqoman ayqey, paqtan wañuwaq! ” nispa."
"However, Lot replied: “Not that, please, Jehovah! ”" "Lottaq kutichiran: “¡Manan!, valekuykichismi wiraqochaykuna ”, nispa."
"Lot then suggested an alternative: “Please, now, this city is nearby to flee there and it is a small thing." "Mañakurantaq: “Qhawariy haqay llaqtata qayllallaypin kashan, chayman ayqesaq, chayqa huch’uyllan."
"May I, please, escape there? ”" "Haqayman ayqechiwaychis kawsanaypaq ”, nispa."
"What was Jehovah’s response?" "¿Uyariranchu Jehová Dios mañakusqanta?"
"“Here I do show you consideration to this extent also, ” he said." "Diosmi niran: “Kay mañakusqaykitapas uyarinin ”, nispa (Génesis 19: 17 - 22)."
"Did Jehovah abdicate his authority?" "¿Manachu chay karan mana kasuchikuy hina?"
"Certainly not!" ¡Manan!
"Nevertheless, he considered Lot’s request and chose to extend extra kindness to him in this matter." "Aswanmi Lotta anchata khuyapayaspa mañakusqanta uyariran."
"If you are a parent, are there times when you can consider your children’s concerns when establishing family rules?" "Tayta mamakuna, familia ukhupi ima kamachikuytapas churaspa, ¿reparankichischu imakunatan necesitan wawaykichiskuna?"
"What will help a child to feel secure?" "¿Iman yanapanqa wawakunata mana iskayanankupaq?"
"Of course, children need to know not only the rules but also the penalties for breaking those rules." "Wawakunaqa yachanankun tayta mamankuq kamachikuyninta mana kasukuqtinku wanachisqa kanankuta."
"Once the penalties have been discussed and are understood, the rules need to be enforced." "Chayta entiendeqtinkutaq tayta mamakunaqa kamachikusqankuta kasuchikunanku."
"Parents are not being kind if they constantly warn their children about a deserved punishment but fail to carry it out." "Wanachisaykin nispa yanqalla manchachinkuman chayqa manan wawakunaq allinninpaqchu kanman."
"“Because sentence against a bad work has not been executed speedily, that is why the heart of the sons of men has become fully set in them to do bad, ” says the Bible." "“Mana chanin ruwasqamanta mana usqhaylla huchachay kaqtinmi, runakunaq sonqonqa aswantaraq millay kaqkunata ruwayta munan. ” (Eclesiastés 8: 11.)"
"True, a parent may refrain from punishing a child in public or around the child’s peers, thus saving the young one some embarrassment." "Munakuq taytakunaqa wawankuta mana p’enqachiyta munaspa manapaschá runakunaq otaq amigonkunaq ñawpaqenpichu wanachinqa."
"But children feel more secure and develop more respect and love for their parents when they know that their parents ’ “Yes ” means yes and their“ No ” means no ​ — even if that entails punishment. ​ — Matthew 5: 37." "Chaywanpas hunt’anankun “arí ” nisqankuwan“ manan ” nisqankuwanpas, wanachisaykin niqtinkupas wanachinanku, chaypin wawakuna yachanqaku hunt’aq kasqankuta. Chayta yachaspaqa manan iskayanqakuchu, tayta mamankutapas respetanqaku munakunqakutaqmi."
"13, 14." "13, 14."
"How can parents imitate Jehovah when training their children?" "¿Imaynatan tayta mamakuna Jehová Dios hina wawankuta wanachinkuman?"
"If it is to be kind, the punishment and the way it is administered need to be tailored to the child." "Hinaspapas munakuq tayta mamakunaqa yachanqakun sapanka wawankuta imayna wanachiyta."
"“Our two children had different needs when it came to discipline, ” recalls Pam." "Huk mama Pam sutiyoq yuyarin imayna karan iskaynin ususinkuna, paymi nin: “Sapanka ususiymi necesitaran hukniray wanachinata."
"“What worked with one child didn’t work for the other. ”" "Hukninpaqmi huk wanachiy allin karan hukninpaqtaq mana ”, nispa."
"Her husband, Larry, explains: “Our elder daughter was strong - willed and seemed to respond only to stern discipline." "Larry sutiyoq qosanmi kayta nillantaq: “Kurakkaqmi sasata kasukuq, allin kallpawan kamachillaqtiykun yaqapas uyarikuq."
"However, our younger daughter was very responsive to firm words and even a disapproving look. ”" "Sullk’akaqmi ichaqa kallpawan kamachiqtiyku kasukuqpacha ”, nispa."
"Indeed, kind parents strive to discern what discipline works best for each of their children." "Arí, munakuq tayta mamakunaqa allintan qhawarinanku imaynatan sapanka wawankuta wanachinqaku."
"Jehovah sets the pattern for parents in that he knows the strengths and weaknesses of each of his servants." "Jehová Diosmi allin ejemplo tayta mamakunapaq, payqa reqsiwanchismi, yachanmi sapankanchis imayna kasqanchistapas."
"In addition, when meting out punishment, Jehovah is neither unduly stern nor overly permissive." "Llaqtanta wanachinan kaqtinqa mana millaytachu wanachin nitaq hinallatachu qhawan ima ruwasqankutapas."
"Instead, he always disciplines his people “to the proper degree. ”" "Aswanmi ‘ wananankukamalla ’ wanachin (Jeremías 30: 11)."
"Parents, do you know your children’s strengths and weaknesses? Are you able to use that knowledge in a positive, kind way to train them?" "Tayta mamakuna, ¿reqsinkichischu wawaykichispa allin kayninta mana allin kaynintapas, chayman hinataqchu munakuywan wanachishankichis?"
"If so, you are proving that you love your children." "Chayta ruwashankichis chayqa ancha munakusqaykichistan rikuchishankichis."
"Encourage Honest Communication" "Sut’illanta rimaq kanankupaq yanapay"
"15, 16." "15, 16."
"How can parents encourage their children to speak honestly, and what approach have Christian parents found effective in this regard?" "¿Imatan tayta mamakuna ruwankuman wawanku sut’illanta rimaq kanankupaq, chaypaq imatan wakin tayta mamakuna ruwaranku?"
"Another facet of love is that “it does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. ”" "Kaypin munakuy rikukullantaq, “manan mana chanin kaqmantachu kusikun, aswanpas cheqaqkaqmantan kusikun ”."
"How can parents train their children to love what is right and true?" "¿Imaynatan tayta mamakuna wawankuta yachachinkuman chaninkaqta cheqaqkaqtapas munakunankupaq?"
"A fundamental step is to encourage their children to express their feelings honestly, even if what the children say is difficult for the parents to accept." "Chaypaqqa, chanintaña mana chanintaña rimaqtinpas kallpachanaykin sut’illanta rimananpaq."
"Understandably, parents rejoice when children express thoughts and feelings in harmony with righteous standards." "Tayta mamakunaqa kusikunqakuchá wawanku Diospa kamachikusqanman hina chaninta rimaqtinku yuyaykuqtinkupas."
"At other times, though, a child’s heartfelt comments may reveal an inclination toward unrighteousness." "Mayninpitaq ichaqa rimasqankupi reparakunqa mana chanin yuyaykuna sonqonkupi saphichakusqanta (Génesis 8: 21)."
"How should parents respond?" "Chhayna kaqtin, ¿imatan tayta mamakuna ruwankuman?"
"Their initial tendency might be to chastise their children immediately for expressing such thoughts." "Yaqapaschá phiñakuspa soq’ayta munankuman."
"If parents respond in such a way, the children might soon learn to say only what they think the parents want to hear." "Chayta ruwanqaku chayqa tayta mamanpa uyariy munasqallantan wawakuna rimanqaku."
"Of course, disrespectful speech should be promptly corrected, but there is a difference between teaching children how to communicate politely and dictating what they say." "Mana respetowan rimaqtinkuqa usqhayllan wanachinanku, ichaqa respetowan rimanankupaqqa yachachinankun, manan tanqanankuchu tayta mamanpa munasqallanta rimanankupaq."
"How can parents encourage honest communication?" "¿Imatan tayta mamakuna ruwankuman familiapi sut’i rimay kananpaq?"
"Aleah, mentioned earlier, says, “We have created an atmosphere of open communication by trying not to overreact when our children tell us things that we find troubling. ”" "Aleah nin: “Familiaykupin kallpachakuyku sut’i rimay kananpaq. Chhayna kananpaqqa wawayku imataña willawaqtinkupas manan phiñakuykupachachu ”, nispa."
"A father named Tom says: “We encouraged our daughter to express herself to us, even when she didn’t agree with our way of thinking." "Huk tayta Tom sutiyoq nillantaq: “Ususiykutan kallpachayku imatapas sut’illanta willawanankupaq mana munasqaykuman hinaña kaqtinpas."
"We felt that if we always cut her off and arbitrarily imposed our will, she would become frustrated and would learn not to tell us what was really in her heart." "Sichus sapa kutilla imata willawashaqtinkupas upallachisaqku otaq munasqaykuman hina rimananta munasaqku chayqa yaqapaschá mana sut’itachu imatapas willawankuman."
"On the other hand, listening to her encouraged her to listen to us. ”" "Payta uyarisaqku chayqa ñoqaykutapas uyariwanqakun ”, nispa."
"Certainly, children should obey their parents." "Wawakunaqa kasukunankun tayta mamankuta (Proverbios 6: 20)."
"But open communication gives parents the opportunity to help their children develop reasoning ability." "Paykunallamanta allin yuyaykukuq kanankupaqmi ichaqa familia ukhupi allin rimanakuy kanan."
"Vincent, a father of four, says: “Often, we would talk through the advantages and disadvantages of a situation so that our children could see for themselves the best outcome." "Tawa ususiyoq Vincent sutiyoq tayta nin: “Imata decidenayku kaqtinpas ñawpaqtan qhawariyku allinchus kanman icha mana allinchus chayta, chayman hinataqmi ususiykuna yuyaymanaspa akllakunku mayqenmi aswan allin kanman chayta."
"This helped them develop thinking ability. ” ​ — Proverbs 1: 1 - 4." "Ahinapin allin yuyayta hap’iranku ”, nispa (Proverbios 1: 1 - 4)."
"Of what can parents be sure?" "¿Imatan tayta mamakuna chaskinkuman?"
"Of course, no parent will be able to apply perfectly the Bible’s counsel on child rearing." "Wawakunata Bibliaq nisqanman hinapuni uywayqa sasan."
"Even so, you can be sure that your children will deeply appreciate your attempts to train them in a long - suffering, kind, and loving manner." "Chaywanpas, sichus qankuna tayta mamakuna wawaykichista uywankichis pacienciawan, munakuywan, sumaq sonqowan ima chayqa anchatan wawakuna agradecekusunkichis."
"Jehovah will certainly bless your efforts to do so." "Jehová Diospas saminchasunkichismi ancha kallpachakusqaykichismanta (Proverbios 3: 33)."
"Ultimately, all Christian parents want their children to learn to love Jehovah as much as they themselves do." "Ichaqa llapa cristiano tayta mamakunan munanku paykuna hina wawanku Jehová Dios munakunankuta."
"How can parents reach this noble goal?" "Chhayna kananpaq, ¿imata ruwananku?"
"The following article will discuss some specific methods." "Qatimuq estudiopin yachasun imaynatan chayta ruwankuman."
"Do You Recall?" ¿Yuyarishankichu?

"Teach Your Children to Love Jehovah" "Wawaykikunata yachachiy Jehová Diosta munakunankupaq"
"“Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of youth. ” ​ — PSALM 127: 4." "“Awqa - tinkuqpa hap’isqan wach’ikuna [flechakuna] hinan wayna kashaqtin naceq wawakunaqa. ” (SALMO 127: 4.)"
"1, 2." "1, 2."
"How are children like “arrows in the hand of a mighty man ”?" "¿Imaynapin wawakuna tupan ‘ awqa - tinkuqpa hap’isqan wach’ikunawan ’?"
"AN ARCHER prepares to shoot an arrow at a target." "HUK WACH’IQ allichakun wach’inanpaq."
"He carefully places it against the bowstring, and with flexed muscles he bends his bow." "Wach’ita sumaqllata p’eqtaman [arcoman] churan hinaspa allinta chutan."
"Despite the strain, he takes time to aim the arrow. Then he lets it fly!" "Allillamanta maychus chayananman apuntan chaymantataq wach’ita kacharin."
"Will the arrow hit the target?" "¿Munasqanmanchu wach’i chayanqa?"
"Several factors determine the answer, including the skill of the archer, the effect of the wind, and the condition of the arrow." "Munasqanman chayananpaqqa wach’iqmi allin wakichisqa kanan, wayrapas chayman hina wayranan, wach’ipas allin kanan."
"King Solomon likened children to “arrows in the hand of a mighty man. ”" "Kamachiq Salomonmi wawakunata tupachiran ‘ awqa - tinkuqpa hap’isqan wach’ikunawan ’ (Salmo 127: 4)."
"Consider how this illustration might be applied." "Qhawarisun imaynatan chay rikch’anachiy tupan tayta mamakunawan."
"An archer has the arrow in his bow for only a relatively short time." "Wach’iqpaqqa pisi tiempollan kan apuntananpaq, usqhayllataqmi wach’ita kacharinan maychus munasqanman chayananpaq."
"To hit the target, he must quickly let it go." "Tayta mamakunapaqpas pisi tiempollan kan Jehová Dios munakuyta wawankuman yachachinankupaq."
"Likewise, parents have only a relatively short period of time to develop in their children heartfelt love for Jehovah." "Wawakunaqa usqhayllata wiñaruspan wasimanta pasapunku."
"After what seems to be just a few short years, the children grow up and leave home." "¿Tayta mamaq munasqanmanchu “wach’ikuna ” chayanqa?"
"Will they hit the target ​ — that is, will the children continue to love and serve God after they leave home?" "Huk rimaypi nisunman, ¿wasimanta pasapuspa munakushallanqakuchu Jehová Diosta, munaynintapas ruwashallanqakuchu?"
"Numerous factors influence the answer." "Chhayna kananpaqqa askha ruwaykuna necesitakun."
"Three of them are the skill of the parent, the environment in which the children are raised, and the way the ‘ arrow, ’ or child, responds to the training he or she receives." "T’aqwirisun kinsa ruwaykunamanta: tayta mamaq ruwananmanta, familia ukhupi imayna kawsanamanta, wayna sipaskuna yachasqankuman hina akllakunankumantawan."
"First, we will consider some of the traits of a skillful parent." "Ñawpaqta qhawarisun imatan tayta mamakuna ruwananku."
"Skillful Parents Set a Good Example" "Allin kawsayniykichiswan yachachiychis"
"Why must a parent’s words be backed up by actions?" "¿Imarayku tayta mamakuna ruwayninkuwan wawankuta yachachinanku?"
"Jesus set the example for parents in that he practiced what he preached." "Jesusqa yachachisqanman hinan imatapas ruwaq, chaymi payqa llapa tayta mamakunapaq allin ejemplo."
"On the other hand, he condemned the Pharisees, who would “say ” but“ not perform. ”" "Fariseokunan ichaqa mana yachachisqankuman hinachu imatapas ruwaqku chaymi Jesús paykunata huchacharan."
"In order to motivate their children to love Jehovah, the parents ’ words and actions must work together." "Tayta mamakunaqa ruwayninkuwanmi wawankuta yachachinanku Jehová Diosta munakunankupaq."
"Words that are not backed up by actions are just as ineffective as a bow without a bowstring. ​ — 1 John 3: 18." "Sichus tayta mamakuna mana rimasqankuman hinachu imatapas ruwanqaku chayqa yanqapaqmi rimasqanku kanqa mana watuyoq p’eqta hina."
"What questions do parents do well to ask themselves, and why?" "¿Imakunatan tayta mamakuna tapukunanku, imaraykutaq chaykunata tapukunanku?"
"Why is parental example so important?" "Tayta mamakunaqa allin ejemplon kananku."
"Just as adults can learn to love God by looking at Jesus ’ example, children can learn to love Jehovah by following their parents ’ good example." "Jesusta qhawarispa. Chhaynatan wawakunapas tayta mamanta qhawarispa Jehová Diosta munakunqaku."
"A child’s associates can either strengthen the child or “spoil useful habits. ”" "Wawakunaqa pikunawan huñunakusqankumantan imatapas yachanqaku: paykunan wawata yanapankuman otaq ‘ samaykunkuman [waqllichinkuman] ’."
"For much of a child’s life, and certainly during the important formative years, the closest, most influential associates a child has are his parents." "Wawakunaqa nacesqankumantapacha tayta mamankuwan kanku otaq huñukunku, paykunan kanku wawankuq amigon, paykunamantan wawakunaqa astawan imatapas yachanku."
"Therefore, parents do well to ask themselves: ‘ What sort of associate am I?" "Chayrayku tayta mamakuna tapukunanku: “¿Allin amigochu kani wawaypaq?"
"Does my example encourage my child to develop useful habits?" "¿Allin ruwaykunatachu yachachishani kawsayniywan?"
"What example am I setting in the vital areas of prayer and Bible study? ’" "¿Allintachu qhawarichikushani Diosmanta mañakuypi Biblia estudiaypipas?"
"Skillful Parents Pray With Their Children" "Wawaykichiswan kuska mañakuychis"
"What can children learn from a parent’s prayers?" "¿Imatan wawakuna yachankuman tayta mamanpa mañakusqanmanta?"
"Your children can learn much about Jehovah by listening to your prayers." "Tayta mamakunaq mañakusqanta uyarispan wawakunaqa Jehová Diosmanta astawan yachanqaku."
"If they hear you give thanks to God at mealtimes and offer prayers at Bible study sessions, what conclusions might they draw?" "Yachanapaq: ¿imatan wawakuna yachanqaku, Biblia estudiayta qallarinankupaq mikhuyta qallarinankupaqpas tayta mamanku Diosmanta mañakuqtinku?"
"They will likely learn that Jehovah supplies our physical needs ​ — for which he should be thanked — ​ and that he teaches us spiritual truths." "Paykunaqa yachanqakuchá lliw mikhuytapas espiritual mikhunatapas Jehová Dios qowasqanchista, chaykunamanta agradecekunanchistapas."
"These are valuable lessons. ​ — James 1: 17." "Ancha chaniyoqmi chaykunamanta yachachiyqa."
"How can parents help children to feel that Jehovah is interested in them as individuals?" "¿Imaynatan tayta mamakuna wawankuta yachachinkuman Jehová Dios paykunata ancha munakusqanta?"
"However, if you pray with your family at times other than meals and family Bible studies and if you discuss specific matters that affect you and your children, you will accomplish even more." "Chaymantapas tayta mamakunaqa astawanmi yanapankuman sapanka wawankuq necesitasqanman hina mañakuspa."
"You will help your children to feel that Jehovah is part of your family, that he cares deeply about you individually." "Chhaynapin wawankuta yachachinqaku Jehová Dios familianku hina kasqanta, sapankankuta munakusqantapas."
"One father says: “From the time our daughter was born, we prayed with her." "Huk tayta nin: “Ususiykuwan kuskan mañakurayku nacesqanmantapacha."
"As she grew older, we prayed about relationship issues and other matters that affected her." "Wiñasqanman hinataq imachus necesitasqanmanta pikunawan huñukunanmantawan mañakurayku."
"Until she left home to marry, not a day went by that we did not pray together with her. ”" "Mañakushallaraykun casarakuspa wasimanta ripunankamapas ”, nispa."
"Could you also pray with your children each day?" "Tayta mamakuna, ¿sapa p’unchaychu wawaykichiswan mañakushankichis?"
"Could you help them view Jehovah as a Friend, who not only provides their physical and spiritual necessities but also cares about their emotional needs? ​ — Philippians 4: 6, 7." "¿Yanapawaqchischu wawaykichista Jehová Diosta amigonkuta hina rikunankupaq imaymana qoqninkuta hina rikunankupaqpas?"
"To make their prayers specific, what do parents need to know?" "¿Imatan ñawpaqta tayta mamakuna sapanka wawankumanta yachananku chayman hina mañakunankupaq?"
"Of course, for you to make your prayers specific, you need to know what is happening in your child’s life." "Ñawpaqtan yachananku wawakunawan ima sucedesqanta chayman hinataq mañakunanku."
"Note the comments of one father who raised two children: “At the end of each week, I asked myself two questions: ‘ What things were of concern to my children this week?" "Qhawarisun imatan ruwaran iskay ususiyoq tayta: “Sapa semana tukuytan kaykunata tapukurani: ‘ ¿Ima llakikuykunan karan kay semanapi ususiykunapaq?"
"And what good things happened in their world? ’ ”" "¿Ima kusikuykunan karan? ’ ” nispa."
"Parents, can you ask yourselves such questions and then incorporate some of the answers into the prayers you say with your children?" "Tayta mamakuna, ¿manachu qankunapas chay tapuykunata tapurikuwaqchis? Chaykunamanta yachaspaqa chayman hinan wawaykichiswan mañakuwaqchis."
"If you do, you will be teaching them not only to pray to Jehovah ​ — the Hearer of prayer — ​ but also to love him. ​ — Psalm 65: 2." "Chayta ruwaspaqa manan Jehová Dioswan rimayllatachu yachachinkichis aswanpas — mañakusqata Uyariq — Dios munakuytan yachachinkichis (Salmo 65: 2)."
"Skillful Parents Encourage Good Study Habits" "Yachachiychis allin estudiaq kanankupaq"
"Why must parents help their children to acquire the habit of studying God’s Word?" "¿Imarayku tayta mamakuna yanapananku wawankuta sapa p’unchay Bibliata estudianankupaq?"
"How can a parent’s attitude toward Bible study influence a child’s relationship with God?" "Jehová Dioswan wawakuna allinpi kanankupaqqa tayta mamakunan allin estudiaq kananku."
"For any relationship to grow and survive, the individuals involved must not only talk to each other but also listen." "Jehová Dioswan runakunawanpas allinpi kananchispaqqa manan ñoqallanchischu rimananchis paykunatapas uyarinanchismi."
"One of the ways we listen to Jehovah is by studying the Bible with the aid of publications supplied by ‘ the faithful slave. ’" "Diosta uyarinapaqqa Bibliatan estudiananchis “hunt’aq kamachi ” apachimuwasqanchis qelqakunawan yanapachikuspa."
"Therefore, to help their children develop a lasting, loving relationship with Jehovah, parents do well to encourage them to develop the habit of studying God’s Word." "Chaymi wawakuna Jehová Dioswan allinpi kanankupaqqa yanapanayki sapa p’unchay Bibliata estudianankupaq."

"Again, a parent’s example teaches best." "Tayta mamakunan astawanqa qhawarichikunanku allin estudiaq kasqankuta."
"Do your children regularly see you enjoying personal Bible reading or study?" "Tayta mamakuna, ¿rikushasunkichischu wawaykichis mana saqespa Biblia estudiasqaykichista?"
"True, you are likely very busy caring for your children, and you may wonder when you can find time to read and study." "Yaqapaschá wawaykikunata uywanaykipaq llank’asqaykirayku mana tiempo aypasunkichu Bibliata estudianaykipaq."
"But ask yourself, ‘ Do my children regularly see me watching television? ’" "Ichaqa tapukuy: “¿Rikushanchu wawaykuna televisionta qhawaspa unay tiempo usuchisqayta? ”."
"If so, could you use some of that time to set a good example for them regarding personal study?" "Chhayna kaqtin, ¿manachu aswanpas chay tiempota t’aqaspa Bibliata estudiawaq chhaynapi wawaykikunawan allinta qhawarichikunaykipaq?"
"10, 11." "10, 11."
"Why should parents have regular family Bible discussions?" "¿Imaraykun kananpuni sapa semana familia ukhupi Biblia estudiay?"
"Another practical way parents can teach children to listen to Jehovah is by having regular family Bible discussions." "Hinaspapas wawaykikuna Jehová Diosta uyarinankupaqqa familiantinmi sapa semana Bibliata estudianaykichis (Isaías 30: 21)."
"Some may wonder, though, ‘ Why do children need a family study if their parents regularly take them to congregation meetings? ’" "Wakinqa ninkumanpaschá, sapa huñunakuymantaq wawayku rishan chayqa imapaqñataq wasipi yachachiykuman, nispa."
"There are several good reasons." "Ichaqa kananpunin familia ukhupi estudioqa."
"Jehovah entrusts parents with the primary responsibility to teach their children." "Jehová Diosmi tayta mamakunata kamachin wawankuman yachachinankupaq (Proverbios 1: 8; Efesios 6: 4)."
"Family Bible study teaches children that worship is, not a formal ritual observed only in public, but part of the family’s private life. ​ — Deuteronomy 6: 6 - 9." "Familiapi estudiasqankun wawakunata qhawarichinqa runakuna ukhupipas familia ukhupipas Dios yupaychanankuta (Deuteronomio 6: 6 - 9)."
"In addition, a well - conducted family study can provide parents with a window into their children’s thinking on spiritual and moral matters." "Familiapi estudiota allinta apariqtinkun tayta mamakuna yachanqaku imatan wawanku yuyaykun iñiymanta imayna kawsanamantapas."
"For instance, when children are young, parents can use such publications as Learn From the Great Teacher." "Wawakuna huch’uyllaraq kaqtinqa Aprendamos del Gran Maestro nisqa librowanmi yachachinkuman."
"* In almost every paragraph of this Bible study aid, children are asked to express their opinion on the subjects discussed." "* Yaqa llapa parrafokunapin tapuykuna kashan erqechakuna yuyaykusqankuman hina kutichinanpaq."
"By reasoning on the scriptures mentioned in the book, parents may be able to help children to develop their perceptive powers “to distinguish both right and wrong. ” ​ — Hebrews 5: 14." "Sichus tayta mamakuna libropi kaq textoman hina erqechakunata yuyaymanachinqaku chayqa “allinkaqta mana allinkaqta reparayta ” yachachinqaku."
"How might parents adapt the family study to a child’s needs, and what have you found to be effective in this regard?" "¿Imaynatan tayta mamakuna sapanka wawankupaq hina estudiota aparinkuman, imaynatan qan wawaykikunata yanaparanki?"
"As your children grow, adapt the study to their needs." "Sapanka wawakunapaq hinan estudiotaqa ruwakunan."
"Note the way one couple helped their teenage children to reason on a request to attend a school dance." "Qhawarisun imaynatan huk tayta mama ususinkunata yanaparanku estudiaqmasinkunawan tusuyman riyta munaqtinku."
"The father says: “We told our children that during a portion of the next family study, my wife and I would play the part of the children, and our girls could pretend to be the parents." "Tayta nin: “Paykunatan nirayku, qatimuq estudiopin qankuna tayta mama kankichis, nispa."
"Either child could assume the role of Father or Mother, but the children had to work together to research the subject and to give direction about school dances. ”" "Ñoqawan warmiywanmi wawakuna kanayku karan, paykunataq tayta mamayku. Paykunaña pin taytapas mamapas kananta akllakunanku karan chaypas iskayninkun tusuq riymanta qelqakunapi t’aqwinanku karan, chayman hinataq yuyaychawananku karan ”, nispa."
"What was the result?" "¿Imapin tukuran?"
"“We were amazed at how responsible our daughters (in their role as the parents) were when explaining to us (as the children) their Bible - based reasons why it would be unwise to go to the dance, ” the father continues." "“Musphariraykun, allin tayta mama hinan allinkaqta mana allinkaqta reparaspa Bibliawan qhawarichiwaranku tusuyman riy mana allin kasqanta."
"“What further impressed us were the suggestions they came up with as acceptable alternatives to this activity." "Tusuyman rinaykumantaqa huk q’ochukuykunata akllarinaykupaqmi yuyaychawaranku, chaymi astawanqa musphachiwaranku."
"These gave us valuable insight into their thinking and desires. ”" "Chaypin yacharayku yuyaykusqankuta ima munasqankutapas ”, nispa."
"True, it requires perseverance and imagination to keep a family study regular and relevant, but the rewards are worth the effort. ​ — Proverbs 23: 15." "Familiapi estudio sapankata yanapananpaqqa tayta mamakunan allin yuyaykuq kananku sapa semanataqmi estudiananku. Chhaynata kallpachakusqankuqa allinpaqmi kanqa (Proverbios 23: 15)."
"Create a Peaceful Environment" "Familia ukhupi thak kawsay kanan"
"13, 14. (a) How can parents create a peaceful home environment?" "13, 14. a) ¿Imatan tayta mamakuna ruwananku familia ukhupi thak kawsay kananpaq?"
"(b) What can be the beneficial result when a parent admits to having made a mistake?" "b) ¿Iman kanman pantasqankuta reqsikuqtinku?"
"An arrow is more likely to hit the target if the archer aims and releases it in calm conditions." "Wach’iqqa thakpin kanan wach’inta allinta takyachispa maychus munasqanman chayachinanpaq."
"Similarly, children are more likely to learn to love Jehovah if parents create a peaceful home environment." "Tayta mamakunapas thakpin kawsananku, chhaynapin wawakuna yachanqaku Jehová Dios munakuyta."
"“The fruit of righteousness has its seed sown under peaceful conditions for those who are making peace, ” wrote James."

"Sichus tayta mamakuna munanakuspa respetanakuspa kawsanqaku chayqa wawankupas chhaynatan runamasinkuta qhawarinqaku, astawanqa Jehová Diosta munakunqaku respetanqakupas."
"Love and respect promote peace." "Qhawarisqanchis hina munakuypas respetopas kaqtinqa familia ukhupin thak kawsay kanqa."
"And a couple who are at peace with each other are better able to deal with conflicts that may arise within the family." "Hinaspapas warmi qhari thakpi kawsaqtinkuqa allin wakichisqan kanku ima sasachakuykunatapas atipanankupaq."
"Of course, just as there are no perfect marriages, there are no perfect families on earth at present." "Ichaqa llapallanchismi kay pachapi huchayoq kanchis."
"Parents may at times fail to display the fruitage of the spirit when dealing with their children." "Chaymi mayninqa tayta mamakuna mana Bibliaq nisqanman hinachu wawankuta tratanku."
"When that happens, what should parents do?" "Chhayna kaqtin, ¿imatan ruwananku?"
"If they admit to making a mistake, will it lessen a child’s respect for them?" "Pantasqankuta reqsikunanku. Chayta ruwaqtinku ¿respetashallanqachu wawankuna?"
"Consider the apostle Paul’s example." "Chaypaq apóstol Pablomanta yachasun."
"He was like a spiritual father to many." "Payqa askha cristianokunaq espiritual taytanmi karan."
"Yet, he openly admitted that he made mistakes." "Chaywanpas pantaq kasqantan reqsikuran."
"Even so, his humility and honesty raise our respect for him rather than diminish it." "K’umuykukuq honrado kasqanmantan paytaqa astawan respetanchis."
"Despite his shortcomings, Paul could confidently write to the congregation in Corinth: “Become imitators of me, even as I am of Christ. ”" "Pantaqña karan chaypas Corinto llaqtapi cristianokunatan niran: “Ñoqamanta yachaqakuychis, imaynan ñoqapas Cristomanta yachaqakuni hinata ”, nispa."
"If you too admit your mistakes, your children will likely overlook your failings." "Tayta mamakuna, sichus qankunapas pantasqaykichista reqsikunkichis chayqa wawaykichisqa qonqapunqan ima pantasqaykichistapas."
"15, 16." "15, 16."
"Why should parents train their children to love their Christian brothers and sisters, and how can this be done?" "¿Imarayku tayta mamakuna wawaykichista yanapanaykichis wayqe panakunata munakunankupaq, imaynatataq chayta ruwawaqchis?"
"What else can parents do to create an environment where their children can grow to love Jehovah?" "Tayta mamakuna, ¿imatawanmi ruwawaqchis wawaykichis Jehová Diosta munakunankupaq?"
"The apostle John wrote: “If anyone makes the statement: ‘ I love God, ’ and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar." "Apóstol Juanpa qelqasqanta yuyarinaykichis: “Pipas iñiqmasinta cheqnikushaspa: ‘ Ñoqaqa munakunin Diosta ’, niqqa llullan."
"For he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot be loving God, whom he has not seen. ”" "Rikushasqan iñiqmasinta mana munakunchu chayqa, ¿imaynatan munakunman mana rikusqan Diostaqa? ”."
"Therefore, when you train your children to love their Christian brothers and sisters, you are teaching them to love God." "Sichus wawaykichista yachachinkichis wayqe panakuna munakuyta chayqa Jehová Diostapas munakunqakun."
"Parents do well to ask themselves, ‘ Is the dominant tone of my conversations about the congregation encouraging or critical? ’" "Tapukuychis: “¿Imaynatan rimani wayqe panakunamanta?"

"Consider again the illustration of the archer." "Wakmanta qhawarisun wach’iqmanta."
"Although he may be skilled, he is unlikely to hit the target if the arrow he shoots has become bent or warped." "Allin yachaqña kanman chaypas wach’in q’ewesqa kaqtinqa manan munasqanman chayachinqachu."
"Of course, parents will try hard to straighten the bent arrow, so to speak, by striving to adjust a child’s wrong thinking." "Sichus wayna sipaskuna q’ewesqa wach’i hina kanqaku chayqa tayta mamakuna kallpachakunanku yanapanankupaq."
"But children must eventually decide for themselves whether to let this world bend them to its will or to allow Jehovah to make their “paths straight. ” ​ — Proverbs 3: 5, 6; Romans 12: 2." "Ichaqa imaynaña kaqtinpas wayna sipaskunan akllanqaku kay millay pachawan pusachikuyta otaq Jehová Dioswan ‘ cheqaq ñanninta pusachikuyta ’ (Proverbios 3: 5, 6; Romanos 12: 2)."
"What effect can a child’s choice have on others?" "¿Imaynatan tayta mamakunapas Jehová Diospas sientekunqaku wayna sipaskuna allinta akllakuqtinku?"
"While parents have a weighty responsibility to raise their children in “the discipline and mental - regulating of Jehovah, ” the final decision as to what a child will grow up to become rests with the child himself." "Tayta mamakunan “Señormanta yachachispa ” wawankuta uywananku, ichaqa wayna sipaskunan akllakunanku kanqa kuraq kaspa ima ruwanankutapas."
"Therefore, children, ask yourselves, ‘ Will I accept the loving training my parents provide? ’" "Wayna sipaskuna, ¿munakuq tayta mamaykichispa yachachisqanman hinachu kawsankichis?"

"Consider what Jesus said to the Pharisees, who manifested an unmerciful attitude." "Chaytan Jesuspas niran fariseokunaman mana khuyapayakuq kasqankurayku."
"On two occasions he rebuked them, pointing out that God had decreed: “I want mercy, and not sacrifice. ”" "Iskay kutipin Jesús fariseokunata yuyarichiran Diospa nisqanta: “Khuyapayakuq kanaykichistan munani, manan sacrificio haywawanaykichistachu munani ”, nispa."

"Perhaps the baby is hungry or has some other need. Moved by the feelings of compassion or sympathy that this stirs in her, the mother attends to her infant’s need." "Wawacha yarqaymanta otaq imamantapas waqaqtinqa mamanqa llakipayaspan usqhaylla wawachanman qon ima necesitasqanta."

"He told Moses: “Unquestionably I have seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their outcry as a result of those who drive them to work; because I well know the pains they suffer." "Jehová Diosmi Moisesta niran: “Allintan rikuni llaqtaypa Egipto suyupi muchushasqanta, uyarinin muchuchiqkuna hawa waqyakamusqankuta, yachanitaqmi ñak’arishasqankutapas."

"About 500 years after the Israelites were delivered from Egypt, Jehovah reminded them: “It was I who brought Israel up out of Egypt and who went delivering you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you. ”" "Llaqtanta horqomusqan phisqa pachak wataña kashaqtintaq Jehová Diosqa yuyarichiran: “Ñoqan horqomurqaykichis Egipto suyumanta chay runakunaq kamachinpi kashaqtiykichis, kaqllataq wakin llakichiqniykichis llaqtakunamantapas horqorqaykichis ”, nispa (1 Samuel 10: 18)."
"Because of deviating from God’s righteous standards, the Israelites were frequently in sore straits." "Sapa kutillan Israel runakunaqa sasachakuykunapi rikukuranku."

"What do the examples of Jehovah God and his Son teach us about mercy?" "¿Imatan yachanchis Jehová Diospa Jesuspa khuyapayakuq kasqankumanta?"
"The examples of Jehovah God and Jesus Christ show that mercy has two components ​ — feelings of compassion, sympathy, or pity toward the disadvantaged and action that brings relief to the recipient." "Jehová Dios hina Jesucristo hina khuyapayakuq kanapaqqa kaykunata ruwana: necesitaqkunata llakipayana, sasachakuyninkupitaq yanapana."
"Being merciful requires both elements." "Iskaynintan ruwananchis khuyapayakuq kanapaqqa."
"In the Scriptures, mercy most often refers to a positive expression of kind consideration toward those in need." "Bibliaqa khuyapayakuyta yaqa llapanpi tupanachin necesitaqkunata yanapaywan."
"How, though, is mercy displayed in a judicial context? Does it also involve what might be viewed as a negative action, such as a holding back of punishment?" "Ichaqa pipas mana allin ruwasqanmanta juiciopi kashaqtin, ¿khuyapayasqa kasqanraykuchu mana wanachisqa kanman?"

"According to the Mosaic Law, both David and Bath - sheba should have been put to death." "Jehová Diosqa manan wañuchiranchu, ichaqa manan pakaykuranchu huchallikusqanku hawa sasachakuykunapi tarikunankumanta (2 Samuel 12: 13)."

"Hence, Jehovah God, “the Judge of all the earth, ” who is“ an examiner of the heart, ” chose to handle the matter himself." "Chaymi ‘ kay pachantin Juez ’, “sonqokuna t’aqwiq ” Jehová Diosqa pay kikinpuni Davidta juzgaran (Génesis 18: 25; 1 Crónicas 29: 17)."

"A God of Mercy and Justice" "Diosqa chanintaq khuyapayakuqtaq"
"13, 14." "13, 14."
"Does God’s mercy temper his justice?" "¿Diospa khuyapayakuynin llamp’uyachinchu chanin kayninta?"
Explain. Willay.
"While Jehovah’s mercy does not violate his standard of justice, does it in some way affect his justice? Does mercy lessen the impact of divine justice by tempering it?" "Jehová Diosqa manan chanin kayninta qhepanchanchu khuyapayananraykuqa, manataqmi khuyapayakuq kayninqa llamp’uyachinchu chanin kayninta."
"No, it does not. Through the prophet Hosea, Jehovah told the Israelites: “I will engage you to me for time indefinite, and I will engage you to me in righteousness and in justice and in loving - kindness and in mercies. ”" "Profeta Oseaswanmi Jehová Diosqa Israel runakunata niran: “Israel llaqta, ñoqan qanwan wiñaypaq casarakusaq, chaninninpin qanwan casarakusaq, sumaqtan uywasqayki, tukuy tiempon munakusqayki, khuyapayasqaykipas ”, nispa (Oseas 2: 19)."
"These words clearly show that Jehovah’s exercise of mercy is always in harmony with his other attributes, including justice." "Kaypin yachanchis Jehová Diospa khuyapayakuyninqa chanin kayninwan wakin sumaq kayninkunawanpas tupasqanta."
"Jehovah is “a God merciful and gracious,... pardoning error and transgression and sin, but by no means will he give exemption from punishment. ”" "Payqa ‘ khuyapayakuq sumaq sonqo Diosmi [...], huchallikusqatapas, mana kasukusqatapas, huchatapas pampachaqmi, [ichaqa] huchallikuqtaqa manapunin hinallatachu qhawanqa ’ aswanpas muchuchinqapunin (Éxodo 34: 6, 7)."
"Jehovah is a God of mercy and justice." "Arí, Jehová Diosqa khuyapayakuqmi chanintaqmi."
"Concerning him, the Bible states: “The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. ”" "Hunt’asqan ruwasqankunaqa, chaninmi ruwasqankunaqa ”, nispa (Deuteronomio 32: 4)."
"God’s justice is perfect, as is his mercy." "Diospa chanin kayninpas khuyapayakuyninpas hunt’asqan."
"Neither is superior to the other, nor does one need the other to temper its effect." "Manan hukninchu aswan hatun hukkaqmanta, nitaqmi hukkaqchu llamp’uyachin hukkaq sumaq kayninta."
"Rather, both qualities work in perfect harmony with each other." "Diospa khuyapayakuynin chanin kayninwanqa allin tupanasqan kashan."
"15, 16. (a) What shows that divine justice is not harsh?" "15, 16. a) ¿Iman rikuchin Diospa chanin kaynin khuyapayakuq kasqanta?"
"(b) When Jehovah executes his judgment upon this wicked system of things, of what can his worshippers be sure?" "b) ¿Imatan Jehová Dios kamachinkunapaq ruwanqa mana allin kawsayta chinkachishaqtin?"
"Jehovah’s justice is not harsh." "Jehová Diospa chanin kayninqa manan mana khuyapayakuqchu."
"Justice almost invariably has legal implications, and judgment usually calls for the meting out of deserved punishment to wrongdoers." "Chanin kaymantaqa rimallankupunin juiciokunapi, tupachinkutaqmi leykunata mana kasukuqkunata huchachaywan."
"However, godly justice can also involve salvation for deserving ones." "Diospa chanin kayninqa manan chayllatachu ruwan, aswanpas qespichillantaqmi allin sonqoyoq runakunata."
"For example, when the wicked in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah met their end, the patriarch Lot and his two daughters were saved. ​ — Genesis 19: 12 - 26." "Ejemplopaq, Jehová Dios Sodoma Gomorra llaqtakunapi tiyaqkunata wañuchishaqtinqa qespichiranmi Lotta iskaynin ususinkunatawan (Génesis 19: 12 - 26)."
"We can be confident that when Jehovah executes his judgment upon the present wicked system of things, the “great crowd ” of true worshippers, who“ have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, ” will be spared." "Chaywanmi yachanchis, Jehová Dios kay pachamanta mana allin kawsayta tukuchishaqtinqa qespichinqan “ancha askha runakunata ”."
"Thus, they will “come out of the great tribulation. ” ​ — Revelation 7: 9 - 14." "Kay Diospa kamachinkunan ‘ p’achankuta t’aqsaspa Corderoq yawarninpi yuraqyachiranku ’ chaymi ‘ manchay ñak’ariymanta lloqsinqaku ’."
"Why Be Merciful?" "¿Imaraykun khuyapayakuq kananchis?"
"What is a fundamental reason to be merciful?" "¿Imaraykun khuyapayakuq kananchis?"
"The examples of Jehovah and Jesus Christ indeed teach us what true mercy is." "Kunanqa yachasun imarayku khuyapayakuq kananchismanta."
"Giving us a fundamental reason to be merciful, Proverbs 19: 17 states: “He that is showing favor to the lowly one is lending to Jehovah, and his treatment He will repay to him. ”" "Proverbios 19: 17 nin: “Wakcha runaman manuyqa Señor Diosman manuymi, Señor Diosmi manusqantaqa kutichipunqa ”, nispa."
"Jehovah is pleased when we imitate him and his Son by being merciful in our dealings with one another." "Jehová Diosqa anchata kusikun paytapas Churintapas qatikuspa runamasinchista khuyapayaqtinchis."
"And others are encouraged to be merciful, for mercy begets mercy. ​ — Luke 6: 38." "Khuyapayakuq kaspanchismi hukkunatapas kallpachasunchis khuyapayakuq kanankupaq."
"Why should we strive to be merciful?" "¿Imaraykun kallpachakunanchis khuyapayakuq kanapaq?"
"Mercy is a blend of many good qualities. It involves graciousness, love, kindness, and goodness." "Khuyapayakuq runaqa munakuqmi, qoykukuqmi, sumaq sonqotaqmi."
"Tender feelings of compassion or sympathy are at the root of acts of mercy." "Yachasqanchispas hina, khuyapayakuq kanapaqqa llakipayakuq khuyay munakuqmi kananchis."
"While godly mercy does not compromise justice, Jehovah is slow to anger and patiently gives wrongdoers sufficient time to attain to repentance." "Jehová Diosqa khuyapayakuq kaspanmi mana usqhayllachu phiñakun, pacienciakunmi huchasapakunawanpas chaymi tiempota qon huchankuta saqespa payman kutirikunankupaq, chaywanpas payqa manan p’akinchu chanin kamachikuyninkunata."
"Mercy is thus related to patience and long - suffering." "Kaypi rikusqanchis hina khuyapayakuywan pacienciakuywanqa tupanasqan kashan."
"As a combination of many desirable traits ​ — including various aspects of the fruitage of God’s spirit — ​ mercy becomes a framework within which these qualities may be cultivated." "Khuyapayakuq kaspanchisqa askha sumaq kaykunatan ñoqanchispi wiñachisun, santo espirituq rurunpa wakin sumaq kayninkunatapas wiñachillasuntaqmi."
"How vital that we strive to be merciful!" "Chayraykun kallpachakunanchis khuyapayakuqpuni kanapaq."
"“Happy Are the Merciful ”" "“Kusisamiyoqmi khuyapayakuqkunaqa ”"
"19, 20." "19, 20."
"In what way does mercy exult over judgment?" "¿Imaynapitaq khuyapayakuqkuna taripay p’unchaypi atipaqkuna kanqaku?"
"The disciple James tells us why we should make mercy an essential quality in our lives." "Santiago willaran imarayku khuyapayakuq kananchista, paymi niran: “Khuyapayakuqkunan ichaqa taripay p’unchaypi atipaqkuna kanqaku ”, nispa."
"He wrote: “Mercy exults triumphantly over judgment. ”" "Kaypiqa Santiago rimasharan Jehová Diospa kamachinkuna runamasinkuta khuyapayanankumanta."
"James was speaking of the mercy that a worshipper of Jehovah shows toward others." "¿Imaynapitaq khuyapayakuqkuna taripay p’unchaypi atipaqkuna kanqaku?"
"It exults triumphantly over judgment in that when the time comes for a person to “render an account for himself to God, ” Jehovah takes into consideration his merciful dealings and forgives him on the basis of the ransom sacrifice of His Son." "Jehová Dios runakunamanta cuentata mañaqtinmi payqa yuyarinqa khuyapayakuq runakunata, pampachanqataq huchankuta Jesuspa wañusqanpi iñisqankurayku."
"No doubt, one of the reasons why David was shown mercy for his sin with Bath - sheba was that he himself was a merciful man." "Davidpas Bat - sebawan huchallikusqanmanta khuyapayasqa karan pay khuyapayakuq kasqanrayku (1 Samuel 24: 4 - 7)."
